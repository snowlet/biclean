Previously on "The Blacklist"...
- You want to call your daddy?
- Yeah, I want to tell him I'm okay.
Okay.
Lizzy... Be careful of your husband.
I can only lead you to the truth.
I can't make you believe it.
She's calling herself Jolene Parker.
Elizabeth Keen is not your wife, she's your target.
You have been threatening to tell me the truth about my husband since the day we met, and I'm ready to listen.
Right now, the only thing that matters is the immediate threat... Your husband...
Finding out who he is and who he works for.
The rest will come. I promise you.


-
Asset on board. En route.
12 cc epinephrine.
Clear.

- 45 seconds.
-

-

We need more adrenaline.
Cover her mouth.
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay. Shh!
You'll be in America by morning.
We're taking you to Washington, D.C.
Do you know where the prisoner was transported to?
Uh, Washington. Okay. Yes, we'll take care of it.
Very good.
-
Washington?
Since when did Jolene Parker's case go from missing person to murder investigation?
- And have you seen my keys?
- It's crazy, right?
Yeah, what, uh...
What happened?
The police say they have a person of interest.
Really?
Who is it?
What do they...
What do they know?
They're not sure.
Isn't it possible that she just left town like she said? Moved to Dayton?
They found blood...
Matches hers.
You see this stuff every day...
You know, people getting hurt and killed... and...
I don't.
It freaks me out.
Just the thought of that happening to you, you know...
Just promise me you're as careful as you can be when you're at work.
- The desk.
- Hmm?
By the computer...
That's where I saw your keys. Oh.
I'm gonna be so late. I'm gonna give myself a tardy slip.
Found 'em!
They were under the newspaper.
What would I do without you?
I got to run.
Uh, tonight for dinner, let's check out that new thai place.
He knows something's off.
What makes you say that?
I can feel it. I know him.
Tom is on his heels. He's behaving erratically.
He killed Jolene Parker.
Yes.
You knew?
Why didn't you tell me?
I felt if I told you it would inform your behavior with him.
I found her body, called the police, and reported a missing person.
I was confident, in the course of their investigation, they would reach out to you and Tom, and they did.
Jolene Parker undoubtedly worked for the same organization as Tom...
In what capacity, I have no idea.
If they worked together, why would he murder her?
Perhaps he was ordered to.
Or perhaps he's just...
Out of control, irrational...
Paranoid and reactionary.
He's scrambling for a foothold, and therein lies our opportunity to wait and to watch.
But Tom is not the reason I'm here.
I'm afraid there's something quite timely afoot.
The Pavlovich brothers are back in town.
You're talking about the team from the bridge that grabbed the general's daughter.
They're an extraction team...
Cut their teeth on Milosevic's protective detail during the ethnic cleansing of the Yugoslav wars.
We lost six of our men that day.
To the best of our knowledge, the Pavlovich brothers have no political agenda.
They specialize in snatch-and-grabs ranging from kidnap and ransom to extracting political dissidents.
Reddington says he has a contact.
A money launderer sourced by the brothers claims they're coming after a Chinese scientist named Xiaoping Li.
- What do we know about her?
- 18 hours ago, the agency sent an undercover team to extract her from a clandestine labor camp in the Yunnan province.
- Break her out?
Why? - She's an immunologist...
Specializes in viral and bacterial diseases.
Four months ago, she signaled to one of our assets that she had a willingness to talk about a secret weapons program.
A month later, she was jailed for treason.
She's scheduled to land at Andrews in an under an hour, and we have a team standing by to escort her to Langley
- for a debriefing. - We got to assume that the Pavlovich brothers already know the route.
Well, then we'll reroute her. Bring her here.
Coordinate the adjustment with Langley.
Echo to tango. Uh, asset at drop point.
Roger. 30 seconds to rendezvous.
- This way. Quickly.
- What's going on?
They said I'd be safe once I arrived.
We have a credible threat you're being targeted.
As a precaution, we've altered our route. Get her up to the chopper.
Donald Ressler. FBI. Where's the asset?
- Ground transport's been arranged.
- Negative.
Evac's been compromised. Moving to beta proto...
Call it in.
All right. Okay. Copy that.
Anne Arundel county sheriff's department's reporting a downed aircraft burning two miles outside of Crofton.
There's no witnesses on the ground.
We do have units en route. It's got to be the dump site
- on this chopper. - They knew CIA protocol...
That if the routes were compromised, they'd send in air support. These guys weren't based domestically.
They snuck in, and they're gonna sneak out.
We should coordinate with homeland, get their faces everywhere.
Agent Malik, you want to tell me why the director of national intelligence is calling?
What don't I know about this case?
The program li was working on... It's germ weaponry...
Banned by nearly every nation on Earth. It's called Whitefog.
Day before she was jailed, Xiaoping Li sent a message indicating that she had access to the designs.
If she did, and she shared those with us, that would represent the biggest intelligence coup in a decade.
A germ-warfare program?
That's why the Chinese can't turn this into an international incident.
- Where are you?
- Busy.
The brothers... They took Xiaoping Li.
How do you know?
Do you have a lead?
Something we can...
- Your husband is not in school.
- Wait. What?
Where is he?
Meet me at 9th and Constitution.
Reddington says he has a lead on the brothers. Wants to talk.
Let me know what NTSB says about that downed aircraft.
Called in sick this morning.
Returned home briefly before making a stop at the Radford Bank in Adams Morgan.
He's made three phone calls...
All from pay phones.
He's been sitting at that cart for nearly an hour.
I'm sorry, Lizzy.
Don't be.
This must be difficult.
You want to know what's hard?
Sitting here when all I really want to do is get my hands around his throat.
- Shouldn't we follow him?
They all work for you.
Lizzy, wait, wait, wait. What are you do...
Not now.
The boat... How long for the boat?
No. No. Please, no.
Tom?
Tom?
I'm in the dining room.
Where'd you get that thing?
I was gonna ask you the same question.
I found it in the basement.
That's where that was. I've been looking for it.
My father gave it to me.
It's beautiful.
It's in great condition, too.
Why haven't I seen this before?
Your pot is gonna boil over.
You're cooking?
I thought we were going out for thai.
Yeah, well, I just thought it might be nice, you know, to stay home alone... Just you and me.
How was your day?
It was exhausting.
You know Billy Salter?
He was acting up again 'cause his mom keeps packing these fruit roll-ups, and they give him this satanic sugar high, you know.
Oh, uh, I did stop by the national archives just to maybe book a field trip for the kids.
It's funny.
I, uh... I could have sworn that I saw you there.
There was a woman there, and she looked just like you.
Ah, no, I wish. I was cooped up in the office all day.
Yeah. Should have known.
Well, whoever she was, she could not have been half as beautiful as you are right now.
All right.
Uh, keep stirring. I'm gonna walk the dog.
Come on, bud. Hey, hey, hey.
Come here. Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?
Come here. Come here.
Yes, you're a good boy. Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.
What?
Nothing.
Love you.
- I'll be right back. Come on, bud. - Come on.
Come on. Such a good boy.
You're a good boy. Yes, yes, yes.
Bantam finance. How may I direct your call?
Hi. I'm having a problem with my account.
Uh, number Delta, Sierra, 4-5-1.
Line is secure.
Proceed. Mockingbird knows. Requesting immediate evac.
She knows.
He's gone.
My husband is gone.
Your husband never existed.
Lizzy, I understand why you went after Tom today.
The instinct to jump in is...
But it isn't gonna serve you well here.
And from the emotional point of view, this must feel like an extraordinary violation and betrayal.
But for Tom it was business.
Do you know we had sex the other night?
Do you have any idea how filthy that makes me feel?
Unfortunately, Lizzy, you're chest-deep in filth, and you're gonna have to wade through it
- to get to the other side.
- I fell in love with him.
I married him.
We... we were gonna have...
I was excited to have a child with him.
He was the one person I chose in my life who made me happy, who made me feel safe.
What does that say about me?
Everything that we had was just a figment of my imagination...
Worse than a figment...
A lie.
It was right in front of my face, and I didn't see it.
I just... believed it.
All of it.
Time is the only thing that will allow you to find yourself again.
If you tell me to be patient one more time, I swear to God...
I am going to find him, I'm gonna find answers, and I'm going to do it with or without your help.
The case. I need a lead.
Lizzy, if you want to find where the Pavlovich brothers are, you need to find out where they've been.
The helicopter is key.
The Pavlovich brothers burnt that chopper to cover up evidence... DNA, fingerprints.
Those things might have identified the brothers, but what about the chopper?
The tail numbers were falsified, and the chopper was repainted.
That's what they did, but where did they do it?
Is there a deeper forensic analysis we can run?
What particulates were in the heat exchange?
Was there moisture in the compressor?
I'll reach out to forensics.
Analyze every drop of fuel. Track every grain of sand.
I want to know where that chopper's been.
That's him.
I'm sorry, man. Not for hire.
Hello, Symir. I'll be brief and to the point.
Yesterday you had a customer...
Picked him up outside the national archives.
Sorry, man.
Ohh, Symir. You should have taken the money.
Your passenger... Where'd you drop him?
Calculus.
I can't even think about derivatives without thinking of that tutor in manor hall...
Cindy something-or-other.
Never wore a brassiere; Always a bounce in her step.
Look, I'm talking, cooperating.
You don't need to copy my driver's license, my credit cards.
We just want to make sure we know where to reach you,
Geoffrey P. Seevers, should we have more questions.
So, tell me about the book.
I told you...
I pick up and drop off.
I don't know names. I'm the messenger.
What is it?
Some kind of code?
How many times have you done this... these drops?
This was the fourth.
I need you to write down the location of each drop you've made...
The pickup and the drop location.
Oh, my God.
What? Pagosa Springs public library?
I had a water pump go out in Pagosa Springs.
Bitch of a mountain... Wolf Creek Pass.
Thought I was gonna end up living out there with the hill people until this Teddy bear of a man fixed me up at the local garage.
I'll never forget him. Tracy Woods.
You don't know Tracy, do you?
Leather vest, mustache...
Tracy Woods?
No.
I wonder if he's still fixing water pumps.
Anyway, it'll always be a fond memory.
The list.
S-so, that's it?
We're...
What about the package?
You're gonna deliver it or return it or whatever the people you work for want you to do with it.
And as far as you're concerned, we never had this conversation.
Dembe?
A copy, please.
I hope you have nothing pressing. This may take a minute or three.
You sure you don't know him?
Leather vest, mustache...
Tracy Woods?
Shame.
I got something.
Hey.
Okay, I never wanted to know this much about gas chromatography or gear lubricants, but I think Mr. Reddington is onto something.
Look at this.
We pulled the lab reports from the NTSB, and the chopper's engine tested positive for two distinct compounds.
The first is ethephon, which is a ripening agent for tobacco.
- And how does that help us?
- Take a look.
Tobacco production's way down in this area.
In fact, since 1998, the federal government is actually paying farmers not to grow it.
Okay, but there's still plenty of tobacco farms.
I agree, which brings us to chemical compound number two.
This one is used to grow sweet corn.
So we cross-reference the two?
Exactly. We are looking for a pesticide manufacturer who used to supply tobacco growers but made the transition to corn.
And how many of those are there?
17. Wait.
Of those, 11 are outside of the fuel range of this chopper.
Uh, of the other six, uh, only one has a structure large enough to get that stolen helicopter out of view and under construction.
Halifax Agro-Chem.
If I had to bet, I'd say that's their staging site.
It's around the corner, half a block up.
I make seven exterior cameras, and those are the ones they want us to see.
And it's on the list of drop sites I gave you?
Yes.
How long has Mr. Keen been inside?
I tailed him here four hours ago.
Lovely. Thank you, Preston.
- You want me to call Sabusawa?
- That would be ideal, but he's working an extraction in Ecuador.
Then how do you plan on getting keen out of that concrete box?
- We have a lead on Xiaoping Li.
- Excellent.
- Tell me. - We think she's being held at Halifax Agro-Chem in Falls Church.
We're assembling a team.
Lizzy, about Tom...
I don't want to talk about Tom with you.
You have your opinion on how to proceed, and I have mine.
Just don't bother yourself. I'll deal with Tom.
Lizzy, I assure you that will yield no answers and little satisfaction.
Well, I'll find out, won't I?
I wish I could talk you out of this.
You can't.
Well, good luck with Xiaoping...
Good afternoon, gentlemen. I'm Raymond Reddington.
Hey. Look at this.
What are we looking at?
I have no idea.
Hey! Get out of here!
Go!

What the hell was that?
Out! Out!
Move!
Move!
Move!
Fall back. Asset en route. We're moving to the cars.
-
-
-
-
I mean, it looks like some sort of serial number.
Or an atomic number...
Something from a periodic table.
Why do you think that?
Because the only word I know that contains the letters "v-g" together is avgolemono.
I don't know what that is.
It's a soup.
Chicken stock, egg yolks, and lemon juice.
What?
I cook.
The point is, maybe Xiaoping Li left us a message.
I'll run the letter combination against the DMV registry
- and see if we can get a hit.
- Any luck?
- I can't get ahold of Reddington.
- You told him the location where the brothers were holding Xiaoping Li, right?
- Mm-hmm. - Don't you find it a hell of a coincidence that we show up there, they're gone, and now we can't get ahold of Reddington?
- We've been played.
- No.
Red put us on to the Pavlovich brothers because he knew it would lead him straight to Xiaoping Li.
That woman's worth millions.
Where are you going? I'm going to find Reddington, get some answers.
Reddington, I need you to call me, please.
I need some help with the case.
A gift from Reddington. Enjoy.
Two years wasted.
Two years we spent. On what?
Do you care at all what you've done to me...
What you've done to my life?
What has it done to you?
Who could do such a thing?
Finding you, stopping you...
You'd think I'd be happy you're gonna spend the rest of your life in prison.
You'd think I'd get some satisfaction out of that, but I don't because nothing...
No sentence, no punishment, no revenge, could ever come close to making up for what you've done.
- I was doing my job.
- Your job?
That was our life!
We were going to have a baby to...
You begged me to have a baby!
- I was doing my job.
- Stop talking about your job!
You, this... Everything was a lie!
My life was a lie!
Every feeling, every memory...
Say something to your wife, who's dying in front of you.
Say something.
It was the shoes.
What does that mean?
That's when I knew.
It was those brown leather shoes.
It was our third or maybe fourth date.
You'd come over to my place on Halstead, and we ordered, uh...
Takeout and rented a movie that we never finished because we ended up...
And you had to get up early for work. And by the time I got up, you were gone.
I remember standing in the closet, half-dressed, reaching for my shoes when I saw that you had drawn this little heart
In the dust on my shoe.
You remember that?
It was the sweetest thing.
And ever since that moment, I just felt...
Sorry for you...
Because I knew...
I knew that I had you.
Part of me didn't want it to work...
But it did.
Archimedes.
- I beg your pardon?
- Archimedes' formula.
You know, uh, the... the naked guy who shouted "Eureka."
Why would she write down a mathematical formula?
Maybe it's some kind of a code or a language they don't understand.
Archimedes' principle indicates that the upward buoyant force which is exerted on a body immersed in fluid,
- whether fully... - Aram.
Um, water displacement. Boats displace water.
She's trying to tell us how they're getting her out of the country.
Contact the coast guard.
Get photos of the brothers and Xiaoping Li to every port authority on the eastern seaboard.
What are you gonna tell him?
Hey. What's going on?
Where are we on Xiaoping Li?
They're trying to ship her out of the country.
We're combing through the manifests now. Where are you?
Waiting on Reddington. He still hasn't shown.
I'm telling you, Keen. He used us.
These guys... The Pavlovich brothers...
You remember what they did. You were there that day on the bridge.
When we take them down, I want you to be there.
I will be, just as soon as...
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Nice try.
I was thirsty.
Yes?
- Where is she?
- Who?
Xiaoping Li. You took her.
You used the FBI and the Pavlovich brothers to get to Tom and what, get Xiaoping?
Make some bigger deal?
Trade on her secrets?
I have no use for germ warfare. And as for using the FBI?
I wouldn't be in this relationship if there wasn't a mutual benefit.
- Where is she?
- I don't know.
I tried to bargain for her life, but negotiations went sideways.
It was all I could do to get Tom.
If we don't find her...
If she gets sent back to the Chinese, - she's gonna die.
- Tell me what you know.
We think they're putting her on a cargo ship. We're not sure.
We're looking over the manifests, timetables,
- and shipping routes. - She isn't cargo, Lizzy.
She's contraband. This is a smuggling operation.
And nothing gets smuggled in or out of the chesapeake without Rolph Cisco knowing about it.
Have Donald pay him a visit.
What is his obsession with you?
You guys got, like, a, uh, daddy-daughter thing going on?
What's your plan?
Is daddy coming over?
Is he gonna make me talk?
No, he's not.
I am.
Rolph Cisco?
Tell us about the Pavlovich brothers.
Who do you work for?
I have nothing to say.
- Who do you work for?
- Liz, come on.
You don't have it in you.
Aah! God!
Aah!
Let me out of here!
Get me out!
Get me out!
It's okay. It's okay.
Easy, easy. We're the good guys. Here.
Come here.
I'm gonna put you down.
Easy.
You broke my thumb.
Yeah, I did. If you're looking for sympathy, you might want to start with honesty.
Here's an example of honesty, Tom.
You've been making me pancakes for two years.
- I hate pancakes.
- You want honest?
Here's one.
If you're gonna handcuff somebody, don't break their thumb.
Your handcuffs.
One on the wrist. One on the banister.
I am not here to hurt you, Liz.
My job was never to hurt you.
I'm one of the good guys.
Reddington...
He's not who you think.
- I will find you.
- I can prove it.
The key in the lamp...
I know you found it.
Take it to radford bank. Box number 3929.
He is not who you think he is.
Goodbye, Liz.
You want me to stop him?
No, we'll just let the tail follow him.
Tell me about Whitefog.
Whitefog was a black project started
By the Chinese government five years ago.
You want to tell me what's going on with Agent Keen?
- Sir?
- Where was she today?
And don't tell me you don't know. Was it Reddington?
Are there problems?
I think she's having troubles at home, sir.
I lost him.
He's gone.
No.
This whole time, you've never let him out of your sight.
Your people are following him now.
They are.
How is this all gonna end?
This is an end.
And then something new will begin.
You deserve the best in life, Lizzy.
I know that sounds odd coming from a man who has brought you some of the worst,
but it's the reason why Tom had to work so hard to be that for you...
To be kind, to be thoughtful, make you laugh, to make you love him.
Because you deserve that.
And it will come.
A Sun-play of the Ages _ INTOLERANCE
A drama of Comparisons _ ACT I
Our play is made up of four separate stories, laid in different periods of history, each with its own set of characters.
ــــــــــــــــ Each story shows how hatred and intolerance, through all the ages, have battled against love and charity.
ــــــــــــــ Therefore, you will find our play turning from one of the four stories to another, ــــــــــــــ as the common theme unfolds in each.
ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ Out of the cradle endlessly rocking. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
Today as yesterday, endlessly rocking, ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ ever bringing the same human passions, the same joys and sorrows. ــــــــــــــ
Intolerance
¶ Our first story...out of the cradle of the present.
¶ In a western city we find certain ambitious ladies banded together for the "uplift" of humanity.
Even reform movements must be financed.
"If we can only interest Miss Jenkins...
with her money..."
A little affair is being given by Mary T. Jenkins, unmarried sister of the autocratic industrial overlord... ـــــــ
Seeing youth drawn to youth, Miss Jenkins realizes the bitter fact that ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ she is no longer a part of the younger world. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
The girl of our story keeps house for her father who works in a Jenkins mill.
With a wage of $2.75 a day, a little garden, four hens, ditto geese, and a fair measure of happiness and contentment.
The little Dear One.
The Boy, unacquainted with the little Dear One, is employed with his father in the same mill. ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
¶ Age intolerant of youth and laughter.
¶ "The vestal virgins of Uplift" succeed in reaching Miss Jenkins in their search for funds.
Comes now from out the cradle of yesterday, the story of an ancient people, whose lives, though far away from ours, run parallel in their hopes and perplexities.
The Gospels of Matthew and Luke identify Bethlehem as the birthplace of Jesus.
Ancient Jerusalem, the golden city whose people have given us many of our highest ideals, and from the carpenter shop of Bethlehem, sent us the Man of Men, the greatest enemy of intolerance.
Near the Jaffa gate.
The house in Cana of Galilee
Certain hypocrites among the Pharisees.
Pharisee... A learned Jewish party, the name possibly brought into disrepute later by hypocrites among them.
When these Pharisees pray they demand that all action cease.
Oh Lord, I thank thee that I am better than other men.
Amen.
¶ Another period of the past.
¶ A.D. 1572...
Paris, a hotbed of intolerance, in the time of Catherine de Medici, and her son Charles IX, King of France.
Charles IX receiving his brother, Monsieur La France, Duc d'Anjou.
¶ The heir to the throne, the effeminate Monsieur La France.
Catherine de Medici, queen-mother who covers her political intolerance of the Huguenots... beneath the cloak of the great Catholic Religion.
The great Protestant leader, the Admiral Coligny, head of the Huguenot party.
What a wonderful man, the Admiral Coligny, if he only thought as we do.
What a wonderful king, if he only thought as we do.
The King's favor to Coligny increases the hatred of the opposite party.
Celebrating the betrothal of Marguerite of Valois, sister of the King, to Henry of Navarre, royal Huguenot, to insure peace in the place of intolerance.
Marguerite of Valois.
Henry of Navarre.
Brown Eyes, her family of the Huguenot party, and her sweetheart, Prosper Latour.
Brown Eyes attracts the attention of a mercenary soldier.
Returning to our story of today, we find the embittered Miss Jenkins... aligning herself with the modern Pharisees and agreeing to help the Uplifters.
A diversion of the mill workers.
To every thing there is a season...
a time to mourn and a time to dance......
He hath made everything beautiful in his time. Ecclesiastes iii.
The little Dear One having the time of her life. ـــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــ
Want my straw? ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
Miss Jenkins receives a check from her brother for the purposed uplift of humanity. ـــــــــ
Jenkins studies his employes' habits. ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
Ten o'clock! They should be in bed so they can work tomorrow. ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
And now our fourth story of love's struggle against Intolerance, in that distant time when all the nations of the earth sat at the feet of Babylon.
Outside of Imgur Bel, the great gate of Babylon, in the time of Belshazzar, 539 B.C.
Merchants, farmers, East Indians, with trains of elephants, Egyptians, Numidians, and ambitious Persians spying upon the city.
The Mountain Girl down from the mountains of Suisana.
The Rhapsode, a Warrior singer... poet agent of the High Priest of Bel.
The priest of Bel-Marduk, supreme God of Babylon, jealously watches the image of the rival goddess,
Ishtar, enter the city, borne in a sacred ark.
Dearest one...in the ash heaps of my backyard there will be small flowers; seven lilies...if thou wilt love me...but a little.
Ishtar, goddess of love, seven times seven I bow to thee.
¶ On the great wall.
¶ The Prince, Belshazzar, son of Nabonidus, apostle of tolerance and religious freedom. Replica of Babylon's encircling walls, 300 feet in height, and broad enough for the passing of chariots. Note: ...
The two-sword man, Belshazzar's faithful guard, a mighty man of valor.
The jealous priest of Bel sees in the enthronement of Ishtar loss of his religious power.
The gate of Imgur Bel which no enemy has ever been able to force.
Hand maidens from Ishtar's Temple of Love and Laughter.
The Princess Beloved, favorite of Belshazzar, in a room of scented cedar, plated with pure gold, in the hareem of My Lord the Prince.
¶ A love blossom from Belshazzar.
¶ Stricken by her pale beauty, as though by white lightning.
The brother of the Mountain Girl, having some slight trouble with his high-spirited sister, takes the matter to the court.
The first known court of justice in the world.
Note: ... Babylonian justice according to the code of Hammurabi, protecting the weak from the strong.
The Mountain Girl's brother tells the Judge that she is incorrigible.
The judgment is that she be sent to the marriage market to get a good husband.
Endlessly rocks the cradle uniter of here and hereafter. Chanter of sorrows and joys.
¶ Resuming our story of today.
¶ Dividends of the Jenkins mills failing to meet the increasing demands of Miss Jenkins' charities, she complains to her brother, which helps decide him to action.
Order a ten percent cut in all wages.
A great strike follows. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
They squeeze the money out of us and use it to advertise themselves by reforming us. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
Hungry ones that wait to take their places. ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ
Clear the property. The Loom of Fate weaves death for the Boy's father.
The exodus after a time of waiting.
Forced to seek employment elsewhere, many victims of the Jenkins' aspirations go to the great city nearby...the Boy among them.
So too, the Dear One...and her father.
Fate leads them all to the same district.
Adversity causes the friendless one to listen to a Musketeer of the Slums.
And again in Babylon.
¶ The marriage market.
¶ Money paid for beautiful women given to homely ones, as dowers, so that all may have husbands and be happy.
Lips brilliant with juice of henna; eyes lined with kohl.
Note: ... According to Herodotus, women corresponding to our street outcasts, for life the wards of Church and State.
The auctioneer.
Tish tish!
'tis no place to eat onions.

¶ In Babylon. ¶ The High Priest of Bel courts public homage.
The Priest of Bel, frenzied at the worship of Ishtar, prophecies the loss of their souls and the downfall of Babylon.
Belshazzar's father has a red letter day.
He excavates a foundation brick of the temple of Naram-Sin, builded 3200 years before.
Like other Mesopotamian kings, Naram Sin made stone statues to commemorate his military victories, this statue is now kept in the Louvre Museum in Paris.
Incidentally he remarks that Cyrus, the Persian, Babylon's mighty foe, is nearing the city.
We will begin building your city, oh dove of Ishtar, when Cyrus is conquered.

In another bitter day, memorable through intolerance.
The threatening attitude of the Huguenots throughout France is reported to Catherine.
The "old serpent" uses the incident to inflame the minds of the Catholics against the Protestants.
Remember, gentlemen, the Michelade at Nimes when hundreds of our faith perished at the hands of the Huguenots!
And so, our very lives depend upon their extermination.

Great timbers against the towers.

ـــــــــــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــــــــــ
In this last act the events portrayed in Babylon are according to the recently excavated ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ cylinders of Nabonidus and Cyrus, that relate Babylon's betrayal by the priests of Bel.
ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
These cylinders describe the greatest treason of all history, by which a civilization of countless ages was destroyed, and a universal written language (the cuneiform) was made to become an unknown cypher on the face of the earth.
The Cyrus Cylinder is a cuneiform inscription that Cyrus the Great ordered to be made during the conquest of Babylon.
In our modern story, The Musketeer, inflamed by a new face wins the unsuspecting little mother's confidence with a promise to recover her baby.

The High Priest looks down upon the city he seeks to betray to Cyrus.
They give thanks to Ishtar now, but Oh Lord Bel...tomorrow Cyrus, ـــــــــ ـــــــــ thy servant, shall avenge thee!
The Rhapsode, unaware of the dastardly purpose, is ordered by the High Priest to have chariots at the great gate for a journey to Cyrus.
In the tenement district, a simpler repast ...her last in Babylon.
At the table of Egibi, Babylonia's greatest noble. Note: ...
Following Babylonian custom, the feasting lasts many days.
Spiced wine, made cool with snow from the mountains.
Soldiers, barbarians and camp followers.
The Rhapsode, having completed his arrangements for the journey, turns to thoughts of love.
Thinking only of Belshazzar, her hero, The Mountain Girl leads on the love-sick boy, until  ...as always since the beginning of time between man and maid, boasting, he tells everything he knows.
I know not why we go, but if I don't return soon you can use the password to visit me.

In his distant camp, Cyrus awaits the priests.
The Mountain Girl's bold pursuit.
The day before the Boy's execution.
Feeling the Boy wrongly convicted by some mischance of fate, the Kindly Heart sees a ray of hope in the visit of the governor to the city.
And wondered if each one of us Would end the self-same way, ـــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــ
For none can tell to what red Hell His sightless soul may stray. ـــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــ
The governor unable to give any hope. ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ
At the tents of Cyrus.
The Mountain Girl from a distance watches the priests' arrival.
The great conspiracy.
¶ The Boy's last dawn. ¶ The hangman's test. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
Desperate, the little wife herself goes to the governor. ـــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــ
Oh God, don't let them do it! ـــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــ
¶ St. Bartholomew's morn. ¶ The bell of St. Germain.
The beginning of the massacre of St. Bartholomew.
For Brown Eyes, a terrible awakening.
The Dear One's appeal to the Governor fruitless. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
The Governor leaves. ـــــــــــ ـــــــــــ
I killed him!
I did it, I did it!

Babylon's last Bacchanal.
Brown eyes...ah me, ah me!
Cyrus unites forces with his lieutenant, Gobryas.
The Mountain Girl's warning delayed by the revelers.
A new appeal.
While Belshazzar doubts, the army of Cyrus enters through the gates left open by the priests.
Belshazzar at last convinced by his own servants.
Belshazzar finds only twelve guards to defend his palace gates against the hordes of Cyrus.
The Princess' vain appeal.
To save Belshazzar the disgrace of captivity, they send him back to his throne.
¶ At the threshold of death. ¶ The farewell.
Honor commands that you go with your king to the death halls of Allat.
To God the glory!
Long live Cyrus, King of Kings and Lord of Lords!
When cannon and prison bars wrought in the fires of intolerance...
And perfect love shall bring peace forevermore.
Instead of prison walls... Bloom flowery fields.

SOMNAMBULISM A Collection from Uppsala University. Published in 1726.
"His specialty."
The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. In the year of 1703, a mystic by the name of Caligari toured the fairs of numerous villages in northern Italy, accompanied by a somnambulist named Cesare...
For month he sowed panic amongst village folks through a series of foul murders committed under almost identical circumstances.
He had entirely subjugated to his mill a somnambulist named Cesare, whom he did compel to carry out his nefarious schemes.
A puppet, the exact likeness of Cesare, and which took his place in a cabinet, allowed him to divert any suspicion that might fall on the somnambulist.

English translation by Robert Gray (Kinograph)
Once there was a poor Salvation Army sister at death's door.
She was stricken with galloping consumption, and she had only held out for the space of a year.
When there was no hope left she had gone home to her mother.
Waiting at the foot of her bed was another Salvation Army sister who had once worked alongside the sick girl.
"Don't fret over those poor souls now, Sister Edit."
"You have done enough for them."
"Send for David Holm!"
"Please don't!
My daughter was yours as long as she had a spark of life."
"Let me have her to myself now that she is dying."
"Slster Maria, why don't you do as I ask?
Send for David Holm!"
"l shall go fetch him at once."
"You can't be serious, asking David Holm to attend a death bed?"
"l haven't been able to find him, but Gustavsson is looking too." "He will bring him here if that is at all possible."
"Poor Mrs Holm Poor Mrs Holm"
"l'll take her back home."
"lt wouldn't do for her husband to see her should he come."
The evening on which these events took place was not an ordinary one.
It was New Year's Eve.
"Well, we will certainly know when it's time to toast the New Year!"
"lt's a spooky place to await midnight, here among the dead."
"You gentlemen are not afraid of ghosts, I hope?"
"Then I'd like to tell you a story while we wait for the midnight hour."
"l once had a pal called Georges, who was generally a jolly fellow."
"He came of a good family, and had studied hard at Uppsala University, so he knew a bit more than the rest of us."
"But a change would come over him on New Year's Eve."
"Remember that it's New Year's Eve, the last day of the year!"
"Whoever dies on this eve must drive the cart of death."
"There is an old, old cart..."
no ordinary driver holds the reigns." "He is in the service of a strict master named Death."
"For him, a single night is as long as 100 years on Earth." "Night and day he must carry out his master's business."

"Wherever he goes, he is greeted with sorrow and despair."
"There is no escape He must perform his sorry duty."
"Although the horse and cart remain the same, the driver will vary."
"The last soul to die each year, the one who gives up the ghost at the stroke of midnight, is destined to be Death's driver during the coming year."
"Now you know why i'm afraid of something fatal happening on New Year's Eve."
"And the odd thing is, you see, that Georges apparently died last New Year's Eve."
"Why hasn't Gustavsson arrived with David Holm?"
"Come with me, David Holm"
"Sister Edit is dying and she has asked for you."
"lf Sister Edit wants to see you, you must go at once!"
"David, I can't believe it's you!
You are meant to relieve me!"
"You ought to lift me up ln your cart and take me to the hospital."
"No living soul rides ln this cart." "By the time I arrive it is too late for a doctor."
"You know well enough that I am no longer alive."
"But, worst of all, you must face the consequences of the evil you have wrought during your lifetime."
"David, do you think i'm unaware that it is my fault you have met such an end?"
"lf you hadn't fallen in with me you would have led a good life with your wife, children and brother."
"By tomorrow you will have served your time for drunken behaviour."
"But before you leave, a harsher punishment awaits you."
"Behold, your brother." "While you were here he killed a man while intoxicated, and now a long prison term awaits."
"But we feel that you ought to serve the sentence instead, since you and you alone led him astray, and made him a killer."
"Does this not make you turn from your wicked ways, David Holm?"
"Yes, for only now do I realise how it feels to have brought great misery upon a loved one."
"What about your wife and children?"
"l know how miserable they felt, but I will turn over a new leaf."
End of Part ll
The Phantom Carriage Part lll
"No, she is not ill."
"She was well enough the other day, when she left."
"And here I was thinking I would come home to her with such joy!"
"lf she had gone openly,
I would have understood, but to slink off like that, to let me come home to an empty house, that was heartless!"
"l'll wipe those smiles off your faces."
"l'll find her, and I'll teach her how it feels when your heart freezes to its very core, like mine has!"
"l'll refrain from reminding you of your search for your wife, during which your feelings of hatred and revenge waxed stronger."
"l will take you to a time a year ago, to last New Year's Eve, when you came here, bringing such misfortune in your wake."
"A Salvation Army station had been set up here in town." "And it was ready for use on New Year's Eve."
"Keep your food!
I only want to sleep."
"Leave it be!
It may be full of germs!" "We don't have the sterilising oven going yet."
"Don't you realise, Maria, how it pleases me to help the first guest God sent us?"
"Please, go to bed. lt's been a busy day." "Let me attend to this."
"Dear Jesus, let our first guest be blessed with a happy year."
All night long she bent over the coat, never giving thought to the germs she had inhaled."
"By the time she went to bed the chill of winter had thoroughly penetrated the room."
"Did you mend my coat?"
"Would you mind fetching the person who did this?"
"lt's a shame you went to all that trouble, Miss, but i'm used to having it like this."
"Before you leave, I'd like to ask you to visit me next New Year's Eve."
"You see, I prayed that our first guest would have a good year." "And I wanted to find out if my prayers were answered."
"Oh, I'll be here."
"l'll come to show you God didn't give a fig for you or your twaddle."
"The time has come to honour that promise before you take over here."
"From you she contracted the disease that ends her life, and now she awaits your visit."
"You have possessed all that is most wonderful, but you have lost it!"
"You cannot avoid the torment or remorse, just as you cannot escape taking over as Death's driver for a year."

"lt is Death, but too soon."
"You see that i'm not afraid of you." "l will gladly heed your summons, but grant me a day's grace, for there is someone I must talk sense into."

"l must tell you that the person i'm waiting for is the man I love. "Do you understand?
The man I love!"
"l would grant you grace if it would avail you, but you have no power over this man."
"You have tried to make him mend his ways, believing he was good, but your hopes have been dashed time and time again."

"l'm a consumptive, but I cough into people's faces in the hope of finishing them off."
"Why should they be better than us?"
"He's merely amusing himself. He's not as wicked as he pretends to be."
"How can you be filled with such bitter hatred for your fellow man?"
"You needn't worry about that. I'll be leaving town in a few days."
"No, you mustn't do that!"
"l would rather you stayed so I may challenge you again."
"However tempting that maybe, I still can't stay."
"You see, little missy, i'm on a journey throughout Sweden, in search of a person I must find at all costs."
"Who ls this person you seek?"
"You'll know that when I find the person in question"
"l am the one David Holm is looking for."
"l am his wife."
"l couldn't endure the life he led." "I deserted him, took my children and crept away in secret."
"l moved to this town for it was so far from our old home, that I never expected him to come looking for me here."
"You must take him back!
It's his only hope!"
"l didn't mean that you must make up your mind on the spot, but promise me to listen to your heart, and we can talk again."
She had got the better of herself and asked for none of the things that belonged to this world.
"Just come with me!
A surprise awaits that will make you happy."

She wanted to replant the seed that had fallen among the thorns, and she may well have gained her end had it not been that...
"The doctor says it's pneumonia." "Her resistance is so poor for she has had ill health ever since last New Year's Eve."
"Yes, this David Holm has been her undoing."
"She worries so about the situation between him and his wife, but she mustn't know the truth."
"You might at least have the heart to spare the children from infection!"
"lt wasn't as easy to run away this time!"
"Haven't you had enough revenge?"
"lf only I hadn't brought them together again!"
"His sin would be of less magnitude if not for me."
"You must grant me grace!
I cannot die yet!"
"l must see him turn over a new leaf!
. Just spare me a few minutes!"
"You know I love him.
I've never loved him as I do today."
"Captive, ye of loving heart, take leave of thy prison."
"Come along.
There ls nothing for us to do here." "Those who are to receive her will arrive shortly."
"You know, David, if I could send a message to humankind, "l would like to send them a New Year's greeting."
"l would like them to dwell on a single New Year's prayer."
"Lord, please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped."
"Why are we here?
Surely no one here is going to die!"
"No, I can't go on. I can't go on!"
"l'm sorry, but I must go away, and I cannot leave them behind."
"Please don't be angry with me.
It's not my fault."
"This will do, David. It will suffice for the children and myself."
"Yes, David, I see what's coming."

"Don't let those poor, innocent creatures die!"

"Sentence me to eternal night!"
"Let nothing remain of me!"
"Do what you like to me, my Lord, only spare the three of them!"
"David, I see that I no longer need to grieve for you!"
"Sister Edit is dead, and I have been at her side."
"You're lying!
"No one believes I want to reform."
"lt's hard to believe, David."
"l can't help crying too."
"Lord, please let my soul come to maturity before it ls reaped."

Dedicated to the German People
KRIEMHILD'S REVENGE
The First Canto:
How Kriemhild Mourned Siegfried, and How König Etzel (King Attila) Courted Her
Through Rüdiger von Bechlarn.
King Gunther, Margrave Rüdiger von Bechlarn asks for an audience!
I come as ambassador to King Attila. He who is called the Lord of the Earth -
He who seeks the hand of your sister Kriemhild in marriage.
I am afraid King Attila knows not whom he woos.
In the name of Siegfried, who was murdered and whose murderer lives!
Keep in mind how Siegfried died!
Lord Attila sends me, O Queen, to ask for your hand on his behalf!
You seem to know quite well, Rüdiger, that I have been exposed to grievous wrongs in the house of my clan!
Brother!
Where is your brother Siegfried?
Deliver unto me the murderer of my husband, O King!
He has remained loyal to me; so shall I remain loyal to him.
This, Kriemhild, is my final word!
Lady Kriemhild, Margrave Rüdiger, wishes to speak with you after evensong!
Now, Gerenot, is the time to keep close watch over Burgundy!
Speak to me of Lord Attila, Rüdiger!
You court a dead woman, Rüdiger!
He who murdered my husband flaunts the greensparkling sword that he stole from the dead man.
If ever you were done wrong at Attila's court, my lady, - Lord Attila would know how to avenge you!
Lord Margrave, swear this unto me in your and in King Attila's names!
Not on the cross, Lord Margrave, - on the sharp edge of your sword!
My lady!
Lord Hagen has stolen the Treasure!
You have my word, Lord Margrave Rüdiger!
Hagen Tronje, where is the Treasure?
Thus spake loyal Hagen:
Somewhere, my lady, where no-one might use the gold to forge arms against the kings of Burgundy!
Thus ends the First Canto.
The Second Canto:
How Kriemhild Fled Her Homeland, and How She Was Received by Lord Attila.
You have drunk Siegfried's blood, O Earth!
One day I shall drench you with Hagen Tronje's blood!
I shall return!
Rest assured, I shall return!
My daughter, shall you not proffer your hand in farewell to your brother Gunther?
No, mother.
You are heading far away, Lady Kriemhild. Don't you want to make peace with your family first?
No, my priest.
Don't you even once want to hail your people, my lady?
No, Rüdiger.
As Kriemhild approached, springtime blossomed in the land of the Huns.
That sack full of gold is mine!
The queen is coming!
Meet her, brother!
Royal jewellery!
My lady, King Attila's brother, Blaodel, gives thee welcome!
Choose for yourself a kingdom from my lands, Rüdiger, in gratitude for this woman!
Ask King Attila, Margrave Rüdiger, whether he is prepared to make your oath his own!
Upon my oath, O Queen:
any man who insults you or does you wrong shall die a hundredfold death!
Thus ends the Second Canto.
The Third Canto:
How King Attila Besieged Rome and How Kriemhild Summoned Her Brothers.
Lord Attila swore he wanted to turn Rome's churches into stables for our horses!
Why does Lord Attila no longer uphold his oath?
We traipsed headlong into war!
Why don't we ride further onward?
Why is Lord Attila's horse tethered to his tent?
A great horseman was King Attila!
A mighty mare for him was the world!
Lord Attila whipped the world - his mare!
What does Lord Attila do now?
He sleeps!
He sleeps!
Lord Attila, Attila sleeps!
This white woman has stolen Attila from underneath our noses!
With her tresses does she bind up the horseman, The great horseman, Lord Attila!
This white woman has stolen Attila from underneath our noses!
With her tresses does she bind up the horseman, The great horseman, Lord Attila!
My lord -!
Kriemhild...
My lord -!
Kriemhild has borne you a son!
O Earth... sacred Earth...
One wish, O Queen!
One wish that I might fulfill for you!
If you would honour me and make me happy, Lord Attila, then summon my brothers as guests to your court!
To Worms, Blaodel, to request as guests to our court the royal brothers of my wife!
Thus ends the Third Canto.
The Fourth Canto:
How Kriemhild Received Her Brothers.
For more than one moon's time your brothers stayed as guests of Rüdiger in the house of Bechlarn.
The minstrels sing a new song of the love between your brother Giselher and Rüdiger's only child, the beautiful Dietlind!
And so I bind in faith -
Bechlarn and Burgundy: one heart, one life, one death!
To honour your brothers,
Lord Attila has sent the noblest of his knights - Dietrich von Bern - to greet them.
Once more, Nibelungen, before Lord Attila comes to greet you:
How could we forget, my lord, that we come to visit our sister Kriemhild?
Whoever wants to win my gratitude shall bear my sorrow in mind!
It was the day of the summer solstice, and the Nibelungen arrived at Attila's court.
King Attila, I now exhort you to your oath!
Siegfried's murderer is in your hands!
Think upon my sorrow!
Will you never forget Lord Siegfried, my lady?
Hagen Tronje shall fight me for his life!
You mustn't fight with the murderer, Attila!
You must have the murderer killed!
Have our guest killed?
You swore to me, Attila!
On the life of your child: Make good upon your oath!
I hail from a desert land, O Queen.
If only one thing is sacred, it is a guest!
So long as Hagen Tronje regards the peace of my house, he shall be left in peace!
She spoke:
Whoever wants to win my gratitude shall bear my sorrow in mind!
Whoever brings me the head of Tronje, I shall fill his shield with gold!
But I beseech you: do no harm to the sons of my mother!
Play on, bard!
Thus ends the Fourth Canto.
The Fifth Canto:
How the Huns Celebrated the Summer Solstice with the Nibelungen.
Is it the fashion at Worms upon the Rhine to sit at table armed from head to foot?
Lord Hagen Tronje knows why he never lays aside his sword!
Methinks that at such a feast the heir to all Attila's crowns mustn't be absent!
Methinks the boy will not live long.
Scarcely shall we as guests attend any court of his!
Treason!
The child!
The work of your guest, Lord Attila!
Now, Nibelungen, you are fair game!
I demand safe conduct from this hall for myself and my men!
Thus ends the Fifth Canto.
The Sixth Canto:
The Nibelungen's Distress.
Alert Lady Kriemhild of what it is you see!
Open the gate!
No Hun survives any longer in Attila's hall!
Avenge thy dead, Huns!
O Queen, it is impossible!
Avenge thy dead, Huns, and the royal child!
Sister!
Sister!
Consider your mother!
Hand over Siegfried's murderer - and you shall be free!
The fight is too uneven!
Not one of the Nibelungen will gaze upon this next dawn.
In Giselher does my own child die!
Stay out of it, Rüdiger!
Blood shall follow blood!
Get me Rüdiger!
The time is nigh, Lord Rüdiger!
Make good upon your oath!
Lord Margrave Rüdiger, I demand from you Siegfried's murderer!
You do not send me against Hagen Tronje,
- you send me against your brothers, my lady, who defend him with their very lives!
You've sworn an oath, Rüdiger!
You've sworn it upon the sharp edge of your sword!
I engaged my only child to Giselher!
Blood shall follow blood, Lord Rüdiger!
My lord! Do not force me to kill my only child!
Thus ends the Sixth Canto.
The Seventh Canto:
The Nibelungen's End.
Lord Rüdiger stands before the gate!
He will bring us peace!
What do you bring us, father?
Death!
My lord, do not allow they who love one another to kill one another!
Tell them:
They must deliver unto me the murderer of my child - and they are free!
You know not the German soul, Lord Attila!
The oath I made to Kriemhild is older than the oath between myself and you!
Don't force me to break my oath!
Do you wish me to lose my honour? !
- Defend yourself, Hagen Tronje!
O sister, what you have wrought!
Deliver Hagen unto me - and you are free!
Exalt in your revenge, Kriemhild!
Your younger brother is dead!
Rüdiger and his men are dead!
But Hagen Tronje lives on, who slew your Siegfried!
Hurl fire into the hall!
My lord!
The Queen bids the hall be bombarded with fire arrows!
The palace is burning!
Lady Kriemhild is right, she is more than right!
I myself will stand at her side as the fire flushes the murderer Hagen from his hole!
You have my thanks, Kriemhild!
Although we were never united in love, we will, in the end, yet be united in hate!
Never, King Attila, was my heart so filled with love as now!
I don't want King Gunther of Burgundy to die a smoky death!
I shall offer Lady Kriemhild my head!
Speak, ye Nibelungen, will you buy your lives with Hagen Tronje's head? !
Loyalty, unbroken by iron, also will not melt in fire, Hagen Tronje!
Look!
Volker prepares his fiddle for one final song!
I call it a shame and a disgrace,
Lady Kriemhild, that you let these heroes whom you could not defeat in battle be annihilated in fiery distress!
Do you hear? Lord Volker is singing!
O, that we were on the cool, green Rhine!
Do you hear? Lord Volker is singing!
You are no human being, Lady Kriemhild -!
No!
I died when Siegfried died...
An end -!
An end -!
One vassal still lives, Lord Attila!
I cannot go home to my dead Siegfried before having atoned for every wrong...
Here is the sword, Lord Hagen. Where is the Treasure?
I swore never to betray the location of the Treasure so long as one of my kings still lives!
Now, Kriemhild, no-one knows anything of the Treasure other than God and myself!
And God is no more discreet than I!
Now, Earth, drink your fill!
Deliver her home to Siegfried, her dead husband!
She belonged to no other man!
Here does the myth have an end.

Dedicated to the German People
Siegfried
Canto I
How Siegfried slayed the dragon
Thus spoke Mime, the artful blacksmith: "Siegfried, son of King Siegmund, ride home to Xanten.
Have you never before heard of the king's castle at Worms on the Rhine and the kings of Burgundy who reign there?
I shall go there towing Kriemhild!
Show me the way to Worms or you will lose your life!
Farewell, Siegfried, son of king Siegmund. You will never get to Worms!
Young Siegfried understood the bird's song:
If the dragon slayer would bathe in the dragon's blood, his body would become invincible, forever safe against sword and spear!
Here ends the first Canto
Canto II
Now Volker, the bard, sang of Siegfried in front of Kriemhild, and how Siegfried came to Worms.
The violin sounded and Volker sang:
The dragon slayer, the son of Siegmund entered the realm of the Nibelungen.
He won the fight against the dragon. There is no one on earth like him.
Thus spoke Alberich, the Nibelung: Spare my life and I will give you the wonder cap.
Whoever wears it becomes unseen or may take whatever form he chooses!
Spare my life, O hero, and I will make you the richest king on earth!
The crown of the King of the Northland, the ruler of the Ice giants is being wrought here by the Nibelungen.
No sword on earth compares with Balmung. The Nibelungen forged it in fire of blood.
All is lost. Cursed be the heritage of the heir! Return with me to stone all ye whom from stone were wrought.
The violin sounded and Volker sang:
Siegfried became the dragon slayer The lord of the Nibelungen Treasure.
Twelve kingdoms subdued the powerful. Twelve kings became his vassals.
Kriemhild, the daughter of Ute: "Volker, take this cloak, as reward for your song!
I embroidered it myself.
Siegfried, son of King Sigmund, is outside the castle door with twelve of his knights, and asks for an audience with King Gunther.
Thus spake Hagen Tronje:
King Gunther, let the dragon slayer go his ways, don't welcome him here!
No one shall say that at Worms one does not know the way kings greet each other!
Siegfried, son of King Siegmund, has my welcome!
I dreamt last night an awful dream...
And now this dream comes to my mind!
I come, King Gunther, to ask for your sister Kriemhild's hand.
King Gunther, too, has marriage plans. He has set his heart on a bold and mighty maiden.
Her name is Brunhild and she is Queen of Iceland.
Ringed by fire, her invincible castle towers in the Northland.
Why must you speak of Brunhild?
You know she has set dangerous conditions: Thrice must the suitor best her in feats of strength or die!
Siegfried, the unique hero, has come to Worms at an opportune moment.
He may help us win Brunhild for you!
Twelve kings have I for vassals. But vassal am I to no man, now and ever!
Prepare for the quest to get your bride, King Gunther. It is Siegfried the mighty hero who will win Brunhild for you.
Here ends the second Canto.
Canto III:
How Siegfried won Brunhild for Gunther
The dragon ship is carrying foreign heroes to your shores!
The foreigners are nearing the flaming sea.
If he be strong enough and favored by the gods, the flames will consume themselves and die.
My maidens, help me put on my armor, this will be a fight I've never fought before!
Welcome, hero, for the fight for life or death!
Neither life nor death do I desire from you, Brunhild.
It is King Gunther who woos you!
Before it is evening, King Gunther, your smothered weapons will adorn my hall.
Give me leave, King Gunther, to make ready your ship for Bronhild, your royal bride.
We should set sail for home before sundown!
Let the triple battle begin, King Gunther!
You have to defeat me three times, king: with the stone, the spring, and the spear.
Fear not, king! Make you the motions and my strength will win each contest. I'll throw the stone for you and carry you in the jump.
Here ends the third Canto
Canto IV
How Brunhild enters Worms and how the kings celebrated their wedding.
Start the prepartions for marriage! The king's ship is arriving!
We have reached our destination, my queen!
Are you really the man who defeated me threefold?
I am your captive, but I shall never be your wife!
Keep your word, King Gunther, as I have kept mine!
If Kriemhild gives her consent, hero, we shall celebrate a double wedding here today.
Since when is it customary among Burgundians to give the King's daughter in marriage to a vassal?
Siegfried is no vassal. I love him as though he were my brother. We shall become blood brothers today!
Blood is mingling with red blood, the drops fuse inseparably.
Whoever forsakes loyalty to the bloodbrother will perish at the wayside, all honor is lost!
Brunhild has been defeated, not cowed.
Shall the king of Burgundy be scorned by an obstinate woman?
Damned be the deed half done! Will you forsake your friend who gave you his own sister?
The magic cap will change you into what you wish. Take Gunther's form and break Brunhild's iron will.
Here ends the fourth Canto
Canto V
How, after half a year, Siegfried's gift to his bride, the Nibelungen Treasure, arrives in Worms and how the two queens quarrel with each other.
O king, Burgundy's glory is waning, we need the Nibelungen treasure.
It would be folly to reject what Siegfried offers you as a brother and Kriemhild is worth more than all the gold in the world!
See what I found!
Put away the armlet, Kriemhild, it guards an ugly secret.
The Mistress of the Nibelungen Treasure has no need for it!
Listen, Kriemhild, at how I won the armlet - and keep silent!
The Nibelungen treasure has arrived!
How long, King Gunther, will Siegfried and Kriemhild tarry at the court of Burgundy?
They stay for the sake of my mother.
Would you, Brunhild, be willing to take up the daughter's place for Queen Ute?
Your brother's honor is entwined with this armlet. It never should be seen again by human eyes!
It seems to me high time, King Gunther, that you send Siegfried back home to Xanten!
Never! He shall leave of his own freewill!
I am going to attend mass, my daughter.
Follow me soon!
I'll go to the cathedral in the regalia of the queen of Burgundy!
The wife of a vassal may not precede the Queen of Burgundy!
How did you dare refer to Siegfried, my husband?
Siegfried introduced himself to me as Gunther's vassal and servant. He did servant's work for my husband!
You, whom he disdained. You, whom he gave away. You dare to belittle Siegfried?
Make way for the Queen of Burgundy, vassal woman!
You recognize this armlet, you queen of Burgundy?
How came that armlet into your hand?
The carrier of the magic helmet who, disguised as Gunther, defeated you three times - Siegfried, my husband gave it to me!
King! Speaks your sister the truth?
Kill Siegfried!
Kill Siegfried!
Your babbling, hero, was worse than murder!
Kill Siegfried!
Siegfried is safe from your wrath. None can slay the dragon slayer!
Save in one spot, where the linden leaf clung, is he vulnerable as other men!
King Gunther, let me deal with the dragon slayer!
We pledged blood brotherhood. How can I be party to his death?
The one who took the armlet from me made me his wife, took my maidenhood from me!
Tronje, announce to the people of Burgundy that I invite everybody to a royal hunt to kill a mad dog and a ravening.
Here ends the fifth Canto.
Canto VI
How Gunther betrayed Siegfried.
Can you keep a secret Kriemhild?
I once broke the oath to be silent and never will do so again!
Well then, the upcoming hunt might easily turn into a chase for men.
A secret message warns me of war against Burgundy!
Good for you, Kriemhild, that your husband is the dragon slayer, the invincible!
Who warrants me that in the heat of battle not a chance blade should pierce where the lime leaf fell?
If you want me to protect him, I have to know the exact spot where the invicible could be hurt!
You are good counsel, you truest of true.
I shall mark the spot with a little cross myself!
I come to take leave, Brunhild. We are starting for the hunt in the Odenwald forest.
Mind my vow, King Gunther, I shall not eat nor drink until my disgrace has been vindicated!
O my dear lord, don't leave me. I dreamt last night a furious boar tore you to pieces!
O my dear lord, don't leave me. I dreamt further that two mountains collapsed and buried you!
Today Gunther and I will reconcile. Who else is my enemy?
Mother, I feel as if blood is draining from my heart!
The hunt in the Odenwald forest lasted from morning until sundown.
A handful of red gold for a cooling draught of white wine!
A wheel broke from the wagon loaded with wine. But I know of a cool brook nearby!
I always heard of you as the fastest runner of all heroes, let's run, you and I, for the first draught!
Gunther, my brother, let's be friends again!
When you are back from the spring!
Grim Hagen spoke:
The hunt is over!"
Here ends the sixth Canto.
Canto VII
How Kriemhild swears revenge to Hagen Tronje
You may break your fast, Brumhild, Siegfried is dead.
Hail to you King Gunther! For the sake of a woman's lie, you have slain your most loyal friend!
I call to you for justice, King Gunther! Hagen Tronje has slain my husband!
Loyalty for loyalty, Kriemhild.
His deed is ours.
His fate is ours.
Our breast is his shield.
You might try to hide among my clan, behind the altars of God, or at the end of the world
- You cannot escape my vengeance, Hagen Tronje!
Announce to King Gunther, my brother, the Queen of Burgundy is dead!
Thus ends the tale of Siegfried.

Part one.
"MEN AND MAGGOTS."
The spirit of revolution soared over the Russian land.
A tremendous, mysterious process was taking place in countless hearts.
The individual personality, having hardly had time to become conscious of itself... dissolved in the mass, and the mass itself became dissolved in the revolutionary élan.
Sailors Matyushenko and Vakulinchuk.
We, the sailors of Potemkin, must support the workers, our brothers... and stand among the front lines of the revolution!
Heavy and gloomy is the sleep of the off duty.
Attentive, but clumsy.
He vents his anger on a young man.
Hurtful...
Vakulinchuk
Comrades!
The time has come when we too must speak out.
Why wait?
All of Russia has risen!
Are we to be the last?
Morning.
We've had enough rotten meat!
Even a dog wouldn't eat this!
The ship doctor Smirnov.
It could crawl overboard on its own!
These aren't worms.
They are dead fly larvae. You can wash them off with brine!
Russian prisoners in Japan are fed better than we are!
We've had enough rotten meat!
It's good meat. End of discussion!
Senior Officer Giliarovsky
Impotent rage was overflowing.
The ship's store.
The sailors refused to eat the borscht.
GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD
Part two. "DRAMA ON THE DECK."
Commander Golikov
Whoever is satisfied with the borscht take two steps forward!
The petty officers.
You're free to go!
I'll hang the rest on the yard!
Call the guards!
Matyushenko, under the guise of breaking ranks, calls the sailors to the gun turret.
To the turret...
To the turret!
To the turret...
Guys! ...
It's time.
Most of them gathered by the turret.
Stop!
Don't move!
They try to sneak through the admiral's hatch.
Back, scoundrels!
That way is not for you!
I'll shoot you all like dogs!
Cover them with canvas!
Got it!
Cover them!
Attention!
Dear Lord!
Make the disobedient see reason!
Fire right into the canvas!
Vakulinchuk decides.
Fire!
BROTHERS!
Who are you shooting at?
!
The rifles quavered.
Shoot!
Everyone shoot!
Shoot, scum!
To the rifles, brothers!
Smash the dragons!
Smash 'em!
Smash 'em all!
Have fear of God!
Beat it, sorcerer!
To the bottom to feed the worms!
Brothers!
We've won!
The bleeding Vakulinchuk flees from the furious Giliarovsky.
Vakulinchuk's overboard!
Save Vakulinchuk!
And he who was first to sound the cry of rebellion was first to fall at the executioner's hand.
To the shore.
Odessa.
A tent on the new pier in Odessa is the final resting place for Vakulinchuk.
FOR A SPOONFUL OF BORSCHT
Part three. "THE DEAD MAN CALLS OUT."
Mist lingered on from the night...
Rumours came from the pier.
Together with the sun, the news hit the city.
The battleship raided rebellion shore...
A killed sailor...
We'll remember.
For a spoonful of borscht.
"Citizens of Odessa!
Lying before you is the body of the brutally killed sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk... killed by a senior officer of the squadron battleship Prince Tavrichesky.
Let's take revenge on the bloodthirsty vampires!
Death to the oppressors!
Signed: Crew of the squadron battleship Prince Tavrichesky."
Eternal memory to the fallen fighters!
All for one.
One for all.
Down with the executioners!
Down with tyranny!
Mothers and brothers!
Let there not be differences or hostility among us!
Smash the Jews!
Shoulder to shoulder.
The land is ours.
Tomorrow is ours.
A delegate from shore.
The enemy must be dealt a decisive blow!
Together with the rebelling workers from all of Russia
WE WILL WIN!
The shore watched Potemkin tensely and attentively.
Part four. "THE ODESSA STAIRCASE."
In those memorable days, the city lived together with the rebellious battleship.
Like a white-winged flock, boats flew to the battleship.
AND SUDDENLY
Let's go!
Let's convince them!
Listen!
Don't shoot!
My boy is badly hurt.
COSSACKS!
And then the brutality of the military authorities in Odessa was answered with the battleship's shells.
The target - the Odessa theater.
The generals' headquarters.
Part five. "RENDEZVOUS WITH THE SQUADRON."
Turbulent meetings went on until evening.
The people of Odessa are waiting for the liberators!
Land the troops and the army will join you.
Landing is not possible. The admiral's squadron is coming our way.
With one heart, they decided to face the squadron.
Night came, full of anxiety.
The squadron was sneaking up in the darkness.
Sore from constant speech, throats breathe heavily and unevenly.
Squadron on the horizon!
All hands on deck!
Prepare for battle!
Full speed!
Hearts forward!
Top speed!
Potemkin and destroyer No. 267.
The admiral attacks!
The squadron draws near!
Give the signal: join us!
Join!
... ...us!
The enemy is within firing range!
All against one.
ONE AGAINST ALL.
... or...
BROTHERS!
Above the heads of the tsar's admirals thundered a brotherly hurrah.
And proudly waving the red flag of victory, without a single shot, the rebellious battleship passed through the rows of the squadron.

"GO WEST, YOUNG MAN, GO WEST" Horace Greeley (1811 – 1872)
Some people travel through life making friends where ever they go, while others -
Just travel through life.
In a little town in Indiana, the social standing of   a certain young man had kept him continuously on the move.
"I'll give you a dollar sixty five for the whole business."
"I've tried every place in town for a job, do you suppose there's any use asking you?"
Brown Eyes.
"Do you need any cowboys today?"
"I'm working here."
"You don't seem to be."
"Tell that new hand to get a horse and go help the boys."
"I'm shipping a thousand head, Thursday.
I can't hold out any longer."
"Get those steers back in there."
"Wave something red and they'll come to you."
"Get a brand on that cow."
The day of the shipment.
"What do you mean by selling cattle now,   when you know I am holding out for a higher price?"
"That's my business."
"You'll not ship cattle out of this country if I can stop it."
"He threatens to stop the cattle. -
- And if they don't reach the stockyards, I'm ruined."
"Put her in there, she goes too."
"Where?"
"To the slaughter-house."
"She's not going!"
"You can't buy her, she'll bring twice that much."
"Why don't you let him have her."
"You boys see that the train gets through."
"When you say that - SMILE."
Union Stock Yards, -
- Los Angeles, California.
When Empty Return this Car to
"-- and if they don't reach the stockyards, I'm ruined."
"Can you give me something red?"
"Captain, there's a thousand cattle roaming the streets!"
"There's five thousand steers outside!"
"There's ten thousand wild cows loose in the street!"
"There's a million bulls in town!"
"Call out the Fire Department to help stop the stampede."
"Arrest the man responsible for this."
UNION STOCK YARDS
"Have you seen anything of my cattle?"
"I guess we're through."
"My home and anything I have is yours for the asking."
"I want her."
The Western and Atlantic Flyer speeding into Marrietta, Ga., in the Spring 1861.
There were two loves in his live.
His engine, And--
"Fort Sumter has been fired upon."
"Then the war is here."
"Yes, dad, and I'm going to be one of the first to enlist."
"Aren't you going to enlist?"
"Your name?"
"Johnnie Gray."
"Occupation?"
"Engineer on the Western and Atlantic Railroad."
"Don't enlist him.
He is more valuable to the South as an engineer."
"We can't use you."
"William Brown."
"Occupation?"
"Bartender."
"If you lose this war don't blame me."
"Did Johnnie enlist?"
"He didn't even get in line."
"He's a disgrace to the South.
"Why didn't you enlist?"
"They wouldn't take me."
"Please don't lie.
I don't want you to speak to me again until you are in uniform.
A year later.
In a Union encampment just North of Chattanooga.
General Thatcher, and his chief spy, Captain Anderson.
"I Know every foot of this railroad from Marietta to Chattanooga, and with ten picked men I cannot fail."
"We will enter the South as civilians coming from the neutral state of Kentucky to join the southern cause."
"At Big Shanty we will steal the train while the passengers and the crew are at dinner, and proceeding North we will burn every bridge, cutting off the supplies of the army now facing you."
"Then the day you steal the train I will have General Parker advance to meet you."
"As soon as I arrive I will let you know how seriously father is wounded."
"Big Shanty. Twenty minutes for dinner."
"Three men stole my General.
I think they are deserters."
"Why not stop and fight them?"
"I'm afraid they have us greatly outnumbered."
The Southern army facing Chattanooga is ordered to retreat."
General Parker's victorious Northern army advancing.
In the enemy's country, hopelessly lost, helplessly cold and horribly hungry.
"At Nine o'clock tomorrow morning our supply trains will meet and unite with General Parker's army at the Rock River bridge."
"Then the army, backed by our supply trains, will advance for a surprise attack on the rebels left flank."
"Once our trains and troops cross that bridge, nothing on the earth can stop us."
"This girl was in the baggage car when we stole the train, so I thought it best to hold her."
"We had better stay here until daybreak to see where we are."
"It was so brave of you to risk your life, coming into the enemy's country, just to save me."
After a nice, quiet, refreshing night's rest.
"We've got to get back to our lines somehow and warn them of this coming attack."
"I will get that spy before he reaches the Southern lines.
You follow with the supply trains as planned."
"We must pick up more firewood."
The Rock River bridge.
The Northern division nearing the bridge to meet the supply trains.
"That bridge is not burned enough to stop you, and my men will ford the river."
Heroes of the day.
"Is that your uniform?"
"I had to wear it to get through the lines."
"Take it off!"
"Enlist the lieutenant."
"Occupation?"
"Soldier."
Soon after its premiere, the film Metropolis was severely truncated and alterations were made. From that time onward, more than a quarter of the film was assumed to have been lost. Then, in 2008, a virtually complete version of the film was discovered in Buenos Aires.
A considerable amount of the film reconstruction was able to be completed and the correct sequence of its editing established by means of this Argentinian material. Spanish intertitles have been translated into German with the aid of the censor-cards. In order to display in their correct position on the image the cropped elements taken from the 16mm negative, the missing portion of the frame has been marked by black.
The intertitles appear with their original graphic treatment. Those titles which appear in a different typeface (like the one used here) have been added to summarise the content of still-missing scenes as far as is necessary to facilitate an adequate understanding of the storyline. Shorter gaps are indicated by small segments of black leader.

Epigraph: THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART!
Shift change.
Deep beneath the earth lay the
City of the Workers.
As deep beneath the earth as the City of the Workers lay, so high above it towered the complex known as the "Sons' Club", with its lecture halls and libraries, its theatres and stadiums.
Fathers, for whom every revolution of a mechanical wheel meant gold, had bestowed upon their sons the wonder of the Eternal Gardens.
Which of you ladies shall today have the honour of entertaining Master Freder, Joh Fredersen's son?
Look! These are your brothers!
Look ― !
These are your brothers!
Who ― was that?
But this was what happened to Freder ― the son of Joh Fredersen, the master of Metropolis ― as he sought out the girl:
To the new Tower of Babel ― to my father ― !
Why is it, Josaphat, that I learn of this explosion from my son, and not from you ― !
Details ― !
What were you looking for in the Machine-Halls, Freder?
I wanted to look into the faces of the people whose little children are my brothers, my sisters...
Your magnificent city, Father ― and you the brain of this city ― and all of us within the light of this city... ―
...and where are the people, Father, whose hands built your city ― ?
Off where they belong off where they belong...?
...in the Depths...?
And if those in the Depths one day rise against you?
The chief foreman of the Heart-Machine, Grot, ― with an important message...
There were two more copies of those damnable plans, Herr Fredersen in the pockets of two men who met with an accident today at the M-Machine...
How is it, Josaphat, that these plans were brought to me by Grot, rather than by you?
Apply to the G-Bank for your remaining wages...
Father, do you know what it means to be dismissed by you? ― It means:
Do you know what it means to be dismissed like that by Joh Fredersen?
Would you like to come with me, Josaphat?
Go home, Josaphat, and wait for me... I still have a long way to go tonight...
Into the Depths, ― to my brothers...
From today on I wish to be kept precisely informed of my son's every move...
Brother the Machine!
There will be someone at the machine...
ME.
Listen to me... I want to trade my life with you...
Josaphat. 99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
Wait for me ― both of you...
Josaphat.
House 7, 7th Floor.
In the middle of Metropolis, there stands a strange house that the centuries had overlooked.
The man who dwelled within was Rotwang, the inventor.
Hel Born to bring me happiness and a benediction to all mankind. Lost to Joh Fredersen.
A mind like yours, Rotwang, should be able to forget...
Only one time in life did I forget something: that Hel was a woman ― and you a man...
Let the dead lie, Rotwang... She's dead for you as she is for me...
For me she isn't dead, Joh Fredersen ― for me she lives — !
Do you think the loss of a hand is too high a price for recreating Hel ― ? !
Do you wish to see her ― ? !
Now, Joh Fredersen ― ? ! Isn't it worth losing a hand to have created the man of the future ― the Machine-Man — ?
24 more hours of work ― and no man, Joh Fredersen, will be able to differentiate the Machine-Man from a mortal ― !
The woman is mine, Joh Fredersen! Hel's son was yours!
And what brings you my way, Joh Fredersen?
I need your advice ― as usual, when all my experts fail me...
Can you decipher for me these plans that for months have been getting discovered in the pockets of my workers?
...at two... once my shift ends! She has summoned us again...
Father ― ! Father ― ! Will ten hours never come to an end ― ?
― it's a blueprint of the two-thousand-year-old catacombs deep below the lowest levels of your Metropolis...
I should like to glean what my workers are doing exactly in those catacombs...
Today I shall tell you the legend of THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TOWER OF BABEL...
The Legend of THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TOWER OF BABEL
Come! Let us build a tower whose zenith shall reach unto the stars!
And at the tower's zenith we shall write: Great is the world and its Maker! And great is Man!
...but those who had conceived of the Tower of Babel could not build the Tower of Babel. The task was too great. So they paid wages to outside hands...
But the hands that built the Tower of Babel knew nothing of the dream of which the head that had conceived it had been fantasising.
The hymns of praise of one man became the curses of others.
The same language was spoken, but these men did not understand one another...
Great is the world and its Maker and great is Man
HEAD and HANDS require a Mediator.
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART!
And where is our Mediator, Maria ― ?
Wait for him! He will surely come!
We will wait, Maria...! But not for much longer ― !
Oh Mediator, have you finally come...
You summoned me ― here I am!
Rotwang, give the Machine-Man the likeness of this woman...
I shall sow discord between them and her! I shall destroy their belief in this woman ―
Leave me alone now, Joh Fredersen... You'll find the way back without me...
Now you shall also lose the last remaining thing you still had from Hel... your son...
Until tomorrow, in the cathedral!
END OF THE PRELUDE
INTERMEZZO
Freder witnesses a monk at the pulpit who preaches: "Verily, I say unto you: the days of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh!"
The monk's hand points to the Bible, in which it is written:
"And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, having a golden cup in her hand. And upon herforehead was a name written, a mystery:
You will annihilate Joh Fredersen ― him and his city and his son ― !
GLUTTONY
AVARICE
PRIDE
LUST
ENVY ANGER
SLOTH
Had you come earlier, you wouldn't have frightened me... I now beg of you: stay away from me and my beloved...!
Where is the one whose clothes you are wearing?
Josaphat. 99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
Would you please wake Georgy up? He must lead me to the Workers' City at once...
No. 11811, get back to the Machine and forget that you ever left it ― understood?
I have to have someone who's faithful to me, Josaphat, ― otherwise, how shall I attain the end-goal of my path ― ?
I must go on, Josaphat, ― must now, on my own, seek out the person to whom Georgy was supposed to lead me...
Tonight, Josaphat ― tonight when I come back...
Josaphat. 99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
So, what price are you demanding for leaving this residence tonight?
You still don't seem to have grasped who sent me here...
CENTRAL BANK OF METROPOLIS
This man doesn't want his son to find you still here tonight!
In three hours' time I shall be calling for you!
It is time to give the Man-Machine your face!
Where is Maria ― ? !
She's with your father...
I'm telling you, she is with your father ― !
"She is the most perfect and most obedient tool that a man has ever possessed! Tonight you shall see how she holds up before the eyes of the upper hundred. You shall see her dance, and if only one single person recognises the machine in her,
C. Rotwang"
"C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen to be his guest this evening."
I want you to go to those in the Depths in order to annihilate the work of your prototype!
"C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen to be his guest this evening."
Verily, I say unto you: the days of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh...!
All Seven Deadly Sins, on her behalf ― !
Death overtakes the City ― !
END OF THE INTERMEZZO
The Revelation of St. John Avalun Publishing, Hellerau
I escaped from the Thin Man wearing this attire... But for ten days your father's bloodhound has been making the Workers' City unsafe...
The only thing keeping the workers in check is their expectation for the Mediator promised unto them...
Even stranger things have been happening, Freder...
On that evening when you fell ill once the best of friends...
but night after night in Yoshiwara...
And this woman, at whose feet all sins are heaped is also called Maria...
That same woman that those in the Depths regard as a saint ― ? !
Many now go to the City of the Dead, to a woman they have judged to be as true as gold.
The Mediator is not likely to miss that occasion...
Whatever happens tonight: it is my express order to allow the workers to do as they please...
Joh Fredersen wants to let those in the Depths use force and do wrong so that he can claim the right to use force against them...
When you spoke to your poor brothers, you talked about peace, Maria... today a mouthpiece of Joh Fredersen incites them to rebel against him...
She will destroy their belief in the Mediator!
You know I've always talked about peace... but your Mediator hasn't come...
You've waited long enough! Your time has come ― !
...but I've tricked Joh Fredersen! Your clone does not obey his will ― only mine alone!
Who is the living fodder for the machines for Metropolis ― ? !
Who smears the machine-joints with their own marrow ― ? !
Who feeds the machines with their own flesh ― ? !
Let the machines starve, you fools ― ! Finish them off ― !
Do them in ― these machines ― !
You aren't Maria ― !
YOU ARE NOT MARIA ― !
Maria talks of peace, not murder ― ! This is not Maria ― !
Joh Fredersen's son ― !
Do him in, the dog, in his white silken hide ― !
Get your women, your sons, out of the Workers' City! Let no-one stay behind! Death to the machines ― !
In the attic of his home, Rotwang displays for Maria his ever-growing intoxication with his triumph over Fredersen: " ― and twice over did I trick Joh Fredersen ― !
For I concealed from him that his son wants to be the Mediator of your brothers ― and is in love with you ― !"
Maria isn't the only one listening to Rotwang. On the other side of the attic's window, Joh Fredersen was eavesdropping... Joh Fredersen breaks into Rotwang's attic.
He wrestles with his old rival and overtakes him. Maria is free.
...faithful after all...
We still have to go through the Workers' City.
Women and men, let no-one miss out on today ― ! Death to the machines ― !
Not one man ― not one woman has stayed behind ― !
Leave the machines ― ! Let them race to their death ― !
To the Heart-Machine ― !
DANGER
Open the gates!
You have to open the gates!
If the Heart-Machine perishes, nothing in the Machine-District will be left standing ― !
Have you lost your minds ― ? If the Heart-Machine perishes, the entire Workers' City will be laid to waste ― !
Where are your fathers, your mothers?
Do you have any idea that your son is amongst the workers? !
Yes ― you! You're Maria ― !
To the air shafts ― quickly! Quickly! The reservoirs have burst!
We'll take the children to the Sons' Club!
Why are all the lights out?
I need to know ― ! Where is my son? !
Tomorrow thousands will ask in fury and desperation: Joh Fredersen, where is my son ― ? !
Where are your children? !
The city is drowned, the shafts are totally flooded ― !
Who bade you attack the machines, without which you're finished, you idiots ― ? !
It's the witch's fault ― !
We'll be looking on as the world goes to the devil ― !
Find the witch; this is all her fault ― ! Strike her dead ― !
Now I'm going to take you home, my Hel ― !
the witch ― ! There she is ― ! there she is ― !
Where are our children, you witch, you ― ? !
Burn the witch. ― To the stake with her!
To the stake with her ― !
Hel ― ! My Hel ― !
Your children... saved ― !
Head and hands want to join together, but they don't have the heart to do it... Oh Mediator, show them the way to one another...
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART!

Sunrise A Song of Two Humans
This song of the Man and his Wife is of no place and every place:
you might hear it anywhere at any time.
For wherever the sun rises and sets in the city's turmoil or under the open sky on the farm life is much the same:
sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet
Summertime... vacation time
Among the vacationists was a Woman of the City.
Several weeks had passed since her coming and still she lingered.
"They used to be like children, carefree... always happy and laughing..."
"They used to be like children, carefree...
always happy and laughing..."
"Now he ruins himself for the woman from the city - Money-lenders strip the farm - "
"Now he ruins himself for the woman from the city - Money-lenders strip the farm - and his wife sits alone."
"Tell me!
You are all mine?"
"Sell your farm...
come with me to the City."
"...and my wife?"
"Couldn't she get
"Couldn't she get drowned?
"...then overturn the boat... it will look like an accident."
"Leave this behind...
come to the City!"
"COME TO THE CITY!"
"...after the boat has capsized, save yourself with these bulrushes."
"The rushes will hold you up. Scatter them before you reach the shore and tell everyone she drowned by accident."
"We're going for a trip across the water.
"Don't be afraid of me!"
"Don't be afraid of me!"
"God is giving you, in the holy blonds of matrimony, a trust.
She is young... and inexperienced.
"...keep and protect her from all harm."
"Wilt thou LOVE her?"
"Forgive me!"
"Manicure?"
"You'd look grand with a high polish!"
"Come again!"
"Thank you!
And you must come and see us some time."
"Congratulations!
"FARMERS!
"Hit the hole...
make the little piggy roll!"
"We'll sail home by moonlight...
I couldn't give up hope. I know the tides... I went around the Point..."
THE CIRCUS
THE CIRCUS
"So you missed the hoop again."
"Father, I couldn't help it."
"For that you don't eat tonight."
"And you're supposed to be funny!"
"Look at that house; empty!"
Around the Side Shows hungry and broke.
"Here you are, sir."
"Count it."
"Is it all there?"
"Say, gimme that money!"
"How d'you get out of here?"
"Rotten!"
"Get off!"
"Where's the funny man?"
"Bring on the funny man!"
The Funny Man.
Meal-time after the Show.
"Father won't let me."
"Do you want a job?"
"Be here in the morning, and we'll try you out."
Early the next morning.
Hungry.
"Run along home!"
"I live here."
"Excuse me, my cane."
The Tryout.
"Go ahead and be funny."
"That's awful!"
"Put on the William Tell act."
"Now then, watch this and see if you can do it."
"Go ahead and try it."
"Put on the barber-shop act."
"Now I must hit you."
"Now hit me!"
"I can't see."
"Just a moment!"
"We haven't talked terms yet."
"Get out and stay out!"
"Show's starting!"
"Aren't you coming in?"
"You're not leaving?"
"You see, we couldn't come to terms."
"Thank you for the egg."
The Show on.
Trouble with the Property Men.
"How about our back pay?"
"Get to work!"
"We quit!"
"They've quit."
"Get anybody!"
"Do you want a job?"
"Don't touch that button!"
"He's a sensation, but he doesn't know it." "Keep him on as a property man."
The Circus prospered, but not the property man. And the girl led the same hard life.
"Keep him busy and don't let him know he's the hit of the show."
A Sick Horse.
"Blow this pill down the horse's neck!"
"The horse blew first --"
"Open the door, quick!"
"I told you the lions were dangerous!"
"Where's that pill?"
"Come here!"
"I've got to see a doctor!"
"It's a shame the way they make you work --" "And you the hit of the show."
"Why of course!" "All the crowds, all the applause is just for you."
"I knew it!"
"If you strike that girl, I'll quit!"
"And what's more I want what I'm worth --"
"I'll give you fifty dollars a week."
"Sixty!"
"I'll double it!"
"Nothing less than a hundred."
The Next Show.
The success of the Tramp made life easier for the girl and himself.
"Oh, Merna, you must have your fortune told!"
"I see love and marriage with a dark, handsome man who is near you now."
A New Added Attraction, Rex, a tight-rope walker.
"Pardon me."
"Go right ahead."
"I'll give you Five Dollars for it."
"It's happened;
I'm in love!"
"He's a tight-rope walker." "I've just met him."
"Hurry up, you're on!"
The Act Over.
"What's the matter?" "You hardly got a laugh!"
"This is my friend."
"I don't like tight-rope walkers."
Time brought many changes to the Circus; New Hopes and New Ambitions.
His New Ambition.
"Never mind the rope." "You'd better try and be funny again or you'll go!"
The next performance- and not a smile.
"I've had enough of this;" "You get one more chance."
"Where's Rex?"
"Rex, the tight-rope walker, hasn't shown up."
"Is Rex here?"
"You can do the act, can't you?"
"You'll do it or quit!"
"I'll do it; find his clothes!"
"There's the clothes!"
"You follow her!"
"He'll kill himself."
"That's all right;" "I've got him insured."
"Take your time, there's another act to go on."
"Why, what is the meaning of this?"
"I am taking his place on the rope."
"You'll get killed."
"Oh, no, I have a charmed life."
"I'll give you five dollars if you'll do it."
"Not a word to anybody."
"Please don't do this."
"You've forgotten your tights."
"You're on!"
"You're through!"
That Night.
"I've run away from the circus."
"I'll never go back."
"Can't you take me with you?"
"I've got an idea."
"You stay here."
"Have you seen Merna?"
"She's run away --"
"I can do nothing for her -- --"
"Now, there's one way out."
"She's there now?"
"Take me to her!"
The Next Morning.
The Circus ready to leave.
"So you've come back -
- You -- !"
"You're speaking to my wife!"
"Will you go on with the show?"
"-- -- if you take him."
"The end wagon for you."
"Come in with us."

Is another train coming?
You've got so many flacons, you are worse than my daughter.
Wait here until it stops raining.
Do you know what?
Let it rain, you can spend the night in my house.
Hurry up, Andrea, I must go to work.
You know that I am afraid of strangers, Father.
Don't be silly, this man is no thief!
Where would you go?
There is no hotel in our village. Stay here.
The storm must have cut off the wires.
I know you shall never come back...
And...
What's the matter?
Would you mind if I leave, Father?
Do you want to visit your aunt?
Very well then, go.
Why do people forget so quickly?
Why do people forget so quickly?
I yearn for you though I know you will never return. I do not dare to die.
It would kill my father if I told him. I am so helpless!
I cosset it inside of me, even if I feel that my life has reached its end.
I do not know why I write this letter, but I feel relief in knowing that you have not thought about me once.
My poor husband is waiting for me at the theatre.
What will you tell him about where you were?
With my lover!
You would never say that!
Your key!
Who is that gentleman?
Where does he live?
Tell him to wait!
You can say whatever you wish!
I know you are lying!
I would not like to be in her shoes.
You're impossible, you would even delude a saint!
I will divorce you!
Did your "little daughter" write?
It is said he will soon be a grandfather!
They say she tied that man who spent the night at your house.
No one will dare touch the chastity of my daughter!
Your child was stillborn. Perhaps it is better for you this way.
How some men handle their love affairs.
You see, you were here a few days longer and bed and board costs money.
Wandering aimlessly.
I am sending you some money, do not take everything so tragically.
But you wanted to go the other way.
The man who was to come for the blood transfusion is not here.
Maybe I...
Do you know how you got injured?
Your wife saved you your life.
My wife?
Yes, your wife. Don't you remember?
You brought her here in your car.
Could you bring my wife here then?
I am sorry but I can deliver this piano model only in a few weeks as I have just sold the last one.
My wife.
I can wait a few weeks for the other piano.
Dangerous friendship.
You were not home, because you knew I would come.
He is a fine man. I hope he will make a good impression on you.
...And in the evening In the morning In the morning I ask you to reject my husband's invitation.
Forgive me, I should have done that myself.
...I know what pain I have caused you.
You may laugh at whatever I say to apologise to you. But I love you.
Have you forgiven me?
Yet in the evening...
I love you and I am jealous of you because you love your husband.
Andrea, I want you to...
Do not lie to me, he is the man who had your picture!
Who?
That annoying man!
I do not know him at all!
I will keep an eye on that gentleman!
You must come with us tomorrow, we will be most pleased if you join us.
If you only knew what I think of him!
And what I think of you!
Not even an angel could put up with you!
I love you so much because you are not like other men, you are not jealous.
I am not jealous, because I trust you.
I have a terrible headache.
I am so tired.
...I almost forgot.
I will give you back your key, you will need it for someone else.
On the "trip".
On the "trip".
Don't you think that leading a simple family life is most fortunate?
Why don't you get married then?
It is quite simple and easy.
That is what you think!
...I think you will lose.
Do you want me to lose?
We did not have time to tell you that we are leaving tomorrow.
It is my wife's wish. It is so nice in the south at this time of the year.
Yes, it is nice, indeed.
I hope to see you soon again!
What kind of a comedy is this!
Why aren't you sincere, Andrea?
I was never more sincere as today!
I think our trip will do you good, you will calm down.
I am calm, but you are jealous, and you are running away like a coward!
How "love" ends...
Give this letter to my husband at 5 o'clock.
Very well!
This is the end then!
You shall never see me again!
Was anyone here?
Will you believe me if I say that no one?
To loyalty - to all women!
I swear your wife is not in the room!
Liar!
The past that shall always be the past.
Shall we go?
Yes, let us go!
The End
NOTE: No original 35mm nitrate materials for ETERNAL LOVE are known to survive.
Although UCLA has used the best available sources the picture quality of this restoration is substandard.
ETERNAL LOVE
In the year 1806 France and Austria were at each other's throats; and Switzerland, lying squarely betweem the two became unwillingly a highroad for armies.
All residents of this district possessing firearms must surrender them at the Town Hall by ten o'Clock Sunday morning.
Any disobedience of this order will subject the entire community to severe punishment.
"We won't give up our guns!
We'll fight for our rights!"
"You must give them up!
What chances have we a mere handful...
against a trained army?"
"Let us thank God that every man among us surrendered his gun to preserve our peace!"
"Is he here, Pia?"
"That's him!"
"What do you want?"
"I want you!"
"I know who they're for!
Father Tass' niece!"
"I'll get you yet, Marcus!"
"Why must you rebel against us, Marcus?
You endanger the whole community!"
"Give up your gun!"
"Come on!
Who wants to follow Lorenz Gruber?"
"My gun is my life!
Who dares to take it away from me?"
"Won't you give it up...
for me, Marcus?"
"Leave him to his lawless ways, my niece."
"What he did to me is nothing...
it's what he did to you!
Do you still believe he loves you?"
"He wouldn't even give you his gun!
That shows how much he cares for you."
"Ciglia, I have always loved you... but you would never listen to me..."
"I LOVE YOU!"
"I want to tell the whole world... the mountains... the sky! I love Ciglia!"
The white blanket of winter.
"The occupation is ended...
the French have gone!
We are free!"
...and never in the memory of Pontresina was there such a carnival ball so gay... so happy...
so carefree...
"Ciglia!"
"Unmask!"
"Marcus...
I want to go home."
"Marcus... you are out of your senses!"
"I love you...
I love you madly!"
My beloved Marcus:
Let the memory of last night be wiped out of our minds.
My love is unchanged.
I am waiting for you. Ciglia.
"When Marcus comes, will you give your consent to our marriage?"
"If it means your happiness, Ciglia, I will set my doubts aside..."
"I'll tell Father Tass you want to see him."
"Don't you love me any more?"
"Uncle has consented at last!
Soon we'll be husband and wife!"
"Think, Marcus... nothing can ever threaten our happiness again!
"You are keeping something from me.
Tell me what it is... tell me!"
"I've been to Father Tass. I've told him everything!"
"...and you've got to marry her!"
"We love each other!
How can we go through life apart?"
"This isn't a very happy marriage..."
"Serves him right! He was always wild.
But I'm sorry for Ciglia."
"She won't grieve forever Not with Lorenz Gruber coming to see her every day."
"Do you, Marcus Paltram, promise to take this woman to be faithful to her only..."
"Give me time, Lorenz..."
"Help me, O Lord, that I may forget him!"
"... Ciglia, do you promise to love your husband until death do you part... to be faithful to him in deed... and in thought..."
"I... do."
"Does Ciglia ever think of him now?"
"I laugh for happiness!
The best and prettiest girl in all Switzerland is mine!"
"Marcus hasn't come home from the mountains!
We must gather a rescue party!"
"Marcus is lost in the mountains..."
"You can't sit here and let him die!
Do something!"
"No, I say!
I'll not lift a hand! Let him die!"
"I thank Thee...
that Thou didst save him."
"... Move away from Pontresina, Marcus. Leave me in peace with Ciglia."
"I'll give you everything I own if you'll go..."
"I know why you wouldn't take his money!
You're still in love with that..."
"Now you die!
And I live... in peace!"
"I could kill you!
But I won't...
because of Ciglia."
"...his gun was where he fell, but he disappeared I looked for him...
and couldn't find him."
"We must find him, Marcus!"
"Cigl..."
"Murderer!"
"Marcus is innocent!
I know he is!"
"She's the guilty one!
She made him do it!"
"They've gotten away!
To the mountains!"
"Leave me, Marcus...
save yourself!"
"What can we do now?"
"O Lord, Thou knowest our innocence...
Thou knowest that love is our only sin...
...have pity on us..."
"Don't separate us again!
Take us... take us together...
unto Thyself..."
"Never to be parted again...
together through all eternity!"

Hey, two.
Gee, I'm dead.
So am I.
Gloria.
Oh, Mother, you frightened me.
My feet are almost dead.
And I haven't half finished!
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mother.
I've got to have a little more money.
Hello, Mrs. Hughes.
Hello, Barbara!
How are you, little sweetheart?
Hello, Mrs. Hughes.
How are you feeling today?
Hello, Buddy.
How are you?
I'm fine, fine.
That's all I have.
That isn't half enough.
Aw, gee whiz, Ma.
Gee whiz, nothing.
Young lady, if you haven't got it, you've got to get it.
- My feet are all...
- Gloria.
Gloria.
Here, I can spare this $5 until you get paid.
Aw, Buddy, you're a dear, sweet boy.
Thanks so much.
- Goodbye, Buddy.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Hughes.
See you at home, Gloria.
I don't know how she does it, but Mom certainly can smell money.
Thanks, Buddy.
I'll pay you back Saturday.
That's all right, Gloria.
Remember what I always fold ya... you can have anything I've got.
Of course, I haven't got anything, but... you can have all of it.
Thanks.
Oh, Buddy...
You remember the dreams I used to have about the Follies?
Yeah.
Well...
I guess they were only dreams.
Why don't you try to get in again?
I've been thrown out of there too many times now.
The only way they'd let me stay inside is to have the joint quarantined.
-The first time was all right—
-Maybe you're right about that, kid.
- No more for me.
- Gee, that's tough luck.
Lookie, kids.
We're gonna have another outing!
- That's swell!
When is it?
Gee!
- Great!
Come on, dear.
Let's sneak away on the lake, shall we?
Yeah, come on.
Your beautiful tribute has brought the tears to my eyes.
On this occasion... the 41st anniversary... of Heimer's, of which I have the honor of being your president of ten years... of service, loyalty and cooperation.
With our proud duty to our community... with the noble heritage of our past, with the glorious promise of our future, thrilling to that duty of service and loyalty, one for all, and all for one!
One big, happy family.
We stand hand-in-hand, shoulder-to-shoulder, and back-to-back in this great fight!
But let us always remember the customer is always right!
But right or wrong, our country needs us!
Gosh, Gloria, isn't this better than sitting there, singing our heads off to that old pretzel?
Mm-hmm.
Gee, I don't know.
When you're close to me like this, you...
You just burn me up.
I guess that's the same kind of funny feeling I get, Buddy.
Yoo-hoo!
Buddy!
-If we could only be like this, always.
Hmm.
- In a canoe?
- Anywhere.
A little flat.
And I'd come home to you every night.
- And you'd be waiting there...
- On, [ would, would 1?
Any old time I stay at home all day, waiting for a man...
Yeah, but lots of girls do, dear.
Now, Buddy.
You've been reading your fairy tales again.
And the little princess waited for her little Prince Charming.
No, darling.
Not for little Gloria.
I want to go places and do things before I settle down and raise a lot of little passengers for the subway.
Oh, Buddy.
Let's sing your new song.
How does it go?
-I When luck defies you I
-Wait, wait, I know.

All right.

Come on, some speed.
Ladies and gentlemen!
The first act on the bill will be
Miller and Mooney... dancing team.
Come here.

Who are you, anyway?
I am woman, one of nature's loveliest pieces of architecture.
Oh, yeah?
Gee, that's great.
I'm a building inspector.
Some gal.
- Say, do you know what I call my girl?
- No, what do you call your girl?
I call my girl Grapefruit.
Why do you call your girl Grapefruit?
"Cause every time I squeeze her, she hits me in the eye."
You're so funny.

What's the idea of butting in on my bow?
Your bow?
Hey, bozo, I always finish with you, don't I?
As far as I'm concerned, you're finished to a T.
That finish routine makes a big hit with me.
Well, I got along a darn fine better before I married you.
Yes, you got along before you married me, swishing your tail in burlesque.
Listen, Belle, ( was only kidding you.
You didn't take me seriously, did you, kid?
Say, I didn't mean that.
Forgive me this time, will ya?
Just this time, honey.
Gloria, why don't you try that cute little dance you used to do?
- Oh, na.
- Come on.
We gotta go on.
Yeah, we do.
Attagirl, Gloria.
Come on, Gloria.
Come on!
Say there, kid.
You're some cute dancer.
Thanks.
I can do much better than that, but I haven't practiced for years.
With a little practice, I think you'd be able to make the grade in the big time.
You really think so?
I should say so.
Where can I get in touch with you?
Say...
Oh, don't worry, buddy.
Strictly business.
Well, I...
I'm Gloria Hughes.
And I work in the song department at Helmer's.
Say, I'd like to look you up.
You mind if I show you some of my new dance steps?
No, I'd love it.
- Okay with you, sonny?
- My name isn't sonny.
Say, I didn't ask you to climb up on my knee.
It's Buddy.
Okay, Buddy.
Time step.
I can't get that first part right, where it starts... 2 When...
I think it's great just that way.
Yeah?
What do you know about it?
Well, I know the things that I like.
And one of them is your song.
- Geez, it's the boss.
- Go on, Buddy.
That's swell.
Geez, it's the boss.
What's the idea?
Nobody's singing here?
Where's Gloria?
Why, she had a bad toothache and had to go to the doctor's.
I mean, the dentist.
Oh, Barbara.
-Yes, sir.
"Where's Gloria today?
Uh...
Her grandmother died this morning.
She had to go to the funeral this afternoon.
Well, she can go to her own funeral now.
I'm sick of these girls walking in and out of this place as they please.
And when she comes in, tell her not to hang around for a check.
We'll mail it to her.
Gee, Buddy, did you hear what he said?
I was afraid this was gonna happen to Gloria.
I knew she was spending too much time with that Miller guy.
Lackawanna-6100.
Sheet music.
Hello, Buddy?
Hey, Buddy, brace yourself.
I've got some great news for you.
We've just been booked for 20 weeks.
- Gee, Barbara, they made it!
- Oh, great!
But this is the greatest news of all.
We leave tonight at 8:00 for the West.
Yeah.
Yes!
Gee, Buddy.
Aren't you happy?
And you're the first person I've fold.
I've got to run and pack now, dear.
Hurry over as soon as you can.
I'll be there.
Goodbye.
Golly, that's wonderful.
Yeah.
Wonderful.
Sections 5 and 7 on the Chicago.
Better hurry.
Only got a minute.
He isn't here.
Something must have happened.
Come on, Gloria.
We've only got a minute.
Board!
Barbara.
Pay for this, will you, please?
Oh, Buddy!
Damn it.
You better get that piano player out of your mind.
He never did anything for you.
What of it?
Now, Gloria.
For instance, take Mr. Miller.
He's—- Yeah.
You take him.
Well, if it wasn't for him, you'd still be yelling your head off at Heimer's.
Am I any better off now?
Eating a lot of greasy food, one cheap hotel after another, playing five a day.
- "Well, you make a lot of money.
- Yeah, a lot of it [ get.
Well, of course, you'd only spend it foolishly.
- I'm saving it for you.
- Yeah, I know.
A lot of thanks I get after all I've done for you.
Didn't I raise you and slave for you?
And worked my fingers to the bone.
Yeah, I know that old story too.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma.
I appreciate everything you've done for me.
I'll try my best to forget Buddy.
Oh, Gloria, darling.
You always were a good, good girl.
I've got to go to the drugstore before it closes.
Hurry now, dear.
You only have a few minutes.
Good evening, Mr. Miller.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Hughes.
I'm on my way 10 the drugstore.
Can I get you some more corn plasters?
No, thanks, Mother.
I've got enough to last me another thousand miles.
That old dame gets in my hair.
2 When you forget to remember
It's a wonder you wouldn't knock.
Aha.
It is often said a boost is better than a nap.
Well, smarty, you can just boost yourself right out of here.
Now, now, gorgeous.
Don't get violent.
- Please, I'm in a hurry.
- Just look at those pretty lips.
How about a little kiss?
How about a little bite instead?
Come on.
Cut out the wisecracking, will ya?
I like you a whole lot.
Well, let it end there.
But I can't, baby.
I'm just nuts about you.
Gee, every time I lock at you, I just go daffy.
- Please.
I'm in a hurry.
- Gloria, I'm crazy about you.
Don't do that.
I'll make you like my kisses, you little devil.
Now, you get out of here, and get out quick, before I start throwing things.
Let me tell you something, baby.
I can get another Mooney for this act overnight.
And if you're gonna get fresh with me, you'll find yourself back in the alley where I found you.
Hey, gorgeous.
Come here.
Oh, how do you de?
You're Mr. Miller, aren't you?
You said it, baby.
I'd like to have a little talk with you.
Won't you come into my office?
You know, baby, I got a load of you from the wings yesterday.
And I think you're plenty hat.
Oh, Mr. Miller.
While I was watching your routine work, I got an idea.
How'd you like to get out of that line and team up with a real act?
Oh, Mr. Miller!
You know, Mooney and I don't hit it off so well together.
Besides being slow on her feet, she's got a bad disposition.
And I thought maybe you'd like to take her place.
Oh, Mr. Miller!
Say, I've got an idea.
How would you like to come up to my place after the show and we'll talk this thing over.
You never can tell around here.
There are too many big ears.
Well?
What do you say?
How about a little kiss to seal the bargain?
What's the matter?
Did you and Miller have a fight?
I just heard him talking to another girl about taking your place.
- When?
- She's in there now.
You must have done something to make him mad.
What was it?
Oh, that dirty bum sneaked in here and started one of his mauling scenes.
I got a little sore and I told him where to get off at.
I knew I shouldn't leave you alone.
Every time I do, you mess things up.
What are we gonna do if he kicks you out?
I'm sorry, Ma, but that's not part of our act.
Miller and Mooney on next.
- All right.
- Hook me up quick, will you?
Hello, hello.
Mr. Miler, you're on.
Yes?
How am I doing?
Well, we have just about enough money to get us back to New York.
And if you ever open your mouth again, I'll put my foot in it.
All right.
I'm sorry, Mr. Miller.
I didn't mean that.
That's the last time you're gonna bum me up and knock me cold.
I was only joking.
All I want you to do is go on and do the act.
Is this the act you want to see, Mr. Sharpe?
That's the new Mooney.
I wonder how they're hooked up.
I don't suppose they're hooked up at all.
I understand he has a new Mooney every few weeks.
Don'tthinkyourworkisover At close of day J 2 When night comes "round You mustn't stop to rest "
J Put on your patent leathers And make your way 2 To where your feet Must take their dancing turn
4" Heels burning up, toes turning up Sparks flying around J 2 When you get those old hot feet To heat up the ground "

J Put your old hot feet That beat the beat on the ground 2
How do you like the act?
All right.
Let's go back and see them.
Oh, Mr. Miller.
I'm sorry about Gloria.
But I'm sure I can fix everything.
- Oh, you can, can you?
- Yes.
Well, there's nothing to fix.
Hey, Danny.
Danny.
Did you know Sharpe was outside?
- You mean Stanley Sharpe, from Ziegfeld?
- Yeah.
Old boy Stanley, en?
I guess Ziggy sent him on to get me to sign for next season.
He thinks because I'm playing this town, he can get me for coffee and cake money.
Well, he'll lay it on the line too, baby.
"This is Miller speaking."
Oht
Hello, Mr. Sharpe.
I'm Miller.
You know, Miller of Miller and Mooney.
- Yeah, I just caught you.
- Oh, yeah?
How'd you like it, eh?
Pretty good, huh?
Yeah.
By the way, how about Mooney?
Oh, money?
We can get together on that, all right, Mr. Sharpe.
How are you hooked up?
You know.
I manage to put away a little something every week...
No, old man, you got me wrong.
I mean the girl, Mooney, your partner.
Oh, I see.
You mean...
We're hooked up all right.
You know, partners.
Of course, the kid's a little new yet, but...
I think with a little more work, I'll make her pan out all right.
Where is the girl?
I'd like to have a chat with her.
She had to duck right after the performance, Mr. Sharpe.
Dancing for one of those big parties.
Didn't even have time to change her costume.
Too bad.
I'd like to have seen her.
Oh, I'll tell her you called.
I'll bring her around to see you, Mr. Sharpe.
I suppose you're at the Blackstone.
No trouble.
I'll get in touch with her later.
Oh, no trouble, Mr. Sharpe.
Say, I'm tickled to death to do it for Ziegfeld.
Well, all right.
You were right, Danny.
Make him put it on the dotted line.
Let him know it's Miller speaking.
That was just Sharpe's way of trying to beat me down.
Before I'd let him touch me, I'll go back to Heimer's.
I guess that's where you'll have to go now.
And the act was going so grand.
I know it.
You won't get applause like that down at Heimer's.
Aw, gee, Ma.
I'm sorry.
I thought I told you to knock when you came in here!
Gloria!
Now, Gloria, why do you always pick on me?
Mr. Miller, you don't understand Gloria.
She was only playing with you, not picking on you.
"Weren't you, Gloria?
Uh-huh,
Well, I'm certainly glad to hear that.
For a while, she had me fooled.
You know, Mrs. Hughes,
Gloria and I just had a little spat.
Oh, Mr. Miller, that isn't anything.
Everybody has a spat now and then.
Well, here's what I was thinking of, Mrs. Hughes.
In order to protect Gloria in the future, in case these little spats should occur again,
You know, a partnership.
Oh, Mr. Miller.
I just think that's lovely of you to have Gloria's interest at heart.
And I certainly think a contract would be fine for both of you.
Don't you think so, Gloria?
Yes.
But why the sudden change?
A little while ago, you wanted to kick me out on my ear.
Aw, gee whiz, Gloria.
Yeah, I knew it all the time.
But I don't want to sign any agreement.
Oh, Gloria.
Don't you see that Mr. Miller's just doing it for your good?
Well, if Gloria feels that way about if, I wouldn't want her to sign.
Mr. Miller, just a minute, please.
I knew it.
After the way I've worked for you and slaved for you, what do you do?
You never think of your poor mother.
Al right, Ma.
I sign.
You know, Gloria, after all, it's you I'm thinking of.
I worked dam hard teaching you my routines.
All right.
If its going to be a partnership, we'll make everything 50-50.
-50-507 -50-50.
Oh, Gloria.
I work just as hard as you do, and I want half of everything.
- Nothing doing.
- No contract.
Oh, well...
What's the difference?
That's okay.
Well, here's the game.
"It is mutually agreed... that we are equal partners in the team of Miller and Mooney... and will split all earnings... biting... et cetera...
50-50... for a period of five years'...
- Five years?
- Why, of course, Gloria!
Certainly.
All right.
"...from the above date."
Porter!
Hey, Buddy.
I can't see a thing.
Can you see her?
No, I can't.
Gloria!
Gloria!
You look like a big star.
No, I don't.
I had a marvelous trip.
Damn it.
Gloria!
I say, Gloria!
Oh, I might have known something like this would have happened.
Ain't it awful?
It just makes me sick.
Mo, it's lousy.
Let's ankle out of here.
All right.
Stage door, New Amsterdam Theater.
43rd Street.
Buddy!
Buddy!
Buddy!
Get an ambulance!
Quick!
Get her back!
How annoying!
I suppose some hayseed thought he was back on the farm.
I guess you're right, Mother.
All right, boys.
Come here.
What do you say?
Double or nothing for the tip.
- Tails.
- Heads.
You lose.
Boy, New Amsterdam Theater.
Stage door.
Gee, I wish you didn't have to go to rehearsal and we could be alone tonight.
Yes, dear.
It would be nice to be alone.
But this is much more important.
Yeah, if that's what you think.
Why, Buddy!
This is my big chance.
I know it, dear.
Gee, Buddy.
Just think.
Wouldn't it be great to have my name in lights?
Yes.
It'd be great.
What's happened, Gloria?
You seem different.
Oh, Buddy.
Don't be silly.
Remember the dreams we used to have about the stage when we were kids?
You remember how Mike used to throw Barbara and us out of the New Amsterdam?
I should say I do.
Those things make cold shivers run up my back.
Yeah, they give me the creeps, too.
Where were we?
Oh, we were talking about Barbara.
Can you imagine us running off and leaving her?
Why?
What do you mean?
- Was she down there to meet me?
- Yeah.
Oh, Buddy.
I guess she'll get home all right.
- Got that end all right?
- Okay.
- Oh, Buddy, doesn't this look familiar?
-'ll say so.
-Isn't that Mike?
I think so.
Sure, it's Mike.
You don't remember us, do you?
You used to throw us out of here when we were kids.
And I'll throw you cut again.
You will not!
I'm Gloria Hughes!
- Little Gloria Hughes?
- Yes!
But now I'm Mooney, of Miller and Mooney.
I knew you'd make good.
You were always a fresh little egg.
Well, I guess you'll be seeing a lot of us now.
Oh, boy, I'm scared stiff.
Come on.
You'll be all right.
Hold it
What's the matter with you girls?
Are you afflicted with housemaid's knee?
Raise your legs on that kick.
You work like a lot of rheumatics.
- All right, come on.
We'll try it again.
- Gloria.
What do you mean by running away and leaving me?
Oh, Mother.
I was so excited.
I couldn't wait for you!
Hello, Mrs. Hughes.
How are you?
Oh, it's Buddy!
I suppose you're still down at Heimer's store.
- Yes, I am.
- I thought so.
Say, Dad...
Who's the old gray-haired guy out there?
That's Pop Morgan, the director.
Oh.
Hold it.
Girls, girls, what is the matter with you today?
Why, you're positively stupid!
Why don't you listen to me?
(All right.
We'll do it again.
So I says to this guy, "Nerts," I says.
- Oh, you didn't.
- Didn't, huh?
He can't get away with that stuff with me.
My God, my feet are killing me.
Come on, girls.
Pep it up, come on.
0Oh, lay an egg, you old coot.
That's one director you can call what you damn please.
He's as deaf as a post.
But, boy, how he can read lips.
He keeps his ears glued to the piano.
Getting vibrations, or something, the old coot.
Come on, come on.
You're like a lot of old washerwomen.
Blow it in your hatch, you old, white-headed rooster.
Step out of that line.
I saw what you called me.
I didn't call you anything.
Really, Mr. Morgan.
I just said I was one of your greatest boosters.
Boost yourself to your room.
I'm not gonna stick around here all day.
I think I'll tell that bird who I am.
Yes.
Go ahead.
A little pep now, girls.
Come on.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey!
"Who are you "heying"?
This is a team going into the show.
A theme?
What theme?
No, a team.
Miller and Mooney.
I'm Miller.
You know, Miller, of Miller and Mooney.
You're a team, huh?
Where's the rest of ya?
- Here I am.
Hello, Mr. Sharpe.
- Hello, Miss Mooney.
This is Mr. Morgan, the director.
Mr. Morgan, this is Miller and Mooney.
How do you do?
Say, do you want us to do our stuff for ya?
Well, you certainly can't dance with those clothes.
-Get 'em off.
"Where can I change?
Anywhere on the stage.
Over there, anywhere.
Oh, Buddy, will you please bring me my bag?
All right, girls.
Give me the exit step.
I'm all set the way I am.
Put it there, Buddy.
Open it quickly, will you?
Listen, Mike.
Tell that laundryman to be careful of the laundry.
He lost two of my Pullman towels last week.
Oh-ho, that's a good one!
Gloria.
I was thinking, if you get a chance, would...
Would you mind talking to him about my song?
- Your song?
- Yeah.
Gee, Buddy, give me a chance 10 get myself set first, will you?
Well, you needn't get sore about it.
All right, Charlie, here's the first number, "Hot Feet."
Play an 8-bar introduction and two chords.
- And don't forget the 8-bar tag.
- Yes.
And build up the finish, will ya?
- Okay, okay.
- Make it good and hot.
Nice and peppy.
Let's go.
All right, that'll do.
I can imagine the rest.
Come on, girls.
Let's have that last chorus.
Wait a minute.
Say...
Ain't you gonna give me a chance to show you my single?
I don't want to see your single.
- I'll knock "em dead!"
- All right, Joe.
Hit it.
I'll knock 'em dead, I tell ya!
I'll knock "em dead!"
I'll knock you dead if you don't stop veiling at me.
What's the matter, Mr. Sharpe?
I'm sorry, but if Pop Morgan doesn't like you, that's all.
But we signed a contract with you, Mr. Sharpe.
You've got to stand behind us.
I know, Miss Mooney.
But it can't be helped.
Listen, Mr. Morgan.
I'm not trying to tell you how to run your show, but we came here to show our stuff, and I want a chance to do it.
Well, just what can you do?
Well, I can do anything.
I can dance that chorus.
Or any chorus.
All right, let's see it.
Will you please take that mat up?
Boys, pick up this mat.
I've got to dance now.
I've waited all my life for this opportunity and I'm not gonna let it get away from me.
Gee, are you ready for the other one?
Come on now, hurry.
Don't rush me.
Remember, Gloria.
I'll be plugging for you.
Yes, Buddy, I know.
- Are you all right now?
- Oh...
Would you please play a waltz?
Why, I'd even "play house" for you.
Well, what do you think?
-See?
I told you all along she was great.
Quiet!
She'll hear you.
That guy knows as much about dancing as I know about building a bridge.
Mother!
I made it!
Oh, I'm so proud of you, honey.
Oh, Danny,
I'm awfully sorry.
So that's Miller and Mooney.
Hmm!
They can't kid me.
That's Mama and Papa.
Really too bad, Mr. Miller.
And after all you've done for Gloria.
Say, don't worry about me.
I'm not worried.
Remember, we're still partners.
Still partners?
Certainly.
Don't you remember that little agreement?
For five years?
Five years?
Mm-hmm.
And we split everything 50-50.
-50-50?
Mm-hmm.
You know, that was your idea, Gloria.
And I, being big-hearted, agreed.
Now all I have to worry about is your future.
Now you see the mess we're in?
Well, I guess it's all my fault.
Buddy!
Aren't you going to congratulate me?
Of course I do.
Why, Buddy!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Oh, you'll be busy, and I guess I'll go along.
No, don't go.
Yes, I...
I think I'd better.
Goodbye, Gloria.
Good evening, Buddy.
I've been trying to get you for hours.
And then [ guess I dozed off and the piano woke me up.
I'm awfully sorry, Miss Schultz.
I didn't realize it was so late.
Oh, t'ain't that.
But I've got some bad news for you.
- Bad news?
- Barbara is seriously hurt.
She's in the emergency ward at Bellevue Hospital.
What?
And she's calling for you.
I guess you'd better rush right on over.
Oh, telephone the New Amsterdam Theater and tell Miss Hughes about it.
Miss Hughes?
All right, son, I'll phone.
Buddy...
Buddy...
You... wait for me, Buddy.
Why are you always running away from me?
I'll never run away again, dear.
Oh, I was afraid you wouldn't get here.
It'll be all right.
I only got word a minute ago.
Don't leave me.
You'll never leave me again, will you, Buddy?
No, dear.
Never.
How do you do, ladies and gentlemen, this is Norman Brokenshire with the Columbia Broadcasting System.

Mother!
Oh, darling, you're going to be wonderful tonight.
Don't be scared now.
You'll make good.
I was frightened a little too when I first came with Ziegfeld, but I'm over it now.
Besides, they're a great audience.
I've got all my relatives out there.
And a few gentiles, too.
- Now, go after it, kid.
You'll make good.
- Thank you, Eddie.
That was wonderful!
Congratulations!
Mother, get them out.
I have a quick change.
- I'm sorry.
You must all go.

I'm sorry.

Al right!
Oh, there you are, my boy.
You've got the finest suit of clothes in the whole place, I'm telling you.
Wait, wait.
No, no, no, don't raise your arms.
I'm asking you, please, don't raise your arms.
You've got the finest suit in the whole place...
Moe! Moe!
Ain't you got that package wrapped up yet?
Go ahead, kill me.
Go ahead, kill me.
Here you are, my dear man.
I want to tell you something.
That is the best suit of clothes we've got in the whole house.
You won't be able to wear that suit out.
You'll be ashamed, I'm telling you.
You've got the finest suit of clothes in the whole place.
Oh, don't listen to him, he's a damn fool.
Go ahead.
I'm telling you, you've got the finest suit in the whole place.
Come in again.
Come in again sometime.
- Moe.
Listen to me, Moe.
- What's the matter?
Don't you tell anyone that I am a damn fool.
Don't you ever tell anyone that I am a damn fool!
I didn't know it was a secret.
Oh, hello, my friend!
Hi!
I'm glad to see you again!
Come in!
How are you, my little lemming?
What can I do for you?
- I'd like a nice, classy suit.
- A nice, classy suit.
Exactly!
Uh, college boy style.
College boy style!
It suits you perfectly!
Would you mind coming upstairs, walking up to our clothing department?
- Our elevator just broke down.
- Not at all.
And I want to let you in on something very secret.
We have just received a shipment of goods that was supposed to go to the Copenheimer company.
You know the Capenheimer company.
The best clothes in the whole world.
Now, I'm going to show you some styles, some material.
Some chutz that you'll be surprised.
Well, here we are in the clothing department.

I want to tell you something, my dear man.

That's the idea.
Let me see.
You take about a 46 stout.
Now, I've got for you here something very beautiful.
Here is a lovely golf suit.
A very handsome English Bucking-suit, the latest cut.
Comes right straight from the Piccadilly.
- Oh, lovely!
- Look at those shoulders.
- How that fits him!
- Wonderful!
Take a walk around.
See how you feel in the suit.
Just move around easy.
There's a nail sticking me in the back.
That's not a nail.
That's our own invention.
You know how you go into a restaurant, you hang up your umbrella and hat, and you get indigestion, you think somebody's gonna steal it?
This is our own invention.
When you take this, you can take your umbrella and your hat and you hang it up, and nobody can steal it from you.
Take a walk.

How does it feel now?
Its all right, but I don't eat in restaurants.
Look, eat in your Aunt Sarah's house.
I don't care where you eat.
But you take the suit.

Are you a sport?
Do you play casino?
You take the suit and we'll send you home in a taxicab.

You're gonna get a belt.
Here is something very lovely.
Here is a very lovely sack suit.
Here is a suit that only the gentlemen, of the whole people, is wearing.
Of course, the buttons don't meet, but...
I don't think they've ever been introduced.
Don't tell jokes.
You see what this suit is?
It's the latest Palm Beach model.
All the people is gonna wear two-button sack suits this season.
- I like the one-button.
- One-button?
We're here to please you, my dear man.
That's our job.
- How do you like that?
- Too tight for me.
Too tight.
All you've gotta do is tell me.
Turn around.
Go ahead.
Now, take a walk.
How does that feel?
It's all right, but a little cool in the back.
Cool!
That's what you call the cooling system.
That's the new Frigidaire.
With a suit like this, you couldn't get hot under the collar, you see?
You like the suit?

Listen, I have for you a very pretty smoking jacket.
I think you'll like this.
Every gentleman wears a smoking jacket like this...

All right.
Moe, alterations.
What do you mean alterations?

"Where do you need alterations?
He don't need it.
That fits him like a kimono.
What's the matter with you?
Look at that!
Look at that!
What's the matter with you?
Don't you know what it is?
That saves you from buying mittens in the wintertime.
Can't you see that we're saving you money?
- No, I'd like to have it fixed up.
- You want it fixed up?
So I'll fix it up.
What have we got to do'?

- And give him a slice here.
- Right in the middle, a slice.
- Above the appendix.
- On top of the appendix.
I haven't got an appendix.
Have you got tonsils?
Why are you telling me what you've got there?
Let's talk suits here.
You want patch pockets?

We are paying rent here, a year, $1,075.
It costs us for gas and electricity every month $35.
We are paying the police protection, they shouldn't break the windows, $25.
Last winter, my wife was sick.
What did It cost me?

Here, add it up.
What could be making profit on a suit like that?
Say, maybe I don't have to have it fixed.
That's what I'm telling you, you don't have to have it...
He's intelligent.
I could tell by his hair.
Of course you don't have to have it fixed.
You know why you don't have to have it fixed?
Because you don't have to have it fixed.
Some joke!
You like it?
You'll take it.
Listen!
Say "belt" and I'll kill you.
I'm telling you.
I'd like a blue serge suit.
Oh!
All right.
We're here to please you, my dear man.
If you want a blue serge suit, here you are.
Here is a nice blue serge suit for you.
Blue serge!
Yes, sir.
That's what you call pale navy blue.
- Pale navy blue.
- Pale navy.
Looks like banana color to me.
Do you want the suit or do you want vegetables?
What are you looking for?
- It's too light for me.
- You want it dark?
A dark-blue double-breasted suit.
He knows what he wants.
Here's a dark-blue double-breasted suit for you.
That's the best fit in the whole store.
- That's what you call two-in-one.
- That's lovely.
Two-in-one.
It's a suit and an overcoat combined.
You like the suit like this?
- I like a blue serge with a white stripe.
- With a white...
Ah!
With a stripe, with a stripe.
Say what you want.
Here you are.
How do you like that?
- I look like a zebra.
- Don't talk like a jackass.
What is a zebra?
A sport-model jackass.
It's nothing.
You like the suit?
My dear man, you look ten years younger to me.
You're just a kid.
I wish I had a balloon to give you.
I'll tell you something.
You're a different man.
Your own friends wouldn't recognize you in that suit.
Your own mother couldn't recognize you in that suit.
- That so?
- Really!
Take a look in the light.
Go outside.
Take a look at the material.
That's all you gotta do.
That's all right.
What I like about this is it's strong material.
- Yes, sir?
- I've always liked strong clothes.
What...
What can I do for you?
You see?
Even I didn't recognize you!
How do you like that?
Well, I want a belt in the back.
You want a belt...
Please, wait a minute.
Where are you going?
Stop a minute.
Don't be so excited.
Here, take that.
Look, I've got for you here a very beautiful hunting suit.
There is what I call a hunting suit.
The finest hunting suit, if I have ever seen, in this place.
- A hunting suit?
- Yes, a hunting suit.
Why do you call it a hunting suit?
We've been hunting for the pants for two years.
Now, wait a minute.
Here is the hat that goes with that suit.
How do you like that hat?
Good?
- It's too big for me.
- Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
What's too big about it?
I'm telling you, for two years you could wear that hat.
Take a walk.
For two years, my dear man, you could wear that hat.
- Yeah, but my hand will get tired.
- You change your hand.
You've got to tell them everything.
Well, how do you like it?
- Well, I'll take the hat.
- And the coat?
- No.
- And the coat.
Listen, they've been together for two years.
Why should you separate the hat and the coat?
I'll take the hat, but I want to look in the mirror.
Why should you look in the mirror and get discouraged?
-Can't you take my word for it?
"Would he lie to you?
We're not in business for that.
Well, how do you like that?
Let me tell you something.
When you're wearing a suit like that, you will be the talk of the town, I'm telling you.
You could go to a baseball game, and you'd stand up and holler,
Knack a home run!"
And the people would say, "Who is that fresh man?"
They'd see you and say, 'He's not fresh, he's wearing a Copenheimer coat."
You see what I mean?
You go to a dance at night.
You come up to a woman and say,
"Pardon me, could I have the next waltz with you, if you please?"
And she says, "He's too short.
Ah, but he's a Copenheimer."
So if you wear a Copenheimer, you can"t go wrong.
I'll tell you something.
In Washington, in the inauguration, what do you think Coolidge is saying to Hoover?
I want a belt in the back.
Let me out of here!
- Let him come.
- Just a minute.
Just a minute.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Let him come.
Listen, let's be honest with you.
If you want that suit with the belt in the back, we'll have to make it to order.
Is that so?
How much is it?
Well, you're a short man.
You take about two and a half yards.
- $65.
- That's too much.
Wait a minute.
We'll come to terms.
Wait a minute.
"Would you go to $52.507 No, sir.
"Would you spend $45?
No.
I'm telling you, a suit we're going to sell you.
You wouldn't get out of here without a suit, that you know.
That you know, don't you?
-You want to save $107
-Yes.
Walk upstairs.
Come along.
That's all you've got to do.
We're here to please you.
We want to take care of you.

All right.
You can come here tomorrow and you'll try on the suit.
No, I'm coming here to get it.
In one day you expect to get a suit made to order?
- You advertise 24-hour service.
- For pressing.
For pressing!
For pressing!
For pressing, I'm telling you.
In one day he wants— What's your hurry?
Well, I'm going to Boston by boat.
By boat!
A sailor suit.
I've got a suit...
Wait a minute now.
- Here you are.
- How do you like that?
How much is it?
- $19.50.
- Will you take it?
- I'll take anything to get cut of here.
- Wait a minute.
A bat and ball goes with every sailor suit.
Come.
- Another telegram.
- Oh, thank you, Mike.
- Miss Hughes, you were marvelous.
- Thank you, Mike.
We've waited all our life for this night, Ma.
Oh, it's from Buddy!
"Barbara and I will be out front tonight cheering you, knowing that you will cheers us too, because today we were married."
Oh!
Oh, my God!
Oh, don't...
Don't be like that, Gloria.
Mama!
What will I do?
What will I do now?
Gee, Gloria sure got her wish.
She certainly is glorified tonight.
You lock pretty glorified yourself, honey.
Not glorified, but happy.
- Let's stop those tears.
- I'll try, Mother.

- Thirty thousand.
- From the Russians?
No, from the French.
From the Russians we capture more than that every day.
Mr Postman.
War is war and schnapps is schnapps, and business must go on.
You didn't leave the mail yet this morning.
Ah, I'm sorry, Mr Meyer.
Hello, Himmelstoss.
Anything for us today?
- No, no, Master Peter.
- Oh, there must be something. Here, here you go, young rascal.
There. This is the last mail I deliver anyhow.
- What? - Tomorrow I change uniforms.
- You're going in the army?
- Yes, I was called. I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.
I'll be called myself, if it doesn't end in a few months.
- It will, though. - I'm sure you're right, Mr Meyer.
...defending our country, our fatherland.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do:
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country.
But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that in one of the schools... the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here... you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet... that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers, fathers... that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish rather than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience... such a bad thing for a boy?
Is the honour of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it... is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy... and let acclaim come when it would.
But to be foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will be a quick war... that there will be few losses.
But if losses there must be... then let us remember the Latin phrase... which must have come to the lips of many a Roman... when he stood embattled in a foreign land:
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland. "
Some of you may have ambitions.
I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer... and he has written the first act of a tragedy... which would be a credit to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose... of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller... and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning to your lives.
The field of honour calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Baumer... and I wonder what you are going to do.
- I'll go.
- I want to go.
- Count on me. - Me too.
- I'm ready.
I'm not gonna stay home!
Follow me! Enlist now!
- No more classes!
- No more classes!
- Don't be a quitter!
- Come on, Behn! Stick together.
That's what we've got to do. - Let's all stick together.
- Come on, Behn.
All right.
All right.
- I'll go.
- That's the way! Let's go!
Hey! Let's sing!
Keep in line there, soldiers.
Anything you say, General.
Detail, halt!
Left face!
Get into uniform, ready to report.
I bet you a place like this gets you in good condition.
You have to be for the long marches.
I'm gonna get in the cavalry and ride.
No cavalry for me.
Infantry's where you see the fighting.
Where are all the guns?
That's what I want to know. Oh, you don't get a gun for a long while yet.
If I'm gonna bump off the enemy, I gotta have some practise.
Ow! Bayonet drill.
That's what I want. Ah!
You won a medal that time, Mueller.
You wait. In about a month I'll be covered with 'em.
Say, keep your boots out of my face!
Why, it's an honour to have those boots in your face.
They're the best pair in the army!
My uncle gave 'em to me. Just look at that special imported leather.
Put 'em anyplace you like, except in my face.
Not even a kitchen maid'll look at me in this!
Attention!
Well, for the love of-- It's Himmelstoss!
- So it is. - And all dressed up.
Hello, Himmie.
You didn't think you'd see me again so soon, did you?
- You see my rank?
- Sure. Fall back, then!
- Himmelstoss, we certainly are glad to see you.
- What did you say? - I was going to say--
- Never mind! - What's the matter with you?
- When you address your superior officer, say "sir"!
- Where'd he get such a nice uniform?
- Any mail for us, Himmie?
- Quiet! - My dear fellow, you're shouting.
Ah, come on, Himmelstoss.
We know ya. Take off the false whiskers.
- I believe you mean it!
- You'll find out that I mean it. - But only three days ago you were our postman.
Come back here!
Line up!
Line up! Get in some kind of a line!
All of you!
Hmm.
What a pretty sight that is!
Have you never heard of standing in line?
You make a fine mess of it.
Well, I'll have to teach you.
We'll spend the whole day on it, huh?
You may be stupid, but I'm used to that.
And then there'll be plenty of other things too.
Oh, I'll not neglect you.
Hmm.
You're not much to begin with... but I'll do my best.
I see that we have come here with a slight misunderstanding... and we'll correct that, too, won't we, huh?
And the first thing to do is to forget everything you ever knew.
Everything you ever learned, forget!
See?
Forget what you've been and what you think you're going to be.
You're going to be soldiers, and that's all!
I'll take the mother's milk out of you!
I'll make you hard-boiled! I'll make soldiers out of you or kill you!
Now... salute!
A-ten-hut!
Detachment...
lie down! Down!
Head down!
Keep your head down, Baumer!
Detachment... get up!
Now sing!
Do you call that singing?
Detachment, halt!
So... we have no spirit, huh?
We are in no mood for recreation.
Work is what we want.
Good! Then we'll go back to work!
Detachment, lie down!
Keep your head down!
Now sing!
Men... halt!
Order, arms!
Inspection at 3:00.
Oh, that swine! That means we get no time off.
It will take four hours to get ready for inspection.
- I'd like to know what's in his mind.
- He hasn't got any! I'm gonna cut him open sometime and find out!
He's too thick-skinned.
He won't cut. This is the fourth time he's made me disappoint that poor girl.
Arms!
Order, arms!
Left shoulder, arms!
Squad right.
To the right, march! Left, left, left, left.
Column left, march!
Squad, left march!
Forward... march!
Detachment... halt!
Present arms!
Himmelstoss.
Excellent work. They're going up front tomorrow.
- I recommend leave till midnight.
- Very good, sir.
Left, left, left.
Detachment...
Crawl forward!
He spoilt our leave.
I'll never forgive him for that.
- The rat!
- Leave till midnight.
Hmm! It'll take till midnight to dry our clothes.
There goes the filthy ape now.
While we slave over this mud, he goes off to have a few drinks!
Someday I'm going to take one smack at him--just one.
Me too. That's gonna be my life's work from now on.
Why only one? I'm gonna take several.
I might even kick him while he's down.
I feel mean. What are you doing?
You're not going to desert, are you?
What?
Listen. I've got an idea.
Lie down!
Lie down! Crawl forward!
Oh! What?
Ow!
Cover!
Paul, you all right?
Behn!
Come on!
Behn, come on! You fool! Behn!
-Sounds like more replacements coming in.
There's some more, fresh from the turnip patch.
That's me, "I. Westhus,"
and this is where I live.
- I didn't know!
- Well, you know now! Yes.
- It's all right.
- When did we eat last?
- Don't remind me.
- I was fine until you spoke.
- Where are we anyway? I don't know.
The name on the railroad station's been shot off.
There must be something to eat somewhere.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
Sorry to disturb you, Mr Westhus.
Meet Detering. A better farmer never lived.
- And Mr Tjaden.
- Sit down.
You see, we haven't eaten since breakfast.
We thought maybe you could tell us what we ought to do about it. Eat without further delay.
Well, what's funny about that?
This is a bad town to bring an appetite to, soldier.
We've been here since yesterday morning, living on baled hay and razor blades.
We're willing to buy our food.
Where's the canteen? The only canteen in these regions is out looking for supplies.
- Ever hear of Katczinsky?
- Who? Katczinsky.
He's uncanny.
If there's any food within 25 miles, he'll be the one to get it.
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hup!
- Hup!
Attention!
- What is this?
- Volunteers for the future generals' staff.
Sometime I'm gonna take one of you volunteers apart... and find out what makes you leave school and join the army.
At ease.
- Hungry?
- Yes. Wait! Wait a minute!
That's no invitation.
- Can you pay?
- Yeah, sure.
- I have some money. No, not money.
That's just pieces of paper. Have you got any cigarettes, cigars...
- or soap, cognac--
- Yeah, yeah. - Yeah.
- Chewing tobacco?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Kat! Are you crazy?
There ain't enough here for us. I wish you three would get bumped off.
I'm tired of feeding ya for nothing.
Bring everything you got.
- I'm so hungry--
- I'd be glad to give you--
- Come on!
- Kat!
- Hmm?
- You've got the wiring detail tonight.
- Past the graveyard.
- With this bunch?
It's quiet tonight.
You can teach 'em a couple of things. Thanks.
I'd rather do it alone.
- These babes get killed off too fast.
- Well, the lorry's waiting.
Last night I was too hungry to sleep... and tonight, when I get the wrinkles out of my gut, they think up wiring duty.
Come on, get your stuff and let's get out of here.
- Is that any way to drive?
- Let him drive any way he wants.
Suppose he breaks your arm.
You get sent home, don't you? A lot better than havin' a hole in your guts.
If there's any of you left, I'll pick you up in the morning.
Well, if that ride you gave us didn't kill us, nothing will.
- And be on time.
- Huh? - You better wait for your army, Papa.
Here, here.
Don't be so backward.
Listen, children. All we got to do is to string a little wire.
We pick it up at the dump and carry it to where we need it.
Now, you're gonna see some shell fire, and you're gonna be scared, see?
It's all right, boy.
Here.
Never mind.
It's happened to better men than you, and it's happened to me.
When we come back, I'll get you all some nice clean underwear.
That kind of shell you don't have to pay much attention to.
Those big fellas just make a lot of noise and land about five miles behind the line.
The things we've got to watch out for are the light ones.
They don't give you much warning.
They go "waa-aa-aah zing."
And when you hear that, down!
Mother Earth. Press yourselves down upon her.
Bury yourselves deep into her.
Just keep your eyes on me.
When you see me flop, you flop... only try to beat me to it.
Shh-shh.
Now listen. I'll show you how it's done.
Give me a couple of those.
That's to kill the noise.
See that?
- What's that mean?
My eyes!
I'm blind!
I can't see! God! My eyes!
- I can't see!
- I'll go get him--
- Let me--
He's dead.
- He's dead!
- Why did you risk your life bringing' him in?
But it's Behn!
- My friend. - He's a corpse, no matter who it is.
Now, don't any of you ever do that again.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
All right, come on.
Come on.
Hurry up. Make it snappy.
Get your packs and fall in.
Kat, what are we doing?
What's happening?
You heard him.
Orders to march.
- But where to, for the love of--
And this one is gonna last a long time.
Come on.
Company, attention!
Shoulder arms!
March right, march!
Take your hands off that!
- Queen takes it!
- Well, if you think that's a queen, look again.
Ah, it's a jack.
- Yeah.
It's too noisy!
I can't play.
- I suppose your delicate nerves can't stand it.
That's Oscar.
Look at that!
Don't be so snooty.
You may wish you had this back.
About two more days of this... and this rat-bitten end of a piece of bread's gonna taste like a hunk of fruit cake.
It wouldn't-
- It wouldn't last two more days, would it? Didn't I tell you this was gonna be a bad one?
I don't mind the days so much.
It's keeping up all night-- Ah, two more days makes a week, kid.
Then you can say you've been under fire!
You're not scared, are you? No. I was just asking.
- Wanna play some more?
- Sure. - All right.
You better get your boot back before Oscar eats that!
The kid's all right.
Behn!
Behn.
Yeah, yeah.
Let him sleep. He's dreamin'. Oh, God.
Can't you see it's Behn? He didn't want to come to war!
No, no.
It isn't Behn. It isn't Behn!
It's Kemmerick!
It's me!
Shut up, will you?
It's bad enough in here as it is.
Every-- Everything's all right, Franz.
You're just dreaming, I guess.
- Attention!
- At ease.
The men in two more dugouts gone.
However, we'll do our best to get some food up here by evening.
Stop!
Let me out!
- What did you do that for?
- Shut up! Grab him. - No.
You all right now?
I think so.
I couldn't hold out much longer.
- Oh, God, it's Franz!
No, don't.
He's been hit in the stomach.
He can't have anything to drink. Get a stretcher.
Where'd they get you, Kemmerick?
- Here it is, sir.
All right.
- Is it serious, sir?
- Tell the others he's all right.
If we're going to fight, why don't we fight?
Why don't we go over?
You could go crazy staying here.
Let's do something! - Let's go after 'em!
- Sit down!
If that cook of ours had any guts, he'd try to bring something through.
He's so far behind the lines he can't hear the shooting!
- Here's Kat. Get anything?
- Any luck? - We'll have to split this up among us.
- Something to eat!
We need butter too. Yes. And dessert.
And a feather bed to sleep on.
- Rats! - Rats!
Get out of the way!
- That's enough, boys.
What's that? Come on!
Grab your rifles!
Come on!
- Get your grenades here.
Hurry up.
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go! Let's go!
We can't hold this position.
Back to your own lines!
- Fill it up.
- And hurry up. I've got other things to do.
I've been waiting for this for three weeks.
When they all get here.
What do you want?
Beans, you homely-lookin' son of a frog's leg.
- What do you think I want?
Shut up! I'll feed you when you're all here.
- We're all here now.
- Only half the company's here.
Get the rest. Wake 'em up.
I wish I could wake 'em up.
There's 80 of us left.
The rest is in dressing stations or pushing' up daisies.
Eighty?
And I cooked for 150!
All right.
We'll have enough for once. Come on.
Dish out!
You mean you've cooked beans for 150... and you've got bread for 150... and sausage for 150, and tobacco for 150?
Everything!
It's all wrong. I should have been notified.
What a feast!
Everyone gets two issues.
- Get back in line!
Get back in line!
- Oh, no! That won't do.
I can't give 80 men what's meant for 150.
Listen.
You drew rations for the 2nd Company, didn't ya?
Yeah.
All right. We're the 2nd Company.
I've got my orders.
- Kat's right. - We're the 2nd Company.
And if only half of us get back, that's our good luck.
- Come on.
Dish it out.
- Come on! - No!
- Hey!
You're the yellowest baboon that ever drew a cook wagon... and you're scared-- it shows.
All we want to hear out of you is one more little yip... and we'll cut ya up and eat ya raw.
Why, you keep your kitchen so far back of the lines... we never get anything to eat until it's cold and we're asleep!
Now, you low-down rat, get out... or we wreck the joint!
- Come on! Give us--
- Attention!
At ease.
What's goin' on here?
He's cooked for 150, sir, and he only wants to give us half.
- Looks pretty good.
- Yes, sir.
- Serve the whole issue.
The men can use it.
- Yes, sir. - And bring me a plate too.
- Yes, sir.
Take it all. Take everything. Give 'em honey.
Give 'em what they want.
- Fill it up!
- Don't mind me. - Oh, that's all right.
You know...
I could do with some more beans.
Go help yourself.
It's too far.
- I wonder, when are we going back to the front?
It's enough to take away a man's appetite.
You know, if they're gonna march us in again tomorrow... we ought to go see how Kemmerick is.
- That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.
- How far is the dressing station?
- About two miles. - We could take his things to him.
- Good.
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him... a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
Ah, the French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.
Everybody says it's somebody else.
Well, how do they start a war?
Well, one country offends another.
How could one country offend another? You mean there's a mountain over in Germany gets mad at a field over in France?
Well, stupid, one people offends another.
Oh, if that's it, I shouldn't be here at all.
It don't apply to tramps like you.
Then I can be going home right away.
- Ah, you just try it.
The kaiser and me--
Me and the kaiser felt just alike about this war.
We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English. No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
- No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it.
- No.
Well... it must be doing somebody some good.
- Not me and the kaiser. - I think maybe the kaiser wanted a war.
You leave us out of this!
I don't see that.
The kaiser's got everything he needs.
Well, he never had a war before. Every full-grown emperor needs one war to make him famous.
- Why, that's history.
- Yeah, generals too. They need war. And manufacturers.
They get rich. I think it's more a kind of fever.
Nobody wants it in particular... and then all at once, there it is.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
Whenever there's a big war comin' on...
- you should rope off a big field--
- And sell tickets. Yeah.
And on the big day... you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals... put them in the centre dressed in their underpants... and let 'em fight it out with clubs.
The best country wins.
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
- Something interesting might happen on the way. - Might cheer him up.
Boys, me and the kaiser want you back in time to march tomorrow.
Don't forget.
- We'll be back.
There he is.
- Hello, Kemmerick.
- How are ya? - How's it going?
- How are things going?
- Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
-Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost so much blood.
-Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
- Oh, no. You must eat.
That's the main thing. It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been--
I know what you mean!
I know! I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
Why- - Why didn't they tell me?
- Franz!
Franz! - Now I can't walk any more!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
You can go home. Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See? Put 'em under the bed.
That's a marvellous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz, why don't you leave 'em with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em. My boots give me blister after blister--
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go. Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
- We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye.
- Bye. - Goodbye, Franz.
You think he'll last till after mess?
- I don't think--
Boys, you go along. I'll see you later.
Goodbye. All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only- - Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller. We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz!
Don't talk nonsense. Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh- - Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.
O God... this is Franz Kemmerick... only 19 years old.
He doesn't want to die.
Please don't let him die.
Paul.
- Paul.
Take my boots home for Mueller.
Oh, no, Franz, no.
And if...
Paul... you find my watch, send it home.
Franz!
Doctor.
Doctor! Doctor!
Doctor! Where's the doctor?
Why isn't there a doctor here?
- Doctor, come quick.
Franz Kemmerick is dying!
- Which one is that? - Amputated leg.
- I've amputated a dozen legs today.
- Bed 26, sir. - You see to it. I'm due in the operating room.
One operation after another since 5:00 this morning.
Sixteen dead today, and yours is the 17th.
There'll probably be 20 by the morning.
You're lookin' good.
What's your hurry? Hey! I'll bet he stole those boots!
- I got it, Kat.
- Hmm?
Listen: "The sum of an arithmetic series... is S = A + L x N over 2."
- Interesting, isn't it?
- What do you wanna learn that stuff for?
One day you'll stop a bullet and it'll all be worthless.
- I get a lot of fun out of it.
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then-- then I came outside... and it felt-- it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things... like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know-- girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started. I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And-- And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.
It's a good invention just the same.
If you crack each separate louse, think of all the energy you use up.
Burned to death.
- How was patrol? Bad? - Must've been terrible if they had time to gather the harvest.
We passed a cherry tree and when he saw it, he went crazy.
I could hardly drag him away. It was... beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
When they're in full blossom... from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.
So white.
- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent back as a farmer. A woman can't run a farm alone.
That's no good, you know?
No matter how hard she works.
Harvest coming on again.
What's the matter with him?
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm. We'd all like to get back home.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?
Get drunk and look for women!
I'd go looking for a Cinderella... that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody'd see me for two weeks.
I'll go back to the peat fields... and those pleasant hours in the beer gardens.
And there's worse things than cobbling too.
Look.
I oughta give you a kick in the backside for startin' all this.
It's all right for all you to talk. You've got something to go back to:
wives, children, jobs.
But what about us?
What have we got to go back to?
- School?
- Why not? You know everything already?
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
- You can't peel that off easily.
- They never taught us anything really useful like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell ya.
Take our class.
Out of 20, three are officers... nine dead...
Mueller and three others wounded... and one in the madhouse.
We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it.
Hurry up! Get in there!
Himmelstoss!
What's up?
- What are you, crazy?
- It's Himmelstoss! Himmelstoss? There is justice in the army!
Well, well. So, we are all here, huh?
- A bit longer than you, Himmie.
- Since when have we become so familiar?
Stand up and click your heels together!
All of you!
- Take a running jump at yourself!
- Who's your friend?
Would somebody get General Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?
I command you as your superior officer!
- Do you want to be court-martialled?
- I do!
There's going to be a big attack tonight and I'd just love to get out of it.
Will you obey my orders?
Kiss my butt!
It isn't customary to ask for salutes here.
But I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before.
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun. This time you're going with us.
If any of us stops a bullet, before we die... we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly...
-"Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?"
- You'll--
There it is.
Right on time. Better get ready, boys.
I'm wounded!
I'm wounded!
It's just a scratch, you yellow rat! Up!
Get out with the others!
- Up! - No!
No! No! You yellow rat!
Stinking yellow rat!
Let the others do it, eh? Get up!
Get up!
- Aa-aah! - Get up!
Forward!
- Get out here! - Command... was forward.
Command was forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Counter-attack.
I want to help you.
Stop that! Stop it, stop it.
I can bear the rest of it.
Why do you take so long dying?
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
You won't die. Oh, no. You won't die.
They're only little wounds. You'll get home.
You'll be all right.
You know I can't run away.
I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.
If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it.
When you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you.
But you'rejust a man like me, and I killed you.
Forgive me, comrade.
Oh, no.
You're better off than I am.
You're through. They can't do any more to you now.
Oh, God, why did they do this to us?
We only wanted to live, you and I.
Why should they send us out to fight each other?
If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms... you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert.
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can. I'll write to your parents.
I'll write to your wife.
I promise she'll not want for anything.
I'll help her and your parents too.
Only forgive me.
Forgive me! Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Terrible thing happened yesterday.
I stabbed a man.
With my own hands, stabbed him. I know how it is.
Your first time. Never mind.
The stretcher-bearers will find him. - He's dead.
I watched him die.
- You couldn't do anything about it. We have to kill.
We can't help it. That's what we are here for. Uh-
- Look there, for instance. Hah!
That got him. You should've seen how he leaped in the air.
That fellow had to shoot with us for today with three hits.
If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his buttonhole this evening.
Don't you lose any more sleep over this business.
Maybe it was 'cause I was out there with him so long, huh?
Sure, that's it. After all, war is war.
March!
Forward!
Quick there!
Company... halt!
Uncommissioned officers, enlisted men... dismissed!
Hooray! Come on!
- Give me your best sausage.
Give me a beer.
One, two, three!
Hey, come on.
Hey, get out of here!
Oh, ho ho!
Here's hoping we get falling-down drunk tonight.
I'd forgotten there were girls like that.
There aren't. Just look at those thin, little shoes.
She couldn't march many miles in those.
Don't speak about marching.
A thousand pardons.
- How old do you think she is?
- Oh, about 22.
No, that'd make her older than us.
She's... 17.
A girl like that.
We wouldn't have much of a chance with him around.
- We could take a bath, wash our clothes--
- All right.
and I might even go so far as to get deloused. Wait a minute!
She's a long way from here now. Look at the date.
May, 1917.
- Four months ago.
- That's true. Well, here's to her anyway.
Here's to 'em all, everywhere.
Albert...
- we might as well wash up anyway.
Personally, I like 'em bigger around.
This conversation was on a high moral plane up to now.
Now we do need a bath.
- A bath?
- For what? Hm. You wouldn't understand.
This water is freezing.
This romantic business has gone too far.
- Ahh, but think of her beautiful eyes!
- Oh!
Oh, and her hair.
- Here we are!
- We're not gonna miss a thing! - Go away!
- What are you doing here?
- Bathing!
They tell me there's some people in this world takes a bath every week!
Mademoiselle, you want to swim?
Aw, baby!
Aw, no, girls!
Aw, mama!
- Please don't go!
Whoo-hoo!
Food!
Whoo-hoo!
Halt!
You know you're forbidden to cross. You fellows stay on this side or you'll get yourselves in a lot of trouble.
- What are they jabbering' about?
- They want us to swing over tonight.
They're expecting us.
- That's fine! - We'll do it!
- That blonde's crazy about me.
- But there's four of us and only three of them.
- I was the one that stopped 'em!
That blonde piece of work is mine.
You three fight for what's left. Fight's the word.
All's fair in love and war.
Huh? What do you mean?
What're you gonna do? You'll find out.
Au revoir!
- C'est moi, blondie!
- Bon ami! Bon ami! Vos camarades!
Vos camarades!
Ooh!
Not only modest, but dashing!
- It might've been made for me.
- An officer's coat.
We're calling distinguished company.
Merci.
Have another little drink, comrade.
Is this your birthday or mine?
Why? You've been buying me drink after drink for two hours.
What I'm tryin' to figure out is why.
Why?
Why? Oh!
Ha-ha! Oh.
I-It's just that the boys... told me to amuse you for a little while.
Oh, nice boys.
Yeah!
Ehh... heh.
Huh? I've been betrayed!
Yeah, you certainly have.
Take that for a minute!
Ahh.
It's too loud.
Pauvre garçon.
Pauvre petit garçon.
- Darling.
- Quoi?
- What's your name?
-Je ne comprends pas. Name.
How do you say name?
Georgette?
Camille? Oh, mon nom.
Suzanne.
Suzanne.
Et toi?
Quel est ton nom?
- Paul. - Paul.
C'est un joli nom. Suzanne, I wish I could tell you something.
- I wish you could understand.
- Oh, non, non. I faut pas-- Darling, I'll never see you again.
I know that.
And I wouldn't even know you if I did.
And yet, I'll remember you always.
Toujours.
Oh, if you could only know how different this is from the women we soldiers meet.
Oh, non, non, I faut tout oublier.
C'est cette guerre, cette terrible guerre! No, no, no.
Not the war. You. That's what I'm talking about.
It seems as though all war and terror and grossness... had fallen away from me... like a miracle.
Like something I never believed.
Pauvre garçon.
Call Paul.
Have a look. Nice, new coffins.
I must say, that's a very cheerful preparation for this offensive.
That's very considerate of them. But I don't see any long enough for our comrade Tjaden.
Mind you, I'm not speaking to you, you traitors.
- But no coffin's gonna get me.
- I should say not, heartbreaker.
You'll be thankful if they slip a waterproof sheet...
- around that Aunt Sally of a carcass of yours.
Oh-Oh, my side!
My side.
Catholic hospital, Albert.
They say you always get good food and good treatment.
- We're lucky.
- After that rainy dressing station... and 24 hours on the train, we deserve to have some luck.
I'm Hamacher.
Yeah, that's my name.
I got a crack in the head and they gave me a certificate stating...
"Josef Hamacher is periodically... not responsible for his actions."
And ever since then, Hamacher has been having a grand time.
I hope you boys are not too badly wounded.
The others die off so quickly we don't have time to get acquainted.
You'll get to know us...
Thank you.
I'm sorry, my dear. It's time to go now.
Yes, sister.
Watch.
If they take his clothes away, you've seen the last of him.
- See?
They're taking him to the dying room.
- Dying room?
When you're ready to kick the bucket, they get you out of the way so they can use the bed.
In the corner of the building there's a little room... right next to the morgue!
It's so convenient.
It saves a lot of trouble.
But suppose he gets well?
I've seen a lot of'em go in that dying room... but nobody ever comes back.
Sister.
Sister.
- Is that you ringing, Paul?
- Yes.
- Is something going on?
- I think I have a haemorrhage. The bandage is all wet.
I've been ringing forever and nobody comes.
- I think I'm bleeding. - Sister, get me a sterile dressing and an ice pack.
- Why didn't someone call me?
- He's been ringing. Nobody can walk, Sister.
- Sister, is it bad?
- No.
No, we'll be all right.
What's the matter?
What are you doing? We must rearrange your bandages.
Wh-
- Where are you taking me? To the bandaging ward.
- No, no! I'm not going! I'm staying here!
- Paul!
Paul! - Now, now!
- I'm not going to the dying room!
- We're going to the bandaging ward.
- Why are you taking my clothes? You're lying to me! But I'll come back.
I won't die! I'll come back!
I won't die! I'll come back!
I won't die! I'm not going to die!
Sister Libertine, how is he?
Poor boy. They had to amputate his leg.
Paul.
Paul.
Oh, he is... gone.
Hello. Welcome home, Albert!
- How do you feel, kid?
- All right. But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot hur--
Hamacher.
Did they cut my leg off? Of course not! How many did you have?
Two? You still got 'em!
One, two! Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully. Of course not.
Look.
- I won't be a cripple.
- Now, now.
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm.
- I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
- Albert! - I won't live!
I won't live!
- Yes, you will. Albert!
Albert! Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back. Look, everybody!
I've come back! - Paul! Paul!
- That's not where I'm going. I live over there. Paul, I'm so happy.
Hamacher, I've come back from the dead!
- It's most irregular.
- Albert, get well quickly... so we can go home soon. Never happened before.
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul. Everything will be all right... now.
Oh! Paul!
Paul.
- What's the matter, Paul?
- Nothing. Nothing.
Paul.
Give me your handkerchief.
- Mother?
- Here I am, Paul.
Mother's ill.
- Are you wounded?
- No, Mother.
Here I am cryin' instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother. I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
- I'm making potato cakes.
- Don't let them burn.
Paul... sit down... beside me.
My Paul.
My baby.
I almost forgot, Mother. I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother. Bread, sausage and rice.
- Paul, you've been starving yourself.
- Hmm-mm. Hadn't I better go and tell Father paul's home?
- Paul could watch the things on the stove.
- No, I'm getting up. Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow, I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, Mother.
I'll get your suit.
It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't--
You won't disappear, will you?
No. I'm here.
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
- I remember when you caught that one.
- Yes. And you took it away from me, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honour the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
- Prosit.
I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you.
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh?
Terrible. But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here.
Naturally. But the best for our soldiers all the time.
That's our motto.
The best for our soldiers.
But...
- you must give the Frenchies a good licking!
And, if you boys want to come home, eh... let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St Quentin. You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that everlasting trench warfare!
Smash through the johnnies! And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
Oh! You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details... but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honour.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the lron Cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris! Push on to Paris!
- Right. No, not in Flanders. I'll tell you just where the break should come.
- Here. - The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
From the farms they have gone;
from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward... realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland.
Paul! How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Baumer! Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all I have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war;
one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him-- sturdy and bronze and clear-eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul. Just a word.
Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility.
Tell about it.
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We fight. We try not to be killed;
sometimes we are.
That's all.
No. No, Paul.
I've been there! I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff... making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good is it?
Paul!
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die."
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die" than it is to do it.
- Coward!
-Andit 'seasiertosayitthanto watchit happen.
No! No! Boys,boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say--
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it-- four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay... and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow. I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here!
I'll go back tomorrow!
Sorry.
Mother, you'll catch cold here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you? Yes, Mother.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's--
Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
Yes, Mother. I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if the others say anything--
That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear-- new ones-- in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Goodnight... my son.
Goodnight, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use. I couldn't find anything.
We'll have to eat the sawdust.
Not me! I'll go hungry first. It makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul! How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were. I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust. No joke, either. Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're tryin' to invent somethin' to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
- Messenger dog was wounded.
- He went out to get it.
- Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
- You mean they want us to go on fighting?
- That's what they say. They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is-- Where is Detering?
He got homesick. You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
Where's Kat?
Is he-- Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says:
They're savin' him for the last. - Where is he?
- He's out lookin' for food, something to make soup with.
- Which way? - Down the road about two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
Hello, Paul.
- How's the side?
- Oh, it's all right now.
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been over this country with a rake.
Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul... how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
- What's the matter?
Ohh... I'm no good for back there any more, Kat.
None of us are. We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said, "Go on.
Push on to Paris." My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
It's not home back there any more.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again."
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
There're no lies here. Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of aeroplanes to our one... and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there.
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
Down!
That's another one that missed us.
Come on. Let's go. Wait a minute.
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down. - I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
- Did that get ya, Kat?
Aah, I think it broke my shin.
That's not so bad. Hold it together.
-Just my luck, huh?
- Good luck. That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir!
This war don't end till they really get me.
Now this one--
- Aah.
- Easy, now.
- Hey!
- Easy! Easy!
Come on. I'll take you in.
Easy.
All right.
Well, kid... now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
- Yes, kid. - You give me your address, I'll give you mine.
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried. I was a young recruit then.
Here we are.
All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble.
He's dead. Oh, no.
He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin. He's dead.
Would you like to take his pay book?
- You're not related, are you?
Your deal.
Get his name and number?
Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.
The Blue Angel
Herr Professor!
All these books lying about. And cigar butts...
Well...
It had stopped singing long ago.
"Professor Garbage"
Stop it!
Erztum... Erztum stop it!
Quiet!
Watch out, the old man comes!
Sit down!
Angst... Come here.
Remove this!
- Herr Professor...
- Silence! Go sit down!
Now, gentlemen... Let's see...
What you have learned. Yesterday we left off at...
Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1.
Erztum?
Well?
Well?
To be...
Eh?
To be or not to be...
To be or not to be...
That...
- Zhe...
- Stop! Wrong!
You can't even pronounce the English article.
Repeat after me... The!
Zhe!
The!
Zhe!
The!
Zhe!
The!
Zzzhe!
The!
Zhe!
Open your mouth! - The!
- Zhe!
- The!
- Zhe!
Sit down!
Take out your notebooks.
Now, write this down: Julius Caesar...
What would have happened...
If...
Mark Antony... Had not delivered his funeral eulogy?
" Annie of Tharaw " " My true love of old "
" She is my life " " My good and my gold. "
" Annie of Tharaw " " Her heart once again "
" To me surrendered " " In joy and in pain. "
" Annie of Tharaw " " My riches, my good "
" You are my soul " " My flesh and my blood "
" In all kinds of weather " " If it sleets, if it snows "
" We'll stand by each other " " However it blows. "
" Oppression or illness " " Or sorrow or pain "
" Shall be our true love " " As links to the chain. "
" Annie of Tharaw " " My riches, my good "
" You are my soul " " My flesh and my blood! "
" Just like a palm tree " " Rises straight and tall "
" The more the hail beats " " And the more the rains fall... "
Get up!
Sit down!
We shall see about this!
Inside!
Here, here!
Sit down!
So, you too. My best student!
- Herr Professor! - Be quiet! Aren't you ashamed at all?
- But Herr Professor, I... - Silence!
Look at me!
- Where did you get those postcards?
- I don't know! Don't lie to me. Where are they from?
Someone must have hidden them there.
Really? Expect me to believe that?
They all hate me...
Because I don't go with them at night.
Don't go where?
- The others...
- Out with the truth!
Every night they're at the Blue Angel. There are women, there.
Where?
The Blue Angel.
The Blue Angel?
Go home! You'll hear about this.
" I'm the poshy Lola " " The pet of the 'Saison' "
" I have a pianola " " At home in my 'Salon' "
- " I'm the poshy Lola " - Pork knuckle with sauerkraut! " I'm loved by every man "
" However my pianola " " I don't let anyone touch! "
One bratwurst!
One pilsner here!
- One more pilsner!
- One pilsner! Yessir, one pilsner!
" But if one wants to join me " " Down there, from the Hall "
" I'll bash him in the ribs " " And step on his pedal! "
" Once upon a time "
" A pair of lovers "
" They loved each other "
" A whole year "
" A whole year "
" And even more "
" Their love took no end "
Well, what's going on here? Have you gone silly?
" Children, tonight "
" I'm going to look for one! " " A real man, just a regular man! "
One liverwurst platter!
" Children, tonight "
" I'll take him home with me! " " A real man, just a regular man! "
" A real man, with a heart " " That still glows of love "
" A real man, with real fire "
" Glowing in his eyes " " In short, a real man "
" Who to kiss both will and can " " A real man, just a regular man! "
" Spring is here, sparrows chirp " " Flower blossom's scent "
" I'm in love with a man " " And I don't know yet in which "
" I don't care if he's money " " For it's love that makes me rich! "
" Children, tonight " " I'm going to look for one! "
" A real man, just a regular man! "
" Children, the young ones "
" A real man, with a heart " " That still glows of love "
" A real man, with real fire " " Glowing in his eyes "
" In short, a real man " " Who to kiss both will and can "
" A real man, just a regular man! "
" Men do come in slim and fat " " Tall, and small, and hefty "
" Others may be nice and chic " " Bashful or aggressive "
" How he looks means naught to me" " Someone sure will fill the bill! "
Look here girl! Here sits one!
Over here!
Here is something else!
Feast your eyes on me! Here, Lola, I'm rolling in dough!
" Children, tonight " " I'm going to look for one! "
- " A real man, just a regular man! "
- Yes, the Flying Dutchman!
" Children, the young ones " " A pain are in the neck! "
" A real man, just a regular man! "
" A real man, with a heart " " That still glows of love "
- " A man whose eyes... "
- Stop! Stop!
Don't move! " In short, a real man "
All together! " Children, tonight " " I'm going to look for one! "
" A real man, just a regular man! "
" Children, tonight " " I'll take him home with me "
" A real man, just a regular man! "
" A real man, with a heart " " That still glows of love "
" A real man, with real fire " " Glowing in his eyes "
" In short, a real man " " Who to kiss both will and can "

Well I never... What are you doing in my bedroom?
I presume you are... That is...
The artist... Lola Lola.
Are you by any chance a cop?
You are mistaken, Fräulein.
I am... Dr. Immanuel Rath...
Professor at the local college.
Then you should know to remove your hat in my dressing room.
But what does it mean that it makes money...
- I must think about my work, my dear.
What do you want here, anyway?
I'm here on official business.
You're corrupting my pupils.
Really?
Think I'm running a kindergarten?
Well? Now you say nothing at all.
Man, you're a regular roadblock! ##
Look what crawled in.
18 beers, and they want me to sing!
I cannot stay here. Think of your reputation!
If you're... On your best behavior...
You may stay.
Watch out, Daddy!
I'm dropping my pants.
You! You! I don't want any trouble!
So, how do you like me now?
Never a moment of peace!
Wherever did I put my hat?
I refuse to drink more!
You're here to move the booze!
Think I care about Art?
Drink or pack your bags! - He's just after his cut!
- Shut up! Once and for all, quiet!
Some fiancé you hooked.
He's the schoolboys' Professor.
A Professor?
At the local college.
Dr. Immanuel Rath.
Then we make a team.
- We do? - Art... And Science.
Allow me to introduce myself. Kiepert...
Manager and magician.
Why wasn't I told immediately?
I'm delighted to welcome a local dignitary into our midst.
- I feel...
- Yes, I know... Like at home!
- No, I'm here...
- I can see you're here.
And I'm delighted over it!
Why wasn't I told?
Am I the manager or not?
An old ox is what you are.
Go do your act!
Keep your shirt on.
What a dame!
Herr Professor, you have a impeccable taste.
How dare you! No need to get upset, we're both men.
Leave it to me.
She's... I'm here about my pupils!
You're sheltering them!
Yes! - Me? But we only let in...
- Filthy liar! Liar?
Stop! Who's that?
Come here, you rascal! Stay right there!
Stop! Stop! Stay where you are!
Where've you gone and left your hat now?
Please, take your seats.
He didn't say anything? Nah...
He's afraid of us!
I love you!
Cut that English nonsense.
Now he's hurt. He'll get over it.
You old fool, you ruined the number!
I say a goldfish and you've got a rabbit.
Ah, our student friends are back!
Nothing better to do?
All right, one last time. They'll lose their license.
- He's coming!
- Who? Garbage!
No, no, no, gentlemen! Not through the hall!
Into the cellar!
" She rubbed herself, full of lust " " But just too hard "
" For now she has a breast "
" In front, behind, on top, below, right and left! " " For now she has a breast "
- " In front, behind, on top... "
- Evening, Herr Professor! What a lovely surprise!
" A gentleman" " A young man"
" Flirted with a sweet, young doll"
" He pulls his hat" " And then he says"
" Miss, I couldn't care less!"
Come right in, Herr Professor!
We were waiting impatiently. " I knew you would return."
I knew you'd be back!
They all come back for me.
My dear Fräulein...
I... ln my haste yesterday instead of my hat...
I took this... Item of clothing.
So you didn't come to see me?
" German People " " Do not sleep "
" Don't go soft " - " And don't waver! "
- Here, let me take your overcoat. " Germans, do not sleep "
Have a seat!
" And if you all move together "
" In front, behind, on top, below, right and left! "
Here, hold this.
Pretty eyes, huh?
Aren't they pretty?
Oh, yes, absolutely. Very, very pretty.
Tonight... You're not here in your official capacity.
I'm afraid that last night I may have...
Behaved somewhat unseemly.
Yes, you did.
Today you're much nicer.
Pardon!
Hey, Herr Professor...
Send me a postcard when you are ready.
You're a sight!
Hold still. If your boys could see you now!
Let's get back to work.
Actually...
Actually you are... A rather handsome man.
God, am I sorry!
Is it so bad? It hurts, yes?
No.
- All better now?
- Yes.
Sorry to intrude, Herr Professor.
Why aren't you drinking in here?
There's a sailor loaded with cash.
I don't care. Send out Guste.
Are you crazy?
Who'd buy her champagne? He wants you!
I won't. - I'm an artist.
- A what?
- An artist.
- What do you make of that?
She has some crazy ideas about her job!
Good evening. Here I am!
Thomas, Captain... Of the three-masted ship Fritz Thomas.
Just sailed in from Calcutta.
Straight from my hold.
Leave me alone! Take and get out of here.
I won't do any such thing.
You miserable villain!
Get out! Is this your daddy?
How dare you molest the lady!
Are you subscribed to the lady?
- But Herr Professor! - Quiet! - White slave trader!
- What? You heard me, out!
Get out!
But Herr Professor! What's got into you?
Miserable pimp!
Who do you think you are, kicking him out?
The man ordered champagne!
I'll pay all! Leave the premises.
Get out!
He called me a white slave trader!
Slave trader! Please, Captain, don't make such a racket.
You'll rouse the cops!
Yessir! The cops!
I'll get the cops, you old crook! You crook!
I'll get the cops!
He tried to murder me!
Bravo! Bravo!
Someone defending me?
Hasn't happened in ages.
I have only done... My duty.
No need to get all worked up, Professor.
Let's have ourselves a drink.
Cheers!
May I propose... A toast to you... My dear lady.
Forgive me, Herr Professor, but... The police are here.
The police?
- The police? - They mustn't find you.
I've nothing to fear.
Not you, maybe, but we do!
You'd better lay low, Herr Professor.
I've nothing to fear... From the authorities.
We could rent rooms down there.
He lunged at me like a madman.
Yes, he's drunk!
Just hold on...
This man claims he was assaulted here.
He tried to murder me!
To murder me!
Who did? Well, who then?
Where'd the hoodlum disappear?
Him, Officer! He attacked me on stage. Just keep out of this.
Where'd you hide him, you crook?
How should I know, you old boozer?
I wasn't even there.
Come on, out you come!
Little rascals, I finally caught you!
The game is up! I caught you!
Get going! It's all over now!
Come on! You too! All of you!
You hooligans! Hooligans!
There he is! He tried to murder me, Officer!
He's the one!
- Sorry, Herr Professor.
- He called me a slave trader! Quiet!
Sorry, sir. This man wants me to press charges.
Go ahead, press charges. I'll press charges against him!
- What do you mean? Arrest the lout!
- Pipe down!
- No one's going to silence me!
- We'll see.
Off to the station with you.
He tried to murder me!
He called me a slave trader!
I presume you're aware...
That this incident will have consequences.
Take that cigarette out of your mouth.
I said take that cigarette out of your mouth.
The truth! What do you come here for?
The same as you, Herr Professor.
Get out! Out!
You'll regret this!
Well done, Prof.
Here, down the trap she goes.
- Garbage! - Garbage! Garbage!
You miserable rascals! You haven't heard the last of this!
You haven't heard...
You haven't heard... You haven't...
Goodness, what's wrong, Herr Professor?
I'll be all right.
I'll be... I feel better already.
Those lousy bums!
Some profession you chose.
It's not good to get so worked up.
Damn that bell!
What's going on here? You going to order?
The place is half empty!
Stop complaining!
Who brought the skipper in?
Get going, wiggle your fannies.
Come out with us, Herr Professor!
A little music will put you right.
You landed a few good punches...
But I'm not the kind... Who bears a grudge.
Herr Professor... I'm going to give you...
A little shot...
From my personal medicine cabinet.
Down the hatch!
Do you really think this will help?
Sure, it'll set you back on your feet. Yes?
Good?
Yes!
Now you can show your face.
- Why?
- Come with me. - Where?
- The reserved seats. - What for?
- To hear Lola sing. - Lola? - Yes!
Yes...

To introduce our guest of honor for the night.
Dr. Immanuel Rath!
Professor...
Who gives a damn?

Herr Professor! The breakfast!
Morning, Immanuel!
Good morning.
Breakfast, Herr Professor.
Come now, darling, the coffee's getting cold.
There, sit down.
Do you always snore so loud, sweetie?
I'm afraid I may have overindulged last night.
A few bottles of champagne.
You held it just fine.
One?
Two?
Three.
You really are a sweet one!
Good?
Delicious. Extraordinary!
You see? You could have this every day.
There's no reason why not.
After all, I'm not married.
I must get to the school! I must hurry... And get to the school!
Come here!
Stand still! So!
What's this, no Adieu?
Give me a kiss.
Do you love me too?
Yes, yes!
Yes, yes! Good-bye!
You, watch out for the traffic.
Morning, Herr Professor!
Morning.
Sit down!
Herr Professor, it stinks of garbage here!
Garbage! Garbage!
Silence! I'll have you all locked up!
Miserable brats!
Leave the classroom. Go to the school yard.
I'll deal with you later.
There's a lot I can understand.
But to risk one's entire future for that kind of woman?
I beg your pardon, Herr Director.
You are speaking of my future wife!
You can't be serious.
I am completely serious!
I will not hear another word!
I'm very sorry, my dear colleague...
But I'll have to report the matter.
Get your stuff packed.
The train won't wait for you!
Come in!
Hello, Professor! Make yourself useful!
- Why'd I marry you? - I wonder about that too.
Put the flowers in here.
And don't crush them.
Why are you standing there? You know the way!
How nice of you to come say good-bye.
My dear Miss Lola, I...
And such lovely flowers! Thanks!
Don't make such a long face.
I'll be back next year.
My dear Miss Lola, I brought you something else as well.
Would you accept this gift from me?
And at the same time may I ask for your hand?
You want to marry me?
Yes.
God, you're so cute!
I hope, my child...
You are fully aware of the gravity of this moment.
Long may they live! Long may they live!
Three time up!
Long may they live! Long may they live!
Three time up!
Long may they live! Long may they live!
Three time up!
- To your health, Lola! - To this happy day!
Ladies...
My very honorable gentlemen!
- It gives me great pleasure to... - Enough...
Enough of your blather!
Here we go again.
My wedding ceremony was like this, so lovely.
If I had known you then...
Perhaps I'd be the wife of a professor now...
Instead of this conjurer.
That's right, I am a conjurer!
We're in for more of his stupid stunts!
Sit down now!
Would you deny the professor a display of my art?
With your permission... I'll pull a few eggs from under your nose.
As you can see... I have nothing... In my hand!
Here, take it, please! There's something to be proud of.
Watch this, Herr Professor.
Good... Yes? Please!
Honey, hand me my small case.
Ah!
You are a clumsy one.
Why did you bring the postcards?
What a dumb question.
We sell them every night!
As long as I've a penny to my name, they will not be sold!
Well, you never know! We'd better keep them.
" Beware of blonde women "
" They have a certain something "
" You may not see it all at once"
" But whatever it is, it's there "
" A little glance exchange " " Can you indulge in "
" But always keep in mind: " " Beware of the predator! "
" Beware of blonde women "
" They have a certain something! "
How's business?
Two postcards.
This uneducated pack!
Uneducated pack? You're a fine one to talk!
You need a shave, just look at you!
Who'd buy a postcard from you?
Go ahead and stare.
You're not at the college now.
He's right, you know.
You really should shave.
And anyway, what's the idea of calling them...
An "uneducated Pack"?
We make a living off them.
Yes!
We make a living off them... We live.
If you don't like it, go.
Yes, I'll go. I'll go. I'll go.
I can't stand it anymore! I'd rather die like a dog than lead this life another day.
Well then...
Hand me my stockings.
Quick, the curling iron.
It's way too hot!
Well, Professor, how are we today?
Care for a cigar? Havana with a Sumatra wrapper?
Our manager appears to be in high spirits.
I have every reason to be! You should be pleased too.
You're going to be my top attraction!
Don't rib the old guy.
- He hasn't hurt you.
- You stay out of this.
Your husband's a big star. Here...
A contract, confirmed by cable. And where?
At the Blue Angel.
- The Blue Angel?
- Yes! We're returning to your hometown.
We'll hang large posters: Professor Immanuel Rath!
Never! I'll never go back to that city!
You'll change your mind.
I will not change my mind.
Isn't that just like you?
For five years you've lived off this woman.
And now... When you finally can earn a few cents...
Herr Professor says: No, I won't go!
- Leave him alone! - No! - He will go.
- I won't!
We're leaving early tomorrow. That's final.
No, I won't go! Never!
You can ask anything of me...
But not that!
- Don't get all worked up! - No!
I won't do it. - Never!
- No one'll force you. Never!
Goodbye!
Good day, Herr Director! Hello, Herr Director!
You finally made it!
I never thought I'd ever crawl back into this hole.
My place a hole?
She has not changed in the last five years, my wife!
You haven't lost any weight, Herr Director!
You're no slimmer either!
Good day, Herr Director!
- Why should I... - Business is good!
- Glad to hear it.
And you?
Better now, but the last few days...
Terrible!
Goodbye, Herr Generaldirector!
Goodbye, Maestro.
But hopefully not for the next ten years!
This dump is good for catching fish, not for my class act.
Au revoir... Mon petit...
Cochon! Who's that phenomenon?
One week more, and the guy would have bankrupted me.
- Day, Lola!
- Day!
So many handsome guys here in one spot?
Mealtime!
Don't pile the bags in a heap.
How should one unpack? It's unbelievable!
They just dumped them.
- Take out the costumes. - Everything on the earth! - Nice.
- Hanging, hanging!
Don't miss your train!
Man...
What do you know about love? Do not move!
Girls, girls!
Once on stage and not a...
This costs me money, ladies, it costs me money!
Had I hired a piping oil sardine...
Hanni! Here!
Permettez-vous, madame!
Allow me to introduce myself. Mazeppa.
Hans Adalbert Mazeppa, Strength Act!
- And?
- And, I'm staying on! For you!
That's the kind of guy I am, a man of action!
Don't be so hasty!
You have time, right?
I can't wait two hours!
Please, go home quietly. It's sold out.
" Beware of blonde women"

" But always keep in mind: " " Beware of the predator! "

Tonight is crucial... For your whole career.
If all goes well... You'll be a made man.
Scala, in Berlin...
Alhambra, in London... The brush!
Hippodrome, in New York...
Stop it! It'll go to his head.
- This is the Blue Angel!
- You can be a killjoy!
- What can you be, then? - Stop squawking!
- Where's his nose?
- Nose? The nose! You had it!
I had it? You had it, you mean!
I had it, did I?
Don't mind him, Professor.
I know exactly how you feel.
I was just as excited twenty years ago with my first success.
Couldn't you shut up for couple of minutes, yes? Chairs!
Chairs! Even the mayor is here!
The mayor? This I have to see!
Don't be nervous, Herr Professor!
The house is sold out! Everybody's here!
You'll see, your colleagues, your students!
Everyone! What a crowd! Don't get nervous, Herr Professor!
He is quite right! Just stay calm!
Don't let it get to you! Take example from me!
The moment of truth!
Whenever I spy a beautiful dame, I move right in!
That's my trademark!
What's the matter? Why the long face?
Every time I have some fun, you sit there moping.
What's going on here? Stormy weather?
Happens in the best families! Allow me to introduce myself.
Name's Mazeppa, Hans Adalbert Mazeppa...
Strength Act.
What are you waiting for? Go do your slapstick show!
What's up with the old guy?
Well, Herr colleague... A little strong one, what?
Can never do any harm!
The young one is not quite right.
Goodness, what are you doing?
What is it? What's the matter?
Lola, come down here!
I won't go on!
What's up with you? Have you gone crazy?
You can't back out on me a minute before showtime!
What's got into you?
You don't want to go on?
You will go on!
Put on the wig.
What do I hear? He won't go on?
Are you crazy?
Nobody does that to me!
- Get on stage! - Move it, man!
Ladies and gentlemen... I apologize for the slight delay.
A small technical problem.
Someone have a bellyache?
The next number will more than make up for it...
A Conjuring Act... Of truly international class.
As a special part of our performance...
It is my pleasure to introduce to you... As a very special attraction...
A man you all know...
For his long and remarkable pedagogical achievements...
Pedagogical achievements at the local college.
Out with the professor! Send in the Professor!
I can see, ladies and gentlemen, I need say no more.
I won't test your patience any longer.
Please welcome our beloved... Professor Immanuel Rath!
Watch it! Or you'll completely ruin my act! Go!
Go!
Ladies and gentlemen... May I introduce...
August... My apprentice sorcerer.
Herr Conductor? Ladies and gentlemen...
As you can see, I work without props...
Just my two hands and my ten fingers.
What you see here, ladies and gentlemen...
Is an ordinary top hat...
An original British top hat.
There's no double bottom... No secret opening, no trap door.
This top hat, ladies and gentlemen... I shall now place...
On the head of my August...
And will make so bold as to produce...
A live dove... Before your very eyes!
Ladies and gentlemen... I know you're all thinking...
The magician has already set the dove in the hat.
But no...
You are quite mistaken. Please! Empty!
Empty!
All empty!
Here you go.
If I may, here's more proof. A dagger!
Here we go!
One...
Two...
Three...
Four!
Ladies and gentlemen, please, don't be alarmed...
By the sight of this revolver in my right hand!
And now my August is no bird-brained anymore!
This is an outrage! Call the police!
Bravo!
Bravo! Bravo!
Herr Director... I've run out of eggs!
Could you conjure up a few eggs for me?
Of course, Herr Director, with great pleasure.
Ladies and gentlemen... I'll permit myself to produce some eggs...
From the nose of my August...
To conjure up...
Pull yourself together, August!
I mean, you were a Professor!
Ladies and gentlemen, I know you're convinced...
My August already has the eggs under his top hat. Far from it!
One more dove! The eggs!
Lay eggs! Lay eggs!
Where are the eggs? Right away, ladies and gentlemen, right away...
I'm at your service!
One...
Two...
Three...
An egg!
Where's your cock-a-doodle-doo, man? A genuine... Hen's egg.
See...
Lay more eggs! Lay more eggs! Lay more eggs!
- Quiet here!
- Lay more eggs!
If you don't crow, I'll kill you!
Once again! One! Two!
Three! An egg... An authentic, genuine hen's egg!
Go on! Crow!
Crow a cock-a-doodle-doo! Cock-a-doodle-doo! Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Man, if you don't crow this time, I'll kill you!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Go on, do your cock-a-doodle-doo!
What is it? I haven't done anything yet!
What do you want from me?
Let me go! No!
Help it out a little bit here!
Come on! Help me!
Get out!
Come here!
You asked for it!
I don't get it, an educated man like you...
All because of some dame!
Get some rest!
I'll have everything...
Back to normal!
" I am, from head to foot "
" Made up of love "
" Because that is my world "

CITY LIGHTS
"To the people of this city we donate this monument; 'Peace and Prosperity'."
Afternoon.
"Did you pick it up, sir ?"
"Wait for your change, sir."
Evening.
"Grandma."
Night.
"Tomorrow the birds will sing."
"Be brave ! Face life !"
"No, I'll end it all !"
"I'm cured. You're my friend for life."
"We'll go home and get warmed up."
"Any news ?"
"Only that your wife sent for her baggage, sir."
"Good !"
"Here's to our friendship --"
"No, I'll live !"
"James - the Rolls-Royce.
We'll burn up the town !"
Early morning;
homeward bound.
"Be careful how you're driving."
"Am I driving ?"
"I like your car."
"Then keep it, it's yours."
"Where's my friend ?"
"Let him in, he's my guest !"
"Let's buy some flowers."
"Here's ten dollars."
"I haven't any change, sir."
"James !"
"Take these inside;
I'll be right back."
"Thank you for your kindness, sir."
"May I see you home again ?"
"Whenever you wish, sir."
The sober dawn awakens a different man.
"I'm out to everybody !"
"Whoever he is, get rid of him !"
"-- and then he brought me home in his car."
"He must be wealthy."
"Yes, but he's more than that."
That afternoon.
"My friend !"
"Come on home, I'll give you a swell party."
The party.
The morning after.
"I'm sailing at noon, so hurry !"
"She has a fever and needs careful attention."
Determined to help the girl, he found work.

GIRLS IN UNIFORM
Have we not been announced?
I'm Miss von Kesten. Don't get up, Your Excellency.
I'll take a seat too. Please.
I have to inform you that the headmistress is terribly sorry, but she is indisposed.
So sorry to hear.
The headmistress would have loved to welcome you herself.
-She is asking to please forgive her.
-But of course.
Let the headmistress know that I regret it as well.
I would have loved to introduce our little niece myself.
Manuela? Please curtsey.
How do you do?
Well, you are pretty big for 14.
Fourteen and a half.
How are her studies going?
Her education to date leaves much to be desired.
She's a half-orphan.
My brother-in-law is certainly a good man...
But you know what those army officers are like.
They have no idea how to educate a young girl.
My poor sister passed too soon.
She's very sensitive.
And she is always scatterbrained.
There, there, now. There's no harm in a few tears.
It will pass as soon as you feel more comfortable here.
Manuela, pull yourself together.
A soldier's daughter crying!
Hello.
You're not allowed to go up.
-Why not?
-Come down. It's the rules.
How do you do?
My name is Margo von Rasso. I will look after you.
So, Manuela...
Keep your head up.
Make your father proud.
Work hard and do as you're told, so you bring home a good report card.
I don't want you to spoil my plans for your future.
-Do you promise?
-Of course, Auntie.
Well, then give me a kiss.
-Adieu, Miss von Kesten.
-Goodbye, Your Excellency.
And thank you for everything you'll do for this girl.
You are more than welcome.
Be good, Manuela.
Come on, this way.
The big staircase is only for the headmistress and guests.
Let's first try on your uniform.
The wardrobe mistress is expecting you. It's on top, on the fourth floor.
I'll show you everything else.
-But you have to do things for me too.
-Of course, Marga.
In the morning, you'll bring me water for washing.
That's only the seventh graders, the little ones.
Ana' everyone shouts As loud as he can
When do we get something to eat?
I'm awfully hungry.
-That's the new girl.
-How do you do?
-I'm Oda von Oldersleben.
-How do you do?
I'm Barbara von Beckendorf.
-Hello.
-I'm Ilse von Treischke.
Do you know what dorm you're in?
-Marga says I'm in Miss von Bernburg's. -Wow!
Me too.
Well, don't fall in love.
But Why?
Almost all the girls here have a crush on Miss von Bernburg.
Oh, God!
When I finally don't have to listen to that anymore.
"Ilse! I envy you!"
"You're in her dormitory!
Oh, gosh..."
"Tell me, is it true that she kisses you at night?"
-Ilse! -Oh, Ilse!
I've had lots of governesses. Crazy ones.
I never really cared.
It's funny with her.
You never know exactly how to take her.
First she throws you a terrible look.
Then, all of a sudden, she is awfully nice.
She's almost a bit creepy, that Bernburg.
Ilse, you're not supposed to just call her Bernburg.
I'll be glad to call her "The Golden One."
Manuela, where are you? Come already.
-Leave her alone.
-Let's go downstairs.
There you are. Come on in.
Come on in.
So you're No. 124. Come on, get undressed.
-What are you doing with my clothes?
-Just calm down, my dear.
In five weeks, if you're good, you'll have a day out and get it back.
Now come over here. Come here, sit in this chair.
Now we'll do your hair.
Oh, please, don't do that.
It's the rules. The hair must be tight.
-But it hurts.
-You'll get used to it.
-The hairpin!
-The hairpins are required too.
Soon you won't feel them. Now come on. Let's get the dress.
Come on.
Put the dress on.
It's too long. We have to pin it up.
But someone has worn this before.
Of course!
What were you thinking, everyone gets a new outfit?
That's not economical. Miss von Kesten would be mad.
We don't allow that kind of luxury.
When a girl leaves, her dress is handed down.
Until it's worn out.
Look! What does that say?
That's a heart.
And letters.
-"E.v.B."
-That stands for Elisabeth von Bernburg.
The girl who wore the dress before...
She must have also had a crush on Miss von Bernburg.
So you're the new one?
Let me take a look.
It suits you.
Turn around.
Your hair needs to be neater. Everything pinned in. There you go.
Why are you shaking?
Are you nervous?
No.
Good.
Manuela, I require total discipline.
You must notify me before leaving the dormitory.
Chatting while changing is strictly forbidden.
Do you understand?
-Yes.
-Good.
Go join the others.
This is your closet.
The key is in the lock. Open it up.
Books are forbidden.
-They must be turned in.
-But why?
-Do you have money?
-Yes, some.
Give it to me.
It's not allowed. They keep it for you.
Manuela, come here.
Nice, right?
Mia put up pictures of Henny Porten.
But I've got Hans Albers.
He has such...
What do you call that again?
What do you call what all the movie stars have?
Sex appeal. Right?
Yeah.
Chocolate must be turned in.
-But I got it from--
-No buts.
-Rules are rules.
-My God, Margo, don't be like that!
That's none of your business! I'm in charge. She's my new student.
My name's Edelgard.
How do you do?
Can I help you with anything?
Yes, please. Come.
What kind of book is that?
That one?
I took it from my uncle's library for the trip.
I haven't read it yet.
Wow, my children!
That's quite something.
-Will you turn it in?
-We won't turn it in.
That's my book!
What's all this?
-Marga?
-Yes, Miss von Kesten.
-Something forbidden?
-Yes, Miss von Kesten.
Take those things away.
Meinhardis, come here.
This is where I enter my good and bad marks.
If I ever find something forbidden in your closet, then you get a bad mark.
And if you have more than five bad marks in four weeks, you won't get your day out.
-Watch out.
-Yes, I will.
Dismissed!
Here are the bills, Headmistress.
Headmistress? Here.
We have to spend less money. The expenses are much too high.
But, Headmistress, we do our best.
The children are already going hungry.
Hungry?
Prussians are raised on hunger.
They are children of soldiers.
And if God is willing, soon again mothers of soldiers.
What we need is discipline and order, not a life of luxury.
So very true, Headmistress, so very true.
Poverty is not sin, poverty ennobles.
This is the true meaning of Prussianism as it once was.
Let the others splurge. They'll regret it.
My favorite food is stuffed roast hare.
And afterwards, our cook makes a coffee cake this thick.
Chocolate-covered cream cake with with extra cream is much better.
Through discipline and hunger. Hunger and discipline.
This will make us great again. Or not at all!
My mom wrote that they've been slaughtering.
So why can't send my mom a whole ham?
No one shall be better off than the other.
Why better?
-If my mom sends a whole ham?
-Many families aren't doing so well.
But I would share my ham with the others.
I don't want it all for myself.
Why are you scraping so much butter off?
Don't blame me. There's only half a pound for 50 girls.
The girls are as meek as lambs.
They're afraid to say anything.
Because of all the order and discipline here.
Yes, yes, we are supposed to be raised on hunger.
Line up!
Hurry!
Line up!
The young Meinhardis, Headmistress.
So...
Line up for prayers!
Forward!
Closer!
Forward!
Closer!
Line up on the left.
We will now sing the first verse of the hymn.
"So take my hands."
So take my hands
And lead me
Until my joyful end
And in all eternity
My wish is not to walk alone
Wherever You will go and stay
I'll be by Your side
I ask you to raise your heads and hands, to repent your sins.
Acknowledge the errors of your ways, and beg forgiveness of your Father in Heaven.
Amen.
I have a few further remarks.
Apparently you have broken several rules.
I heard that letters are being sent without prior approval.
Letters that contain unfounded complaints about the school.
My staff is required to notify me of such disobedience immediately.
The first culprit will be severely punished.
Days out will be canceled and wearing uniform forbidden.
She will march the streets in her own clothes.
Remember that.
Just imagine her naked.
I'm warning you.
I won't send my children to boarding school. You?
I have to think about it.
That's the infantry.
That's the cavalry.
Girls, come over here.
I will show you something.
Take a look at what Marie can do. Come here, Marie!
Watch. Go on, Marie!
Just leave me alone.
-You just want to laugh at me.
-No, Marie.
Now blow really hard, Marie!
What a body, right?
Quiet!
What's all this noise? Hurry up!
Edelgard!
What are you doing?
We were talking about Manuela's mom. She died a long time ago.
And she just told me about it.
Go wash up.
-You don't have a mother?
-No.
Otherwise I wouldn't be here.
Come on now. Is that so terrible?
Come here.
Don't tell yourself that it's awful here.
You haven't gotten used to it yet. You don't know the other girls.
But you can't tell yourself that you'll be unhappy here.
Listen.
You have to tell yourself that you'll be very happy here.
And you have to pray to God every night to ask him for his help.
Yes.
See? You're a pretty reasonable girl.
Now go to bed.
I'll be back to say good night.
Watch!
"Apparently...
you have broken several rules."
"I'm warning you."
Get to bed!
-So? Are you all ready to sleep?
-Yes, Miss von Bernburg.
Every girl gets a smooch.
Wonderful.
Watch, Manuela. I'm up next.
March in a circle.
Step, step, Step.
Right turn.
And step.
Hey, listen. Little Josi Bleicher has a crush on me.
"Dearest, sweetest Mia." Sweetest!
"Let me be with you and sit with you at the table.
Sincerely, your loving little Josi."
-But that's...
-Marga!
-What's this note?
-Nothing.
Let me see.
Go on.
How long do you want me to wait?
I don't want to know about your silly games.
Throw that away and remember once and for all:
Letters are strictly forbidden.
Thank you.
-What happened?
-That was so nice of Miss von Bernburg.
She's just like that. So nice.
I want to be a friend to the girls.
-On equal terms?
-Why not?
How do you maintain authority?
You are their superior.
You must keep your distance.
We must awaken the children's ambition in spiritual matters.
Excellent, Miss von Atems.
-Very important.
-We must be a home for the children.
Their mothers.
We are a facility. There is no room for affinities.
That only leads to infatuation.
Always love.
Discipline is our focus.
The German classics must be cultivated.
Miss von Bernburg, I have long noticed that you don't give very many bad marks.
I don't need to punish the children.
They listen to me and obey.
Is that so?
And Manuela von Meinhardis?
Yes, she is having trouble learning.
But that will change. I find the child charming. Really.
And she learns very well in my class.
Manuela is so ladylike. She learns excellently with me.
She's always well prepared for my lessons too. Better than the rest.
So far, although I say it myself the results of my teachings have always been good.
Yes, exceptionally good.
-What is that supposed to mean?
-Ladies!
Yes, yes, we know.
And we recognize that.
But please don't try to put yourself above your colleagues.
I would never.
The children must trust us.
Sit down.
So...
"Jacob was in a strange land with his father-in-law, Laban... and wanted to return to Canaan with his wife Rachel and Lea and his children."
Who will tell me his story?
-Me, me!
-Marie.
And Jacob lifted up his eyes and behold, Esau came.
That was his brother.
Then he took his many wives.
And the most beautiful, that was Rachel with the little Joseph and the little Benjamin.
-He put her all the way in back.
-But why in back?
Because he was afraid! He had eaten Esau's lentil dish once.
And he didn't know if he was still mad.
Ilse. And the male sheep he put all the way in front.
Esau then approached and was so nice and warmly embraced him.
Jacob dared to come forward and was very happy.
That was a beautiful story. Very good. Take your seat.
How is our work for today? Edelgard, first verse.
"Oh, that I had a thousand tongues and a thousand mouths.
Then would I use them all to sing from the depths of my heart.
Praises for all eternity of what God has done for me."
Well done. Take your seat.
Manuela, second verse.
"Oh, that my voice would carry...
To...
Unprepared again.
Hey. Manuela.
Edelgard, it's just so awful.
I really learned it well, but in front of Miss von Bernburg,
I forget everything.
Manuela, Miss von Bernburg asked to see you.
What does she want from me?
I feel sorry for Miss Manuela.
Sorry for her?
Why, if I may ask?
She must cry a lot at night. Her pillow is always wet.
Oh, no.
She must be homesick.
Now what? I won't be able to say a word.
-It's always like that.
-I feel dizzy.
Come in.
Come here.
Take a look.
Tell me. Did they not send you with new undergarments?
No.
-Where were you before you came?
-At my aunt's.
At your aunt's.
Well. Full of holes.
-My aunt thought it would still do.
-What do you think?
-It won't do anymore.
-I absolutely agree. It won't do.
Well, maybe we can find one for you that's still in one piece.
It might be a little too long, but we can take it in, right?
For me?
That's too good for me.
Silly child.
Well, well. You are such an emotional young girl.
Come on now.
Have a good cry. Sit down.
I'm not unhappy.
I don't even know why I'm crying.
Tell me...
Are you homesick?
Homesick?
No.
But I have to cry sometimes.
And you don't know why?
Or... is there a reason you don't want to share with me?
I can share everything with you. But it's so hard to say.
Why don't you try?
I would very much like to know.
I don't know.
When you say good night to me in the evening and then leave.
And you close the door to your room.
Then I just have to stare at the door through the darkness.
And then I have to get up and go over to you.
But I know I'm not allowed to.
And when I think that I'll have to leave here when I'm older and you'll stay...
-And kiss other children every night...
-What thoughts you have.
I just love you so much.
But you're always so far away. I can't come to your room and talk to you.
-Or hold your hands...
-Now pull yourself together.
Forget that you're a little girl and be a good comrade.
You know that I can't make any exceptions.
The other girls would get jealous.
I often think of you, Manuela.
I'm so glad.
-And you won't cry anymore?
-No.
-Never again.
-Well then.
What is it now?
May I ask you something?
Are you HAPPY?
You can't imagine how wonderful it is to live for you children.
-Well, yes, but...
-Now run downstairs to the others.
And take your garments.
Thank you very much.
Girls! Another one of those Sundays...
I mustn't give up, says my mom.
"The fatherland needs people of steel."
My mom was here too for four years.
Did she forget how awful it is?
-Wow, that's deep!
-Sure is.
Again.
-Marga, come here.
-What are you two doing?
-How deep do you think it is?
-You're so stupid.
You can find out using the law of falling bodies.
How does that work?
Gosh. You count the seconds it takes for something to fall to the bottom.
And then you add the acceleration due to gravity.
Nine comma eight one.
That's cool. Watch.
-I have a bang snap.
-No, don't!
-It'll be too loud!
-Don't worry.
It will make a bang.
Watch.
One...
two...
Girls!
Listen up.
"Dearest parents. Another horrible Sunday.
Why are we even hungrier on Sundays than on other days?
Please send some food. Your loving daughter, Ilse."
-Very nice.
-You know...
If the headmistress finds that letter...
She won't, I'll smuggle it out.
-She's coming.
-Hide it!
Hello, children. Nice Sunday, isn't it?
Oh, yes, very nice.
Are you doing good work?
Let me see.
Very good.
And you?
Also very nice.
Marie, let me see your stockings.
Good.
Also very good.
Let me see your stocking.
Very good. I will give you a good mark for it.
Bye then, children.
Goodbye, Miss von Kesten!
She can't ever see it.
Johanna!
Come here.
Johanna, you have to smuggle out my letter.
But don't get caught.
Here.
But you know better, Miss Ilse.
-I'll take care of it.
-Thanks so much, Johanna.
Bye now. Thank you.
EVENT PROGRAM FOR THE BIRTHDAY OF OUR REVERED HEADMISTRESS
DON CARLOS A TRAGEDY BY FRIEDRICH SCHILLER
"Hold, O Queen!
Long was I sunk in a delusive dream.
I loved, but now I am at last awake."
-Oh, Manuela, you're beautiful.
-You think she'll like me?
-She must like me!
-But of course.
You'll see. Today I will not forget my lines.
"Hold, O Queen!
Long was I sunk in a delusive dream.
I loved, but now I am at last awake."
-"Al| alone, Madam?" -"Madman!"
"With none of your ladies-in-waiting?"
"To what rude boldness my indulgence leads!"
"Our pleasant sojourn in Aranjuez is over now, and yet Your Highness quits these joyous scenes no happier than before."
Ilse! The beard.
Be quiet. Our scene is up now.
"Cannot some letters be discovered?"
"Truly, an intercepted letter from the prince would work with rare effect."
This letter came back because it was insufficiently addressed.
Sender:
Ilse von Westhagen.
"By heaven! I'm all amazement. Compass this.
And I'll bow down to thee, Dominican!"
"Soft!
Someone comes.
'Tis she-- 'Tis she... herself."
Ilse!
Open it.
Give it to me.
"Why are we even hungrier on Sundays than on other days?"
How charming.
Now listen to me.
Children who lie and smuggle letters don't get to be in plays.
Now take off the costume.
-I can't be in the play?
-No.
Fortunately, the letter did not reach its address.
So your parents are spared the grief they must feel for their ungrateful child.
-Ilse!
-Leave me alone.
Stop daydreaming!
"And for the future Carlos stands nearer the throne."
No, child. How often do I have to tell you?
Don't just speak. Declaim!
"And for the future Carlos stands nearer the throne."
Go. You have no talent, child.
Next. Posa?
Let me hear the line that you always get stuck on.
-I can do it now.
-Very well.
Goodness, child! "One pen-stroke now, one motion of your hand..."
"One pen-stroke now, one motion of your hand..."
On your knees!
Open your arms.
-But I thought...
-Don't think, obey.
"Grant us liberty of thought!"
Miss von Atems.
All right. Eboli, come here.
Let me hear your lines.
-"O Carlos, how cruelly you play with me."
-No.
No.
You see, here you demonstrate a woman's power of seduction.
I'll show you. She looks at him, right? Now listen.
"O Carlos, how cruelly you play with me."
Excuse me, Miss von Atems, but it's about to start.
-Good evening, children.
-Good evening, Headmistress.
Take your seats.
I won't leave them, my dear Hans.
Due to internal difficulties, the role of Domingo will be read by Liese von Zieritz.
Our pleasant sojourn in Aranjuez is over now, and yet Your Highness quits these joyous scenes no happier than before.
Come here.
You got yourself into a fine mess.
Yes...
Well, it's not that bad.
I don't get to be in the play either, right?
Now wash up and come downstairs.
My, she's so lovely.
At length the happy moment's come,
Carlos may touch this all-beloved hand.
I hear a step. What boldness!
Arise.
I will not rise. Here will I kneel forever.
Here will I lie enchanted at your feet and grow to the dear ground you tread on.
Madman!
To what rude boldness my indulgence leads!
Know you, it is the queen, your mother, whom you address in such presumptuous strain?
And know that I must die!
Let them come here, and drag me to the scaffold!
A moment spent in paradise like this is not too clearly purchased by a life.
But then your queen?
God...
God!
I'll go.
I will leave you.
Hurry with the lemon.
Have a taste.
What a fine punch you've brewed!
It's a real punch.
It'll make people sick.
You know what the headmistress said?
"She has nice legs, nice legs."
What did Miss von Bernburg say?
It was strange. Bernburg didn't say a single thing the whole time.
But the way she looked at you, you can't even imagine.
Let's be a little quiet now, girls. A little quiet.
I was overall pretty happy with you.
Manuela, that was very good.
For the next time, just remember:
more declamation, less emotion. Well done.
Manuela, I want to tell you something.
You're very talented.
If you work hard, you could be a very good actress.
That makes me so glad, Manuela.
The children performed very well.
A little more, ma'am?
It's a very good exercise for the children to recite Schiller.
Isn't that true?
There's nothing better than our German classics.
The children are so lucky to be here in your charge, Headmistress.
We do our best with the little we have.
Quiet!
Your Majesties, Your Highnesses, Your Excellencies, etc.
I am happy that you managed without my assistance to garner the applause of the staff and their guests.
I congratulate you.
Your helmets, swords and boots were polished to perfection.
And everything else was pretty good too.
It could have just been a bit tighter, tighter, tighter.
But you did a very nice job.
Especially our Don Carlos. Cheers, Manuela!
Cheers!
-To Manuela!
-Cheers!
Whoa, what is this stuff?
Oh, you Rhine maiden... The punch you made is quite something.
It's tasty.
Girls, I like it very much!
Have mine!
I'm already tipsy.
Play something else!
All right. I'll play "Patern."
Yes!
Shall I tell them to be quiet?
Today we let them enjoy themselves.
I think it's good for them to really let their hair down.
-Kesten. Please go check on them.
-Of course.
I was actually a little surprised. Schiller is sometimes rather free.
-I am so happy.
-You're hurting me.
What is that?
"E.v.B. ?
Girls! I want to give a speech.
I love you all.
-Shall I tell you a secret?
-Yes!
She gave me a present. An undergarment.
-And I'm wearing it.
-An undergarment?
She opened her closet and gave me one of her undergarments.
I'm supposed to wear it and think of her.
No, she didn't say that, but she didn't have to, I just know.
I'm so happy because I know for sure, she...
-she loves me.
-But who?
Miss von Bernburg.
I don't care about anything else.
Yes. She is there. She loves me.
I fear nothing.
Yes! Everybody should know!
Long live our beloved Miss von Bernburg!
Has she gone mad?
Long may she live, long, long...
What a scandal!
How awful that Manuela was so drunk.
Mon Dieu, sometimes you just have to drink.
If you're angry or worried...
I understand.
If I were in charge, Manuela would have to leave right away.
Such a child does not deserve to be at our school.
You are right. This is no place for her. She belongs in...
-A reform school.
-Exactly.
Edelgard, have you seen Manuela?
No. I'm not allowed in.
No one is allowed in.
I don't understand what's going on.
I'd advise you to be more careful.
Please, no advice.
-I'm tired of being careful.
-But, ma chère, you wouldn't jeopardize your prospects, would you?
-For this child?
-Maybe yes.
Mon Dieu! But why? Why?
Because I can't bear for her to suffer injustice!
Look out!
Hanoi, I feel so strange.
I can't think straight and... my head really hurts.
Hanoi, how did I get here?
You were completely drunk.
What a mess!
No one is allowed in the hospital ward.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
An embarrassment!
Since this school opened there hasn't been such a scandal.
You're the worst child that has ever been accepted.
If you were younger, you'd get spanked.
Look at me.
Look at me, I said!
It's inconceivable. You were acting like some urchin from the street.
You're bringing shame to the entire school!
-Where is the headmistress?
-Someone like you should be cursed!
Excuse me.
People like you are banned from society.
You'll find out about your punishment later.
I'm sure you know that you sinned against Miss von Bernburg.
She'll never forgive you.
But what did I do?
-What's going on?
-A phone call for the headmistress.
Her Royal Highness is coming this afternoon.
Manuela must be here. No one can be missing.
But she won't be allowed to talk to the others.
-Of course, Headmistress.
-Hurry up with the preparations.
Her Royal Highness is always on time.
Always on time. Of course.
Girls, have you heard?
Headmistress said that Manuela should be cursed!
-My God, poor Manuela!
-Well, she shouldn't have acted out.
Shut up!
You're always so mean to her.
-Leave me alone.
-But it's true!
Did you hear the headmistress yell?
-Have you heard about Manuela?
-So mean!
Quiet!
What is going on here?
Why are you staring at me?
I have an announcement before the princess arrives.
A very sad and unprecedented case of disobedience has occurred.
The headmistress wanted to spare you from all contact with the culprit.
But due to the royal visit, we have to make an exception.
Manuela von Meinhardis will come out of the hospital ward.
The headmistress is counting on your tact!
You are not allowed to associate with her.
Whoever speaks with Manuela will be punished. Understood?
The headmistress doesn't want you to speak with Manuela when she comes down.
The child must be isolated.
I see.
To boycott her?
That's crazy! It's never happened before.
I'll speak to her when she comes down.
-Me too!
-No, don't do it.
-They'll just blame Manuela.
-No!
We should really tell the princess.
That won't help things.
But the princess is the only one who--
Whatever she says, they'll do.
I'll tell her, even if they kick me out.
Forward. Where's Manuela?
Everyone behave.
Now hurry up.
There we go.
Stand still!
Her Royal Highness is here.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon, Miss Gaerschner, how do you do?
-Very well, thank you.
-Miss von Atems.
Ah, Miss von Bernburg. How do you do?
Excellent, thank you.
Mademoiselle Oeuillet. Comment allez-vous?
Je vais bien, Your Highness.
This is our new English teacher, Miss Evans, Your Highness.
I'm going upstairs to watch the parade.
Royalty is always beautiful to see.
-You said you would tell her.
-Yes, I will.
You have to tell her now!
She's coming.
We must tell her!
Quick.
Yes, my child?
It is enchanting to see so many happy children.
Absolutely, Your Highness.
-Beckendorf...
-Yes, my dear. I didn't forget.
Dear Headmistress, I'd like to see the young Beckendorf.
-Beckendorf!
-Beckendorf.
You're the young Beckendorf. How do you like it here?
You love it of course.
-Meinhardis.
-Yes, what is her name?
-Meinhardis.
-Yes, I'd like to see the Meinhardis girl.
-Meinhardis!
-Meinhardis.
I knew your mother. She was a very pious woman.
I hope you try to be like her. You look very pale.
Very pale.
She's not sick, is she, Headmistress?
-No, no, of course not, Your Highness.
-What a charming girl.
Very charming. She will be the pride of the school, I can tell.
And, Headmistress, I would like to speak to you about the nursery school.
May I ask Her Highness upstairs?
Goodbye, children.
First you brag and then you say nothing.
-But why?
-If the headmistress hadn't been there...
Yeah, right. -That wasn't the reason.
-You're a coward.
Not true.
I've just been raised properly!
No, no.
If I didn't have to take the princess in consideration,
I would expel Manuela today.
Excuse me, Headmistress, but I see things differently.
I know Manuela and the other girls better than you.
I'm close to the children. I love them.
-And you give them your garments!
-Manuela doesn't have much.
If the child doesn't bring enough garments, you write to the mother.
She doesn't have a mother.
Edelgard! Come here.
Come in here.
Such disobedience!
I wouldn't have expected you to break the headmistress's rules like that.
I don't know. I'm so worried about Manuela.
She's acting so strange.
I'm going to tell you something, Edelgard.
Your friend doesn't deserve what you're doing for her.
Associating with her only harms you.
Your parents would be very upset if they knew who you chose as a friend.
-Manuela is not a bad person!
-That may be so.
But you know...
I can't really explain, you're too young.
But believe me, you'll thank me one day.
What you call sin, Headmistress, is what I call the spirit of love.
It takes on a thousand forms.
At this age especially, young girls need someone to lean on.
But I'll talk to Manuela to rid her of her exalted ideas.
You call that exalted ideas?
Miss von Bernburg, don't you see that there can be no more contact between you and her?
I forbid you to talk even one word with her!
-What is it?
-I'm so sorry...
-You should be sober now.
-Dearest Miss von Bernburg...
Please, don't make a scene.
Very well then.
Go to my room and wait for me there.
Did you see how pale Manuela was?
Yes, terrible. And when she curtsied, I thought she'd fall.
Manuela!
Child!
Why all the crying?
Pull yourself together.
Don't be so weak. Come sit down.
Now be reasonable, yes?
You know what you did.
What you did to me, you know too.
We don't have to talk about any of that.
You're supposed to be punished.
You're supposed to be locked up.
Not like prison. Just in the isolation room.
Manuela, don't be unfair. The punishment is fairly mild.
Legally they were supposed to expel you.
The headmistress thought about it for a long time.
But this once, mercy shall prevail.
Miss von Bernburg, will I be allowed to visit you?
No, Manuela.
But... But you won't leave me!
It's better for you that way.
I'm supposed to never see you again?
I won't be able to live like that.
But, Manuela... what sort of talk is that?
You shouldn't think such things, let alone speak them.
You must be brought to your senses. You must be cured, whatever it takes.
Cured?
Of what?
You're not allowed to...
love me in that way.
Why?
You have to go now.
I must go.
There's no point in you staying any longer.
I'm going now.
Farewell, dearest Miss von Bernburg.
Manuela!
Miss von Bernburg. I have to speak with you.
-You spoke with Manuela against my orders.
-Yes, Headmistress, I did.
I can answer for it.
I am sure to have acted in your interest.
Girls, what if Manuela harms herself?
That could be a real problem for the headmistress.
Is Manuela with you?
Are they hiding her?
-No. -No.
-But that's not okay!
-We have to help Manuela.
This rebellious spirit comes from you.
I will not permit revolutionary ideas.
Not while I'm in charge here!
I don't care about my job. I know I can't stay.
I can't stand to watch how you turn these children into scared, helpless creatures.
Manuela!
You go this way, I'll go the other way.
Manuela!
-Have you seen her?
-No.
Oh, my God. Did you see Manuela?
No. Where could she be?
Our Father, who art in heaven... hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom, the power... and the glory... forever and ever.
Amen.
Manuela!
-All I hear is "help her."
-We're talking about a human being!
Where is Manuela?
You're leaving the school today.
Manuela!
Manuela! Be still.
Quick, quick.
Did everybody go mad?
What is going on?
-What are the children doing here?
-Manuela wanted to jump!
We must thank God, Headmistress.
The girls have prevented a tragedy that we would have had to bear for the rest of our lives.
That's all I ever get from you, a lot of hard-luck stories.
Come back here, I'll give you an assignment.
It'll be your last interview with the cashier!
Stew.
Stew Smith!
Mr. Conroy.
Give me a crack at that Schuyler story, will you?
If you ever got into a drawing room, you'd step on a sliding rug.
Stew's the only man with brains enough for this.
- Scram!
Did you find Stew?
- Not yet.
- Did you look in...?
- First place I looked.
Not there?
For crying out loud, where is that guy?
Go dig him up.
Stew.
Stew Smith!
There it is...
Pray for me, Gallagher, pray for me.
- Hold everything.
- Stew, your hands are shaking.
- You've been drinking again.
- Come on.
Come on.
Here they come.
- Here they come.
- The boss is getting hoarse.
That's the third one.
If I don't make that last one, I know a sob sister that's gonna get a kick...
Almost had that.
Stew!
Stew Smith!
What?
The screen?
Gallagher!
I made it!
Come over here!
Look, I quit.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
You're always picking on me.
It took three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes and you screw it up in a minute.
Look.
It's not as easy as it look, isn't it?
No wonder you're batty.
Would it be imposing too much if I asked you to do a little work?
Just to sort of break the monotony?
With me, you can always do business.
You know what to do in a drawing room?
It's not knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, okay.
Now listen, we've got a tip.
The Schuylers finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
- Gloria Golden?
- Yeah, little Gloria.
The human cash register.
Got her hooks in the Schuyler kid.
- Right for the first time this year.
- It's only April.
- Get going.
- Get going where?
I can write that story without leaving the office.
And get us into a million-dollar libel suit.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid.
- Any of them, but get it.
- All right.
- Give me a voucher for expenses.
- What expenses?
All you need is carfare to Long Island.
And you better get a shave and a shine.
You're gonna have a tough time getting in there as it is.
I know those bluenoses.
Their ancestors refused to come on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with tourists.
So they swam over.
Dexter Grayson, if you're any kind of a lawyer, you'll get those letters back.
But I keep telling you how difficult it is, Mrs. Schuyler.
The last time I asked her, she made very uncouth noises with her mouth.
I don't know why you're making all this fuss.
I only sent six.
If you had to do it, why didn't you tell it to her instead of writing?
- I couldn't get her on the phone.
- Imbecile!
You should have known better than to write, Romeo.
- I found that out a long time ago.
- I should say you had.
At the rate you two are going we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Splendid, Mother!
Let's hop over to Monte Carlo.
- It's a great place to save a face.
- Oh, shut up.
- What is it, Smythe?
- Pardon me, madam but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
Dexter, go out and tell those ruffians I have nothing to say.
You can't do that.
Leave it to me.
I know how to handle reporters.
All right then, get it over with.
We've decided to see the reporters.
Send the man from The Tribune first.
- Very good.
- Smythe.
Some bicarbonate of soda.
Double-strength.
I know those newsmongers will upset me.
I anticipated it, madam.
The bicarbonate is ready.
Hey, Bingy, you'll find the silverware in the dining room.
Much obliged.
Mr. Grayson has decided to see you.
The gentleman from The Tribune first.
There are no gentlemen on The Tribune.
I understand, sir.
Hey, take it easy, take it easy.
Listen, my boy, no use you hanging around here.
Just buy a Tribune, read it, rewrite, and you use it for your last edition.
Never make the last edition.
It'd take me hours to translate your story into English.
- Is that so?
- I'm afraid.
Take off your hat.
You might make an impression.
Impossible.
Put it on again.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
Hi, folks.
Ain't there a "bless you" in the crowd?
- You're the Tribune man?
- Yeah.
Hello, how are you?
Fine.
Have a seat.
Thanks, I will.
This way.
Oh, boy.
- Fine newspaper, The Tribune.
- Well, I should say.
- I knew your managing editor well.
- Is that so?
Yale. '21, I believe.
We were classmates.
She got a cold?
I got him his job on the paper.
I'm a stockholder, you know.
Is that so?
- One Tribune man to another.
- Yeah.
Right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
That's all right with me.
I won't hold it against you.
- But I'm over here to find out about...
- I know.
I know.
But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Oh, yeah?
However, I've taken the trouble to prepare a little statement.
Here it is.
Here.
So you see how silly that rumor is.
Why, sure.
It's all a lot of hooey.
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
- Thank you very much.
- All right, all right, don't mention it.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
I certainly will.
Well, so long, folks.
Bless you.
- Bless you.
- Thanks.
- So long.
- Smythe, bring in the other reporter.
Yes, sir.
Schuyler's the name, I presume?
Yes, thank you, thank you.
My name is Smith, Stewart Smith.
No relation to John, Joe, trade or mark.
Of course, you can't have everything.
Nice set of Conrads you have there, Mrs. Schuyler.
I was just glancing through this one.
What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Just a habit.
Mr. Schuyler's a bit put out by all these rumors going around.
Rumors?
Rumors?
Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
No breach-of-promise case has been filed.
- It has been settled out of court.
- I see.
Gloria isn't exactly satisfied with the $20,000.
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only 10,000!
And you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel.
So you did give her $10,000?
And there are letters.
Well, that takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
We admit nothing.
However, I've a little statement all prepared.
- A statement?
Good.
- I have it right here.
Fifty bucks, huh?
Don't you know you should never offer a newspaperman more than $2?
If you do, he'll think it's counterfeit.
I don't need $50.
As a matter of fact, I've got $50.
The man from The Tribune seemed satisfied.
Bingy?
Yeah, Bingy would.
He never saw $50 before.
You could have bought him for 6 bits.
Funny thing about Bingy, the more he gets, the more he prints.
He looks stupid, doesn't he?
But, oh, how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
So 10 grand was the amount you gave the gal?
Any other statement you folks would like to make?
- We have nothing more to say.
- Wait.
Don't get excited.
Nothing to worry about.
- A little publicity never hurt anybody.
- Dexter, have him leave immediately.
- I think you'd better go.
- Go, huh?
Wait a minute.
That's a great story:
"Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from the Schuyler mansion..."
Wait a minute.
Don't mind Mother.
- I don't mind her if you don't.
- Anne.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
Decent?
Why, Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
No?
Why not?
Because my name's Schuyler too, and I haven't done a thing.
But I'll have to suffer with Michael, and so will Mother.
Mother's suffering already.
As a special favor to me, you won't print that story, will you?
Please?
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance...
- ... I'd go for a policy in 60 seconds.
- Thank you.
I knew you'd understand.
- May I use your telephone?
- Certainly.
Right over there.
You're all right.
Hello?
Beekman 1300.
Beekman 1300.
That's an unlucky number.
You know that, don't you?
Hello?
Hello, toots.
Is Conroy in?
Let me have Conroy.
He isn't?
Try the washroom, will you?
Say, I interviewed a swell guy the other day.
Einstein.
Swell guy.
A little eccentric, but a swell...
Doesn't wear any garters.
Neither do I, as a matter of fact.
What good are garters...?
Hello, Conroy.
This is Smith talking.
I'm up at the Schuylers.
No, I'm not having tea.
That is, not yet.
Is she beautiful?
Boss, her pictures don't do her justice.
If I were that guy, Ziegfield, I...
Yeah?
Yes, you can see where her beauty comes from.
From her mother.
Wait a minute.
Keep your shirt on.
I'll come to that in a minute.
The Schuylers admit the story is true.
Right.
Now, they gave the gal 10,000 bucks.
But she's got some letters, and she's holding out for more dough.
It looks to me like she's going to get it.
Right, boss.
I'll be right over.
Right.
No, I don't think I can get any pictures now.
All right.
I've met some rotters in my time.
But you're the lowest excuse for a man I've ever had the misfortune to meet.
Well, if you feel that way about it here's your nickel for the phone call.
- How are you?
- Come right in.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Then she walked up to me and put her hand on my shoulder and said:
"Mr. Smith, you wouldn't print that story, would you?"
No, I wouldn't print it.
Read it.
You're going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer from now on.
I should hope not.
I've got to call on her this morning.
- You what?
- Sure.
I must drop in and see the wench.
Her wounds need soothing.
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats?
I thought that story was cold.
You can't go back.
Sure, the story's cold, but I'm not.
I'm sizzling.
Look.
Came the dawn.
Came the dawn.
And with it came love.
Gallagher, you've got to meet her.
She's it.
- And that.
- And those and them.
Well, I've seen her pictures.
I don't think she's so hot.
You don't appreciate her.
Pictures don't do her justice.
She's queenly.
She is queenly, and I know queens.
And has she got herself a nose!
And I know noses too.
That little schnozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you.
And is it cute when she throws that little schnozzle to the high heavens!
Of course, I haven't got a nose.
Sure, you got a nose, Gallagher, but that's different.
Women are different, Gallagher.
You know like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
Stew, I wouldn't be too hard on her.
I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Gallagher, she's the real McCoy.
And the rest of us are truck horses.
There you go, talking like a woman.
- Well?
- Well, you're my pal, aren't you?
Then don't turn female on me.
Pay that check, will you, Gallagher?
I'll give it back to you sometime.
Maybe.
I go.
I go with Conrad in quest of my youth.
Fry those tomatoes, will you, Gallagher?
Now, now, Jeeves.
Now, Jeeves, was that nice?
Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves?
- Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
- The name is Smythe.
Smythe?
Well, well, well.
With a Y, huh?
Congratulations.
What a small world.
Brothers under livery.
- Now, as Smith to Smythe...
- Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
I know.
I know.
I waited outside until she went out.
She's a nice lady.
She's all right, but we don't vibrate well together.
No one's at home, sir.
Now, Jeeves, would you call this no one?
What's wrong?
Mrs. Schuyler left orders, miss, that if this person came again...
- ...
I was to call the police.
- That's a good idea.
Telephone the police.
The number is Spring 3100.
Get a couple of cops over, and we'll have a rubber of bridge.
- You may go, Smythe.
- But I...
Now, the lady said you may go.
- What do you want?
- Well, I tell you.
When I was here, I had one of your books in my hand.
When I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand.
Since I had your book, I thought I'd take it home and read it.
This morning, I put your book in my hand and here's your book in your hand.
- That's considerate of you.
- It was.
I recommend you read that.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Perhaps it would be too heavy for you.
If you'd like something lighter, something with a touch of romance just listen to this.
"Adorable Babykins, does her miss her baby?"
Him sends his bowlful little sweetmeats a billion oceans full of kisses.
- "Bobo is so lonely."
- Just a moment.
I don't see how that trash can possibly concern me.
But you don't know who Bobo is.
And you don't know who Babykins is.
I'm not interested.
Smythe will open the door.
Smythe will open...
But Bobo is your brother Michael.
And of course nobody would ever guess who Babykins is.
Where did you get those letters?
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
I suppose you're going to print them?
No.
Give you another guess.
I don't need another guess.
- It's quite obvious.
- It's obvious, huh?
Will you step into the library?
Sure.
I'll take a chance.
You know, the Indians used to walk like this.
Except the squaw always walked in the back.
You know why that was?
That was in case of an attack from the front.
If the attack was from the rear, she had to depend upon her papoose.
Yes, papooses always had bows and arrows.
Of course, if she wasn't married, then she had to protect her own...
What country is this library in?
Miss Schuyler, how about carfare back to the front door?
What are the initials, Mr...?
Smith, Stewart Smith.
My friends all call me Stew.
It's an injustice, too, because I hold my liquor all right.
Will 5000 be enough?
- For what?
- For the letters, of course.
You shouldn't do that, Miss Schuyler.
That's all right for your lawyer friend but you shouldn't go around thinking you can buy people.
There are your letters.
I don't know how to thank you.
Mother'll be so grateful, she'll probably want to kiss you.
Your mother will want to kiss me?
Give me back my letters.
That's the breaks I get.
It's the mothers that are grateful to me.
You're a peculiar person.
The other day, I pleaded with you not to send in that story...
I know, but that was news.
This is blackmail, and I don't like blackmail.
I won't even pretend you haven't done me a great favor.
I wish there was something I could do for you.
Well, you can make this table a "file...
A little less wide.
There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
I haven't had any lunch.
You got anything in the icebox?
You fool!
After years of research I finally discovered that I was the only guy in the world who hadn't written a play.
Believe it or not, in my spare time, I'm now writing a play.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I haven't figured out the plot yet.
But it's laid in a Siberian village.
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Me?
Most ordinary guy in the world, me.
Only one thing wrong with me.
You don't wear garters.
No.
That's just a symbol of my independence.
I know what's wrong.
I'm colorblind.
That's what's wrong, I'm colorblind.
I've been sitting here for a half-hour looking at you and I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
See, you could do anything with me you wanted to.
Putty.
Just putty, that's me.
But getting back to those eyes of yours...
Would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
Not if you're gonna lose any sleep about it.
Now, how would you like them?
Open like this?
Close them both.
Something tells me I'd better leave.
That's an excellent idea.
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Mrs. Schuyler.
Come right in.
Will you have a slug of tea?
- What is this person doing here?
- Why...
As a matter of fact, I was trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes.
I can't tell whether they're blue or whether they're violet.
- What would you say?
- Don't say it, Mother.
Please.
Mr. Smith came here today to do us a great favor.
Indeed?
Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
- With pleasure, madam.
- Get out of here.
- Mother.
- It's all right, it's all right, Anne.
I can take a hint.
It's subtle, but I get it.
It's all right.
Please go.
I'll explain to Mother.
The caviar was lovely, madam.
You must come over and see us sometime.
- Where were you yesterday?
- Stew and I went for along ride.
Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
Yes, Sing Sing.
Well, he's going to be a different person when I get through with him.
- When you get through with him?
- It'll be an interesting experiment.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Exactly.
Now, remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player.
You don't seem to understand that this one's different.
He has brains.
- But what about me, Anne?
- You?
Don't go serious on me, Dexter.
- Hello, Natalie.
- Hello!
Miss Montgomery, Mr. Stewart Smith.
- Mrs. Eames, Mrs. and Mr. Radcliff.
- How do you do?
Hey!
Who's Anne's new boyfriend?
If my ears don't deceive me, his name is Smith.
Smith!
He can't be one of the brothers.
He hasn't a beard on.
He must have something, or Anne wouldn't have her clutches on him.
Anne, pinch me, will you?
Throw me out of here.
Give me the air.
Throw me out of this joint.
Why should I?
Haven't we been happy?
I know, but you should throw me out.
Because I begin to get goofy ideas and they concern you, Anne.
None of your ideas could be goofy, Stewart, if they concern me.
My name is Smith.
That you seem to have been able to stand for the last month.
I'm white, male and over 21.
I've never been in jail...
That is, not often.
And I prefer Scotch to bourbon.
I hate carrots, I hate peas.
I like black coffee, and I hate garters.
I make 75 bucks a week, and I got 847 bucks in the bank.
And I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
That's because you're too far away, Stew.
Yeah.
All right.
Right.
Yeah, sure.
I got a new dress.
New hat too.
Well, I'll try and get Stew to come with me.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's all right.
Well, you know, he thinks he's stuck on some society gal.
No, it won't last.
It better not last.
What?
I'll be surprised, eh?
Well, listen, if there's any news in that sheet that I haven't thrown in the wastepaper basket, I'll eat it.
Hey, Stew.
Stew Smith!
- Me?
- You double-crossing hound.
Come over here!
If you're gonna kick about those expenses...
- Do you call yourself a reporter?
- It has been alleged, yes.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it nose first.
You're the bright lad that's never been scooped.
- Not on my own beat, no.
- No?
Well, where were you when that happened?
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this?
Holy mackerel!
Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured.
But this...
Marries one of our own reporters, and The Tribune beats us to it.
What do you guys want?
Get back to your desks.
Go back to work.
Don't tell me you were drunk and don't remember.
Or is it one of Bingy's snowstorms?
No.
No, it's true all right, only...
- ...we didn't want it to get in print.
- Why not?
Well, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws.
She wouldn't understand, so we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
What would I care?
You're still working for this paper!
- Or are you?
- Yes, sir.
It's your business to get news.
You had a story in your lap and you let The Tribune scoop us on it.
Making a first-class, grade-A monkey out of me.
Well, if it ever happens again, don't bother about coming back.
That's all.
Thanks for your congratulations.
- How much is she worth?
- Is she good-looking?
Can't a guy get married without all this?
- Gallagher!
Anybody seen Gallagher?
Hello, Stew.
I fooled you.
You thought it was me.
- Hi, Stew.
- Hi, Joe.
Hello, Stew.
Congratulations!
- Have a drink on the house.
- Why, I'm gonna have a lot of drinks.
Wait a minute.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Well, well, well, Gallagher, old pal.
So there you are.
What did you run away for?
- I didn't run away.
- Sure, you ran away.
- Aren't you going to congratulate me?
- Sure.
- I wish you all the luck in the world.
- Thanks, thanks.
- I hope you'll be very happy.
- We'll be happy.
- What's the matter with your eyes?
- It's the smoke.
Joe, a little snifter.
Say, was I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that?
What have you got?
I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher.
Gosh, that is a swell girl.
I want you to meet her.
Who, me?
She wouldn't want to meet me.
I'm just an old load of hay.
Thank you, Joe.
We'll have one of those spaghetti parties down at your house.
Haven't had one in a long time, have we?
Not since you broke into society.
Remember the time you had a party and I dropped spaghetti on the floor and I served it to them anyway?
Remember that?
Yes, Anne would love that.
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights to eat from paper plates?
Anne?
Oh, sure.
Anne would love that.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Now, get this, Gallagher.
Smith, that's the name.
My error.
Hello, chief.
Just because I'm married, there's no reason for that.
Ix-nay, the oss-bay.
Well, what's the Benedict looking for in the newspaper, his lost freedom?
Well, if it isn't old Fagin himself.
Gallagher and myself just came over to do a little work on a story.
Baloney.
Joe, bring me a special.
- Isn't it swell about Stew's marriage?
- Is it?
Well, when are you quitting?
Quitting?
I'm not thinking of quitting.
I take it you don't have to work for a living anymore, Mr. Schuyler.
Now, get this, Conroy.
My name's Smith.
Always was Smith.
Always gonna be Smith.
- Is that so?
- That's so.
Anne Schuyler's in the blue book.
You're not even in the phone book.
Think that one over, sucker.
That doesn't make any difference if they love each other.
He's like a giraffe marrying a monkey.
Listen, you'll never be anything but just the reporter that married the Schuylers' millions.
Stew Smith is dead and buried.
From now on, you'll be just Anne Schuyler's husband.
A rich wife's magnolia.
If you can smoke that without getting sick, you're welcome to it.
- But that's perfectly ridiculous.
- Let me do the talking.
Now, you get this, Conroy.
Anne Schuyler has a lot of dough, all right.
I married her, all right.
But her dough and me?
No connection.
- Just a bird in a gilded cage.
- A what?
You heard me.
A bird in a gilded cage.
You've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids.
Anne and myself are gonna move downtown in a nice little flat.
We're gonna forget all about this social stuff and be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith.
Now, how do you like that?
- And live on your salary, I suppose?
- Live on my salary, yeah.
That is, until I finish writing my play.
- What play?
- My play.
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Siberian bloodhound?
No, it's been all rewritten.
- It's laid in Araby now.
- Araby?
- Sure.
- Araby, my...
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey.
- Let me know when you're quitting.
- I'm not.
- No?
- No.
For he's only a bird In a gilded cage
A beautiful sight to see Tweet-tweet.
Aw, go on and laugh, you hyena.
Don't pay any attention to him.
I ain't paying no attention to him.
You think that guy can get me upset?
Not that mug.
He's a tough mug.
Hard, cynical...
He doesn't know there's any fine things in life, that guy.
A guy can't step out without being called a magnolia.
Stew Smith, a magnolia!
Stew Smith's not gonna hang around and be a Speakeasy rat.
Not me.
I'm gonna step out and mean something in this world.
Watch me.
I'm a lucky guy that I can even be near Anne Schuyler.
I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes and I know it.
Lucky.
I'll say I'm lucky.
Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
- Sure, I think so.
- Sure you would, pal.
A bird in a gilded cage?
How's her family gonna feel about it?
Her family?
Oh, they'll be all right.
I'll bring them around.
Gilded cage...
Besides, I ain't marrying her family.
Stew Smith, ha!
Gilded cage.
That mug.
What does he know?
- I don't know what you need me for.
- You stay right here, Michael.
Someday you'll be head of this family, but thank heaven I shan't be here.
I hope you never have a daughter who gives you gastritis as Anne has me.
Now, Mother.
There's no use in getting excited.
Oh, isn't there?
Sit down.
- Smythe, some bicarbonate, quick.
Double-strength.
If you keep this up, you'll have a breakdown before you go to Europe.
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravaged the family.
I can't imagine what made you do such a thing.
A reporter.
Of all things, a reporter!
A barbarian, who lets his socks come down.
I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer.
Once I get him away from that atmosphere...
- ...and a man named Gallagher.
- Sit down.
Drink hearty, Mother.
Anne.
Anne.
Mr. Grayson.
And you.
Mrs. Schuyler.
Well, what's to be done?
He's here now.
Nobody seems to want to do anything.
Why not ask me?
Perhaps I can offer a suggestion.
Do what about what?
About what?
Your marriage to Anne.
Oh, my marriage to Anne.
We don't want you to go to any trouble about that.
We just want to use your blessings, that's all.
Young man, I want you to know that I object violently to this whole affair.
Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous.
It's done now.
Stewart and I are married.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler.
I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way.
I was in hopes that you would like me.
I'm not the burglar that you think I am.
We're married.
I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up, Mother.
- Stop calling me "Mother"!
- All right, Grandma.
This man's impossible.
I can't talk to him.
Grayson, let's go where we can think.
You see what you've done to me?
Got it too?
Well, who won that round?
Your mother won that round.
That is, she got the last blow in.
I don't feel the way they do.
You're not as bad as everybody thinks.
Well, begin to appreciate me, huh?
- Come upstairs.
I'll give you a little...
- Sure, I'll be right up.
- He's all right.
I like him.
- I'm glad.
He can bend.
Come here, baby.
I haven't seen you for three hours.
You're neglecting me already.
What's the matter?
Something I ate, no doubt.
Egg marks the spot.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
I don't need any new ties.
I've got another tie.
I've got another beside this one.
It's a pip too.
There's only one thing wrong with it.
You know what that is?
It has a little weakness for gravy and once in a while, it leans toward ketchup.
Of course, that's only in its weaker moments.
When you move to my place, I'll show it to you.
- Your place?
- Yeah.
Oh, it's great.
Of course, it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours.
But 'twill serve, milady, 'twill serve.
The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Don't you think it's silly to think of living there when we have this big house?
When we have...
You mean you'd like to have me live here in your house?
Sure.
We can have the whole left wing and be all by ourselves all the time.
We could have the whole left wing?
Would that be room enough for us?
Oh, darling, of course.
There are six rooms and two baths.
If that isn't enough, Mother'll give us the blue room, I think.
Mother would give us the blue room?
You haven't a red room, have you?
Well, bless her heart, wouldn't that be nice?
Six rooms and two baths and a blue room.
I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it.
- Well, but we won't need it, I'm sure.
- I see, we won't need that.
Look, Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Of course I am, Stewart.
Now, let's get this settled.
- You have the cutest nose I've...
- Never mind, never mind.
What kind of a chump do you think I am?
You think I'll live here in your house, on your dough?
What do you think my friends would all say?
Oh, don't be silly.
I'd get the razzing of my life for that.
A bird in a gilded cage, that's what I'd be.
Not me.
Oh, no, not me.
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a cheap flat?
- It isn't cheap.
It's nice.
- Listen, let's not talk about this now.
- I'll do anything you ask me to, but...
- I love that nose.
- Oh, such a sweet nose.
- Whether the nose is sweet or not I'm not gonna live in your house.
You might as well get that straight.
You want me to be happy, don't you?
Then I'm not gonna live in your house.
Mr. Smith, sir.
Mr. Smith, sir.
Mr. Smith, sir, how do you like your bath?
I like my bath all right.
How do you like your bath?
- Who are you?
- I'm your valet, sir.
Dawson is the name, sir.
- You're my what?
- Your valet.
Thank you, thank you.
I'll do that for you sometime.
That's very sweet.
Say, listen, what'd you say the name was?
- Dawson, sir.
- Dawson.
- Was I very drunk last night?
- Drunk, sir?
I must have been plastered if I hired a valet.
But you didn't engage me, sir.
Who did engage you then, if I didn't?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
No, sir.
- What are you doing in here?
- Miss Schuyler...
I mean, Mrs. Smith.
She engaged me this morning, sir.
So Mrs. Smith engaged me a valet?
That's very nice of Mrs. Smith to engage me a valet.
Say, you know, you're nice.
You're all right.
- You'd make a good wife.
- Thank you, sir.
But not for me.
If anybody liked you.
You're a nice fellow.
But I'm sorry, I don't need any valets today.
Oh, but indeed you do, sir, if you don't mind my saying so.
A gentleman's gentleman, as it were.
Someone to draw your bath, lay out your clothes help to dress you.
It's really most essential, sir.
You're trying to tell me I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up.
- Quite, sir.
- I'm sorry.
I appreciate your effort but I don't need anybody to help me button my pants.
I've been buttoning them for 30 years.
I can button them with one hand.
- But, Mr. Smith, please.
- Listen.
You've got a nice face.
You wouldn't want anything to happen to your face, would you?
- No, sir.
- All right.
Outside.
- I beg your pardon?
- Outside.
I think I understand, sir.
You mean you want me to go.
You caught on, didn't you?
See, you're nice and you're smart.
Outside.
Go on, outside.
And don't come back!
- No, sir, no.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- What's this?
- Oh, that's a canary, sir.
That's a canary.
Who brought that in here?
Canary, huh?
Go on, now.
Get that out of here.
Get that out of here!
Yes, sir.
Very good, sir.
A bird.
A bird in a gilded cage.
Get that thing out of here.
Good morning, darling.
Dawson, see that Mr. Smith's clothes go to the cleaners this morning.
Very good, madam.
Hey, who is this mug?
I got a present.
Shut your eyes.
Keep them closed.
I know you're gonna love them.
It's little.
Couldn't be an automobile, could it?
Well, well, well.
Ain't that nice!
Do you like them?
Got my initials on them too.
They're cute.
They're nice little...
- What do you do with them?
- You wear them, of course, silly.
No, no.
Oh, no, no.
Not me.
- I haven't worn these for years.
- I know that.
I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
I love you.
I'll eat spinach for you.
I'll go to the dentist twice a year, I'll wash behind my ears for you.
But I will never wear garters Oh, yes, you will, my dear Oh, yes, you will, my dear You'll wear garters And you'll like it too
I'll wash behind the ears But no, I won't, my dear Oh, yes, you will, my dear Oh, yes, you will, my dear You'll eat spinach But you'll wear garters too
Oh, you can't carry a tune You can't carry a tune
All you are good for Is to sit and spoon, spoon - Oh, no, I won't wear garters
- Oh, yes, you Will too, yes...
Is it real?
- Of course it's real.
- Any diamonds on them?
Must have set him back at least 6 bits.
One just can't wear those and be decent.
- You can if you belong to the 400.
- I wonder what number he is.
Come on, get out, get out!
Didn't you ever see a guy with a pair of garters on before?
What do you suppose he wears them for?
- Can it be to hold his socks up?
- Yes, that's it.
You know, one's hose look horribly untidy when they hang loose-like.
Oh, my dear.
They look ghastly.
They look ghastly.
Come on, get out of here!
- Hey, Stew, your policeman.
- Yeah?
Oh, hello, dear.
Wait just a minute.
Go on, beat it.
Go on, screw!
This is my wife.
- Go ahead.
- Pardon me.
In your respective chapeaux and over your cauliflower ears.
Hello, dear.
It's nearly 6:00, and you know how long it takes you to dress.
But the ambassador is coming at 8 and you've got to be ready by the time he gets here.
I'd like to see Miss Wilson, please.
- Whom shall I say, miss?
- Miss Gallagher of the Post.
- Miss Gallagher of the Post.
- Oh, yes.
- Miss Gallagher?
- Yes.
I'm Miss Wilson, Miss Schuyler's social secretary.
- I'm here in place of our social editor.
- Yes, Miss Ramsey telephoned me.
Well, what would you like to have?
A list of guests.
That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Yes, of course.
I'll get it for you.
Would you like to take a look around?
Yes, thank you.
- It's a lovely dress.
- Thank you.
- Where is Mr. Smith?
- Mr. Smith?
Oh, you mean Anne Schuyler's husband?
He's probably very tired.
He had to meet these people personally tonight.
You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you?
What is it you call him?
The "Cinderella Man"?
- There's the Spanish ambassador.
- You know, he looks like one.
Miss Wilson, Mrs. Smith would like to see you.
Will you excuse me?
Make yourself at home for just a moment.
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays, and I'd like an autograph.
Well, well, well!
If it isn't my old pal!
- Turn around, let's get a look at you.
- There you are.
Well, daughter of the slums, how'd you get out of the ghetto?
Well, I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight.
- I want to see life in the raw.
- You want to see life in the raw?
Well, gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
- I'll have to go some place else.
- No.
Maybe you'd like some well-done butterflies.
Or perhaps some slightly fried pansies or, better still, stuffed shirts.
And every one of them will give you a good, stiff pain in the neck.
Say, who's been tying your tie lately?
It looks rotten.
Gallagher, do you look good!
What have you done to yourself?
What'd you do to your hair?
And where did you get that dress?
- I dyed one and washed the other.
- You dyed one and washed other?
Well, you certainly look good.
Don't turn around now, but there's a very beautiful girl up there...
- ...who seems to be staring at us.
- Staring at us?
- My mistake.
She's glaring.
- She's glaring.
Must be my wife.
It is my wife.
Hi, Anne.
Don't go away, because I'm gonna bring a friend up I want you to meet.
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life.
- This is Gallagher.
- Gallagher?
Sure, my pal on the paper.
She's subbing for the society editor tonight.
Oh, yes, of course.
How do you do?
- Gallagher, Mrs. Smith.
- How do you do?
You failed to mention that Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Gallagher?
Yes, in fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
I failed?
Well, that's funny.
- Isn't that funny?
- Yes, isn't it?
Well, we never look at Gallagher as a girl.
No?
What do you look upon her as?
Well, down at the office, we all just...
Gallagher, that's all.
You see, they all consider me just as one of the boys.
- Indeed?
How interesting.
- Yes, isn't it?
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any detail you need.
Well, thank you.
I'll go and look for her at once.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
- Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
Goodbye, Stew.
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne.
After all, Gallagher is my friend.
The least you can do is be courteous to her.
- I thought I was very charming.
- You did?
That's a lot of hooey.
- I'll go and apologize.
- Oh, Stewart, please.
I'm sorry, Gallagher.
Really, I am sorry.
Oh, that's all right, Stew.
Forget it.
As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
Oh, no.
No.
Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.
It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Yes.
- Hello there, Meadows.
- Who is it you wish to see, sir?
I wanna see Stew Smith.
Oh, excuse me.
I mean, Mr. Smith.
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged.
- We have a reception here...
- Oh, a party!
Great!
Jolly times and merry pranks, that's me.
I'm a guy who loves parties.
You know what...?
Beautiful pair of shoulders.
Listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy and tell Stew Smith I've gotta see him, because if you don't my whole family's gonna die.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir.
Have a seat.
Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.
Pardon me, sir, but I've heard that one before.
Excuse me, want to be sure he doesn't take away any of the vases.
Well, well, well.
So my little pal Gallagher is a gal, huh?
That's just to give you an idea that I know how to treat a gal.
Get fresh with me and I'll sock you in that little nose of yours.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
What's the matter?
A little clumsy to get in your pocket?
I was just looking at it.
Pretty, ain't it?
I was looking for the price tag.
- What do you want?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.
I wanted to see how the newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Oh, boy, I'd love it.
- How's that?
- Not bad.
Not good, but not bad.
You ought to be able to fool almost anybody.
Well, have you seen enough, or would you like a photograph?
A photograph?
What's the matter?
Hasn't Mama had you done in oils yet?
Now, get this, mug!
You've got the kind of chin I'd just love to touch.
And if you don't get out of here, I'm gonna hang one right on it.
Take it easy, Dempsey.
Just relax.
Relax and open your pores.
- I bring a message from Garcia.
- Yeah?
Yeah, the boss sent me over to offer you a job.
- He wants you for a daily column.
- Go on.
It's all right.
You can write your own ticket. 150 bucks a week.
- All right, I'll bite.
What's the catch?
- No catch.
This is on the up-and-up.
Of course, all you have to do is just sign the article:
"By Anne Schuyler's husband."
Well, how does the old Cinderella Man feel about that?
Well bowled, sir.
Very neat.
That's what I think of it, Bingy.
- Smythe, the gentlemen is leaving.
- Yes, sir.
Good morning, Mother.
Didn't I tell you he'd be marvelous?
Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
I was so worried he'd knock something over.
I must have acted like an idiot.
What does it say about the reception last night?
The usual thing.
Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception...
- ...wore the same blah, blah things.
- Stop it, Anne.
You're behaving like who you're married to.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother.
He was all right last night, wasn't he?
I told you not to worry about him.
It was a miracle.
The man was ill or something.
- Mother!
- Look!
Look!
The front page!
I knew it, I knew it.
I felt it in my bones.
Did you see the papers? "Cinderella Man grows hair on chest."
This is the most terrible kind of publicity...
Don't you think I know it, Grayson?
Smith, send for Mr. Smythe.
- Smythe, send for Mr. Smith.
Double-strength.
"Cinderella Man grows hair on chest."
"'I wear the pants, ' says Anne Schuyler's husband."
Good morning, everybody.
Maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?
Anne, ever get a feeling there was somebody else in the room with you?
- Have you seen this?
- Yeah, the worm.
- Pardon?
- He's a worm, and I'll step on him.
To engage in a brawl, a cheap common brawl in my own home.
"I wear the pants."
Not even the "trousers"!
I tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
- Quit trying to stop anybody.
- Well, at best you might deny it.
Why deny it?
The more you deny, the more they print.
Let them alone.
- Sit still.
Keep your trap shut.
- Trap shut?
Certainly.
I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.
What are you crying about?
Is it true, Stewart?
Did you really say it?
Yes, I said it.
Sure, I said it.
- I didn't say it for publication, though.
- You struck him in our house?
Yes, I'm sorry.
I struck him in your house.
I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
What else do you expect them to call you?
- Dexter.
- That's the 14th crack you've made to me.
I'm keeping count.
When it gets to 20, I'll sock you in the nose.
In fact, I ought to do it now.
Anne, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us?
Haven't you any decency left?
Well, why doesn't Dexter show some decency?
You might show some too, Mother.
What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?
I'm glad you hit that reporter.
He deserved it.
All right.
All right, it's your funeral, Anne Schuyler.
Go on, beat it, shadow.
Cinderella Man.
That's 15.
Pardon me, ma'am.
They've phoned through from the mayor's reception to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
- Are the cars ready?
- They've been ready for half an hour.
I hope I don't have to make any speeches tonight.
You can't disappoint all those women.
It isn't every day they get to see a famous round-the-world flyer.
Yes, I know, but they scare me to death.
This is the fourth dinner that you've taken me to this week.
- I'm running out of material.
- Are you complaining?
Yes, there's always too many other people around.
It's getting late.
What are we waiting for?
You're waiting for my husband.
Excuse me, I'll run up and see what that slowpoke's doing.
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.
Stewart, we're all waiting for you.
- Where's your valet?
- I poisoned him.
Stop trying to be funny and get ready, will you?
- I'm not going.
- What are you talking about?
I'm talking about I'm not going.
- What am I going to tell those people?
- Tell them anything.
Tell them I'm not going.
Tell them I'm not at home.
Would you mind telling me why you're not going?
I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites those sweet-smelling fashion plates.
I don't like them.
They bore me.
They give me the jitters.
You're talking about my friends.
Yes, I'm talking about your friends, and they still give me the jitters.
Well, are you going or aren't you?
- Anne, come here.
- Look out for my lipstick.
I'll tell you what let's do.
Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves.
- Are you crazy?
- Think of the fun we can have.
We'll sneak down the back stairs, get in the valet's Ford.
- Will you stop being silly?
- No, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll introduce you to all my gang.
Would you like that?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
I don't mean the newspaper fellas you don't like.
Another gang I know.
You'd love them.
They're writers and musicians and artists.
Great crowd of people.
Do great things.
People worthwhile.
Meaning that my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
- Oh, no, they're all right.
- That's what you mean.
You've made that clear to me often enough, and I'm sick and tired of it.
- I've given you party after party.
- I didn't...
I've taken you into the best homes introduced you to people of importance.
Are you grateful?
No.
You insult them and act like a beer.
I'm sick and tired of making excuses for you and the things you've done.
It's just as well you're not coming.
Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you and what you're going to do.
And that, my friend, is what is known as:
"Society belle telling ex-star newspaper reporter to go to..."
How have you been, Mr. Smith?
Did you call, sir?
- Smythe?
- Yes.
Smythe.
Come here.
I want to talk to you.
Smythe, come here.
Come on, Smythe, talk to me, will you?
Smythe, I'm going nuts!
I'm going nuts in this house!
This big...
Come here.
Come here.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Look, come on.
Come on, what's the matter with you?
Come here.
- Do you hear something?
- Yes, sir.
- You try it.
- Me, sir?
No, no, no.
Give it more volume.
No, that's enough.
I just wanted to give you an idea.
Now you know.
This house is haunted.
- No, sir.
- Yes.
- Have you looked in the closets?
- Yes, sir.
- Found no skeletons?
- No, sir.
- It's haunted just the same.
- Yes, sir.
Here.
What do you do with yourself when you're not carrying those double-strength?
Well, sir, I putter.
Smythe.
When you're alone and you want to amuse yourself, then what?
I just putter.
Putter.
Do you have to have a putter to putter?
No, sir.
I putter with my hands.
Well, isn't that nice?
You just go right ahead with your...
That's all right.
How do you do that?
Well, sir, I'll show you.
That's puttering, sir.
No.
That's...
Well, well, well.
It's all right if you like it, I guess.
Can anybody...?
Anybody can do that?
Oh, no, sir.
Some people are natural putterers others can never master it.
You mean, some people are born and never would become putterers?
- Yes.
- Oh, my.
Wouldn't that be tragic?
Not to know that you could never be a putterer?
Do you think, if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it... How about me?
- ...someday I might be a putterer?
- You, sir?
You could never be a putterer.
Not a good putterer.
I don't want to putter.
If I can't be a good putterer...
What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
Well, sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease.
A person with a problem could never be a putterer.
For instance, a fish can putter in water but not on land, because he'd be out of place.
An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy.
Now, sir, if you'll pardon me, with all respect as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
- A bird in a gilded cage?
- Yes, sir.
That's all I wanted to know.
Hello.
Hello, Gallagher?
Hello, Gallagher, old pal.
How are you, old pal, huh?
Oh, hello, Stew.
I'm pretty good.
Can't complain.
How's our gentleman of leisure?
I'm on the coast of Norway, and I can't get out.
Will you come get me out of the coast of Norway?
Oh, your play.
Yeah, "Act 1, Scene 1."
Coast of Norway," and then a lot of blanks.
Is that it?
Come on.
Oh, don't be silly.
All right, all right.
If you feel like you need a chaperon call up Hank.
You'll find him at Joe's, no doubt.
Yeah, Hank would be my idea of a perfect bodyguard.
Sure he would.
I knew I could depend on you.
Snap it up, will you, Gallagher?
Okay.
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
Smythe, I'll get this.
I'm expecting some friends.
Very good, sir.
Well, Gallagher!
Come in.
I'm glad to see you.
- Hank, how are you?
- Fine, but kind of thirsty.
Come in.
I'll get you a drink.
- You remember Joe?
- Sure.
I invited him along to bend an elbow with us.
- It's all right.
Bring him in.
- Come on, Joe.
- Hello, Joe.
- Hello, kid.
How are you?
- Glad to see you.
- Just a minute.
Johnson's outside.
Mind if he comes in and dips the beak?
- Bring him in.
The more the merrier.
- Come in.
Come on.
- Hello, Johnson.
- Stew, how are you?
- Glad to see you.
Come in.
- Wait a minute.
I got two of the boys I brought along.
You don't mind...?
You brought two?
All right, bring them in.
- What's the difference?
- Come on in.
Hello, boys.
Come in.
How are you?
Come right in.
- Hello, Stew.
- Well, what the...?
Hello, sonny boy!
I'm sorry nobody could come.
If it isn't Sweetheart.
Why didn't you bring your family with you?
The rest had to get out the morning edition.
They'll be down later.
You sure they're coming?
It'll be lonesome without them.
Smythe, take them in and give them a drink.
And find out what the boys in the backroom want.
I say there, Smythe, don't be holding out on us.
We're willing to help you.
It isn't done, gentlemen!
It isn't done, I say.
It isn't done.
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
I'm sorry, Stew.
I asked Hank and...
Well, Hank did the rest.
Hank brought them?
That's all right.
We'll give them a drink and throw them out.
How's that?
Holy...
Is there a green elephant standing beside him?
- No, this is just little Bingy Baker.
- Bingy...
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends.
Big Chief very sorry.
Show how sorry will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Excuse me, Gallagher.
I wouldn't miss this for the...
Firewater, all right.
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out.
By golly, I'm certainly glad you're not really sore.
You know our racket.
After all, news is news.
Sure, it's all right.
That was a great story.
I wished I'd written it.
Well, I gave her the breaks, didn't I?
That hairy-chest story.
You raised it up to the chin, I see.
Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Smythe!
Smythe, give them one drink, throw them out.
- Yes, sir.
- We're gonna give him one.
You know what I should do?
I should sock you in that funny nose.
- Yes, and I'd love it.
- Sure you'd love it.
How far have you gotten?
Just been able to get off of that Norway coast so far.
"Act 1, Scene 1.
A street in Old Madrid."
You're not getting your play done, but you're covering a lot of territory.
Haven't I covered some territory?
Seems like I've been on a cook's tour.
Stew, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
- Been where?
- Old Madrid?
No.
I've never even been to new Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
I'll draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
- Did who?
- Conrad.
- What do you know about Conrad?
- Not a thing.
Isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Gosh, you look cute.
Isn't he the one who writes only about things he knows?
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Then you write about something you know.
Write about yourself and Anne.
The poor boy who marries a rich girl.
Now, there's a swell theme.
Gee, that's an idea there, Gallagher.
That's an idea there.
I wonder, now.
Oh, sure.
She'd make a beautiful heroine.
And there's her mother.
What a character that old dame would make with her double-strength.
And that lawyer friend of theirs.
He'd make a great villain.
- And there's you.
- What could I be?
I don't know.
You could be something.
Come on, scram.
We got an idea.
Let's get this set.
It's a great idea.
Great idea for a play.
Get me a cigarette, will you?
Let's don't lose this.
Just...
- Here you are.
- All right, thanks.
Now, let's see.
How will I start?
Hey, pal, how would you start?
Smythe, you're a slave.
What's the difference between a king and a butler?
Say, you can't come in here.
This is a private party!
My old classmate from Harvard.
Whoopee!
Harvard, '98.
Hello, Mama!
- And I know who's the cause of it all.
- Oh, Dexter.
Smythe!
Smythe!
- Who are these people?
- Friends of mine.
Very lit...
- Literary people.
- He's drunk.
Smythe, you've been drinking.
- I have.
Double-strength.
- Very drunk.
Where is Mr. Smith?
Well, for crying out loud, I don't know.
And I don't care.
Whoopee!
Now, Gallagher, if I could only get a great scene...
Now, Gallagher, if I could only get a great scene a tremendously emotional scene.
Something to ring the hearts out of the public to bring the curtain down in the second act.
Could you dig one out of your hat?
No.
Afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
We got them up to where the boy's wearing his white Spats and going to pink teas, and the Frau enters.
How's that?
- Very good.
- Now, if we could just get where we...
- Hello, Anne.
- Good morning.
- What does this mean?
- What does what mean?
Oh, that mob.
I got so interested in the play, I forgot all about them.
And we got a play, Anne.
Have we got a play!
Most of it's Gallagher's.
She did most of it.
Her brain just snaps like that all the time.
I'm not interested in the way her brain snaps.
- I think I better go, Stew.
- I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
Wait a minute, Gallagher.
What's the idea, Anne?
The idea is, I want these people to leave immediately.
Wait.
Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Unreasonable?
Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs?
Do you expect me to let this house turn into a cheap barroom?
Don't get excited.
There's no reason for that.
Perhaps the boys have had too much to drink.
I'm sorry.
I'll go down and throw them out.
That's no reason for you to take this attitude.
After all, I have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
Your house?
Oh, I get you.
It's all right.
It's all right.
I don't blame you.
I kind of forgot myself for a moment there.
That's what I call "getting me told," isn't it, Anne?
I suppose I've been boarding out this last year.
I'll tell you this.
I don't like your boarding house, lady.
And if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
Stewart.
It's something I should have done long ago only I didn't have sense enough to do it.
No, I have to stick around and try to make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning.
But no more.
- No more!
So that's that.
- You can't walk out of here like this.
I can't?
Who's gonna stop me?
I'd like to see somebody stop me.
You think I'm gonna stick around this joint just to look at this mausoleum?
Not on your life.
You're gonna make no stuffed shirt out of me.
What do you think of that?
What's going on here?
Who's this woman?
- Joan of Arc.
What's it to you?
- Heavens, the man's insane!
Sure I'm insane!
But I got some good news for you.
This magnolia is leaving your sweet-smelling vanilla joint.
This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on!
And that's what's known as "telling the mother-in-law."
You've done nothing but watch me ever since I've been here.
Treated me like a thug.
Watched me like a hawk.
Mistrusted me.
Every time I leave the house, she counts the silverware.
- That's ridiculous.
- Fine!
Fine, I don't blame her!
I know I'm out of my own crowd.
Should have had better sense.
I'll stay in my own back yard from now on.
- You're acting like a child.
- All right, I'm a child.
All right!
Have it any way you want.
But I'm going back to my own apartment where I should have lived.
But no, I gotta listen to you and move here!
If you wanna live with me, that's okay.
But the sign outside will say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll have to be Mrs. Stew Smith, or there's nothing doing.
No more Anne Schuyler's husband.
Here's some more news for you.
You can take your red room, your green room your left wing and right wing...
You know what to do with them!
- Come on, Gallagher.
- Oh, Stewart!
Pardon me, could you spare a dime for a cup of coffee?
Coffee?
How'd you like to be the knight of the garter?
- No, just coffee.
- It's all right.
Wait just a minute.
Entertain the gentleman, Gallagher.
There you are, my man.
With those, you can eat for a couple months.
How about the socks?
I wouldn't worry too much about it.
She'll see it your way.
I'm not worrying about her.
I'm worrying about that second-act curtain, that's all.
You're just a first-class chump.
You just staged a scene that plays like a million.
That declaration of independence for the second-act curtain?
It's an idea, Gallagher.
It's a great idea.
Hey, Gallagher.
- Yeah?
- How about my breakfast?
How do I bring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
- It'll be ready soon.
- Never mind.
If you can't get my breakfast ready and get here on time...
- ...then get yourself another job.
- Sorry, boss.
Don't be sorry, just get the breakfast, that's all.
Hello, Smith.
- Holy jumping swordfish!
- I suppose you know why I came?
I've no idea, unless some of the silverware's missing.
No.
Don't be absurd, Smith.
May I come in?
- Surely.
Come right in.
- Thanks.
May I sit down?
Sure.
If I'd known you were coming, I'd have thrown you up a waffle.
- I don't eat waffles.
- You don't?
Anne asked me to come see you about the divorce.
- She did?
- She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Listen, Grayson, I've got $106.75 in the bank.
Anne can have that.
But she's gotta hurry, I'm spending it awful fast.
You don't understand.
Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
We would like to know how much you would want to...
Wait a minute!
Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
That's putting it crudely but...
- Remember about that 20th crack?
- Perfectly.
You've just made it.
Before you go unconscious...
- ...get this through your nut.
- Pardon?
"Unconscious." When you don't know anything.
Your natural state.
There are some people you can't buy their self-respect.
- I'm one of those guys.
- We just thought...
Don't think.
I'll do the thinking.
Go back there and tell them I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now.
I was too poor to buy her a wedding present, so a divorce is her present.
Now, stand up!
And now for that 20th crack.
Who was that?
Schuyler's lawyer.
What did he want?
He just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
What was the idea he gave you?
Swell idea, Gallagher.
How's this?
The lawyer comes to see the kid to talk over the divorce, you know.
They insult the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony.
The kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out.
How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
Well, from now on, the play will be easy.
All you have to do is bring the wife back.
Have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
What's the matter?
You think I'll let him go back to his wife?
Not on your life.
He's got to go to the other girl.
What other girl?
Little O'Brien girl, of course.
The one you suggested in the story.
But that's ridiculous, Stew.
You can't make a sudden change like that.
What you gonna do, tell me how to write a play?
There's nothing sudden about that.
He's always loved the girl.
But he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her.
That's all right.
We can fix that.
He'll go to her and...
Here, I'll show you.
He'll go to the little O'Brien gal, and he'll say...
In some pretty words of some kind, he'll say...
Something that you can write.
He'll say, "Darling, I'm sorry.
I've been a fool all my life."
I've always loved you.
I didn't have sense enough to see it.
And as quick as I get a divorce from my wife, I want you to marry me."
She'll look at him and then she'll say, "Yeah."
And then they'll embrace, or something like that.
Then he'll kiss her or something.
What's the matter, Gallagher?
What's the matter?
Liberty is the happy man's due
But then there are some
Who no worse crimes have done
It's the sad story we tell
From a prison cell
What's your problem?
Shut up!
Another day in hard labor spent
Like all the other yesterdays went
With just one horizon in sight
Iron bars morning till night
Ah, pity those who dwell
In a prison cell
My old friend, life is great
When you're free to be yourself
So come on, let's emancipate
Fresh air is good for the health
Everywhere, if you take a chance,
Everywhere, life is a melody
Everywhere, it's wine and romance
So here's to us two and liberty!
Run for it, Louis!
Forget about me!
Thanks, Emile!
Look there we can see It's he, it's really he.
Let us follow rapidly This way, it's he
The finish line's in sight Pedal with all your might
We're almost home, all right The finish line's now in sight
Here he comes, yes it's he
He's the victor, the celebrity!
Do they fit?
Like a glove. Excuse me, sir.
How much?
I'll let you have it... for 8 francs.
Much too much.
7 francs 50.
7 francs.
Only because it's you. 10 francs.
7, 8, 9 and 10, thank you.
Good day, sir.
Say, mister...
Got any hankies? New ones.
I'll go check.
Help!
Help!
- I can't breathe! - What happened?
Which way did he go?
Thataway.
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief!
- What happened?
- I've been robbed.
Which way'd they go?
Thataway.
You dropped your wallet.
Thank you, it's really kind of you!
Looking for a phonograph? Our latest model's inside. It doesn't cost anything to look.
PALACE OF RECORDS
Not at work?
Don't you know that...
Work is mandatory.
Because work means liberty.
Work is mandatory
Because work means liberty.
Let me out!
There are moments when we ponder
The love we have yet to know
The lover who is yet to show
Though silently we hope him yonder
Will I meet this lover some day?
At what time, in what way?
Come, my lover to be
I've loved you since an early date
I've loved you, though your name is a mystery
It's you I call, it's you I await
Love thrives on hope And a touch of folly
All it takes is one look for joy to start
Come and erase my melancholy
Come and enchant my heart
Come, let me love you and you will love me
Let me read deep in your eyes
Those lines of timeless poetry...
My uncle's coming.
When can I see you?
Can't you watch out?
Put your potatoes elsewhere.
Who asked you?
You don't know who I am.
That will do. That will do!
Excuse me, sir...
Out of my sight!
I forbid you to address my niece.
...walk in formation.
We will give you a job of worth
You who seek an occupation
State your name and date of birth
Leave fingerprint identification
About-face in formation
We will give you a job of worth
Where are you going?
I want to leave.
So why'd you come?
Don't know what you want, do you?
Get in line with the others.
Don't move!
- You're still here?
- Let go. Get going, since you want to leave!
Halt!
Forward, march!
One, two!
It's not my fault, pal.
- Let me... - I'll get chewed out.
Hold on, you'll see.
Jeanne!
Leave me alone.
Come now, child, you have to be nice to me.
Look, miss, they've gone crazy!
What's wrong?
You're crying.
What's going on?
I don't know.
You don't know.
Did you see anything?
I don't get it. They all jumped on me.
What d'you have to say?
I couldn't place my part...
So I ran after the belt... What's your version?
He got in my way. I couldn't work. What about you?
The three of 'em rushed me.
The three of them?
So you're one of them?
It was those two.
They mixed me up.
- So it's you?
- Me?
Not at all. He started it.
He started it all.
Where'd he go?
- I don't know. - You don't know?
Go on!
- Hello, old man. - Hello, my good man.
Can I help you?
Don't you recognize me?
Not at all.
This must be some joke.
Who is this?
Don't remember Emile?
I get it.
You don't want them finding out. - Enough!
Move along!
There's no time to lose.
Just a minute.
This fellow must have something to tell me.
This is quite amusing. Come with me.
I'm in a hurry. I've got to go.
There's one more thing we need to know.
Just a minute, gentlemen.
Isn't this something!
Unheard-of!
What are you doing standing here?
Run along. Run along, you two.
And you? Will you run along!
Get a move on!
How's this open?
What for?
- To return a hankie. - Want to start a scandal?
- That's not it!
- Listen, Emile!
Stay here.
If you don't stop by the count of 3, I'll blow your brains out.
1... 2...
Will you stop?
3. Come on.
You hurt yourself. What did you expect?
Keep quiet! Take it.
Not enough?
You want more.
What are you waiting for?
Let this be the last of you.
So here's to us two and liberty!
A good likeness.
What a fool!
Not so loud.
What a fool!
What do you think?
Our friend looks splendid.
Simply splendid!
Doesn't he?
How does Louis look to you?
Magnificent!
Do you mean it? This is an outrage.
While her husband works!
They're not married.
- Not married?
- She's a floozy.
And he's a parvenu.
They're watching us.
I'm so sorry, Louis isn't home yet.
But, dear Madam, we can wait.
It's late.
You must forgive him. He works so hard.
Everywhere, life is a melody
Everywhere, it's wine and romance
So here's to us two and liberty!
Not eating?
- I am. - How's that?
You sit there staring into space.
Like a wound is my desire
My sorrow knows no bounds
I am so sad I shall expire
You clumsy oaf!
Hold this!
You, too?
I didn't get any cake. I didn't have any cake.
Nothing at all. I'm so sorry, believe me.
Good help is hard to find.
It won't stain. It's only sugar and milk.
Don't go.
That's enough. It stopped raining.
Go on.
I'm so sorry for what happened.
I'm fed up, fed up!
Listen, darling...
It's all set then. See you tomorrow.
Say, my suit looks good on you.
As if it were made for you. Almost.
But it doesn't beat that!
Hey, you!
Who d'you think you are?
Just you wait!
If I wanted to catch you...
Your behavior tonight...
Spare me!
What d'you want, money?
Boor!
Just take it and get off my back!
Did you see that?
So you don't like it?
Wait and see.
My turn!
Watch this.
You win!
Everywhere, if you take a chance,
Everywhere, life is a melody
Everywhere, it's wine and romance
So here's to us two and liberty!
What are you doing here?
Joseph!
How are things?
Just fine.
Don't you recognize a friend? Coming out of there?
A friend's house.
A friend? Shall I awaken the master?
No need to.
See you soon, I hope...
Sure, but I gotta run.
Where's the fire?
Is that the mistress...
leaving?
Yes, sir.
You don't say!
What are you standing there for?
Get inside!
Is this yours?
We inaugurate our new plant tomorrow.
In the first month, it will turn out daily 2000 models like this one.
In the second month, 3000... What is it?
What do you want?
All right.
Gentlemen...
We'll continue this later.
He's overstepped all bounds!
Just who is that man?
This can't go on!
What did I tell you?
Will you get off my back?
Know who they are?
Now get out and stay away from the plant.
What do you want? Money?
What then?
It's like this...
I want to stay at the plant.
You can't. It's the one place I can't have you.
Why do you want to stay?
I'm in love. Who with?
A girl who works at the plant.
Step up, my friend. Sir...
Where's he going?
- I'm right here, sir. - Not you, him! Step up.
You, too.
Is this your niece? Yes, sir.
This gentleman wishes to marry her.
This gentleman is my friend.
Do you understand?
Perfectly, sir.
The director wants you.
Director?
The big director.
Don't worry about money.
Here's her dowry.
Thank you, sir.
Excuse me.
May I?
What is it you want?
Listen. I just wanted to tell you...
Nothing.
Would you like to get married?
Of course she would, sir.
A friend of mine would like to marry you. Oh, no, sir.
Only the other day, you said so.
I never said...
Please excuse her, sir. She's feeling a bit intimidated.
- It'll work out. - I count on you.
You needn't worry.
My friend's charming.
I know him.
I'm sure you'll change your mind, miss.
I doubt it, sir.
Come along.
It'll work out. I can't understand you.
The chance of a lifetime!
Come along, my dear.
Have no fear, she'll agree to everything.
- Relax. It'll all work out. - Thanks.
I've seen the girl.
I'll tell you later. Isn't that so?
Of course, sir.
My niece can't wait to meet you.
I'm so glad.
If you'd care to come tonight...
Do you mind, sir?
Come tonight...
That was him!
Yes, your fiance.
Having dinner here?
No, I have my date.
And I've got guests.
See you tomorrow.
Tomorrow's the great day. I inaugurate my new plant.
And I celebrate my engagement, I hope.
So everything's fine?
Firmin!
Joseph!
Where is everyone?
Dear friends!
What's going on here?
You thought of everything!
Going already?
Let's do some serious talking.
That's what we came for.
Will that do? It'll do.
Don't bother!
If we blab, you lose everything.
Your status. Your fortune.
That's what you're gonna share with us.
So that's it!
Is that all?
What brings you gentlemen here?
How's that?
We received a report on a housebreaking.
Housebreaking!
But it's a practical joke played by my friends.
You came for nothing.
Please forgive them.
But I was tied hand and foot!
I was doing my duty.
As you always do.
- What are you doing here? - Papers!
Is this a joke?
We're done for.
He took us for a ride.
We can't get out.
Trapped like rats!
We can't stay here! Isn't there a combination? Things look bad.
- What is it?
- They'll blow the whistle on me.
So what?
We have to get ready to run.
- What was that?
- The police are after me.
You idiot! Shut the door, quick!
May I help you?
It's nothing, sir, but a man's slipped into the plant.
A man? We're looking for him.
I haven't seen a soul.
But be my guest, have a good look.
You took the case?
The case I put here.
I just saw a guy with it!
What are you doing here?
We're friends of the director.
Sure!
We came with him tonight.
That's right.
Isn't that right?
- He's a pal. - Aren't you?
Is that all you have to say?
If you don't speak up, they'll arrest us.
But you'll be joining us soon.
Be seeing you, then.
Goodbye.
Here, Inspector, look at this. We'll look at it later.
Take 'em away!
Let's move it!
In our new plant, men will have no other task other than supervising the machines.
The machines will do all the work.
They will manufacture our phonographs.
"Organization and progress," that is our motto.
This explains the success of our earlier factories.
It will be the same under our new enterprise, which will now start up before your very eyes.
Won't you cut the garland?
Won't you cut this garland?
Cut it?
Step over here.
All hail Progress, child of Science
Which extends its hand to the future
The golden torch of hope...
It's very simple:
We introduce the materials there.
We stand back and then...
There you have it!
It guides its sister, Human Intelligence,
Towards the sunlight...
My congratulations!
It's marvelous!
Ladies and gentlemen...
On this solemn occasion, when the Machine has proven that if it can replace the hand of man, it cannot replace his brain, allow me first to pay homage to the brilliant creator behind the destiny of this magnificent factory.
This man who, despite humble beginnings, forged a place for himself, and earned the respect of his contemporaries, whose name is forever linked with phonograph history, this philanthropist, this great citizen...
This scoundrel!
This riffraff!
It's him, all right.
- You recognize him?
- You bet I do.
I arrested him.
If you want to arrest him again, you'd better hurry.
He's been tipped off. He'll make a run for it.
All right. Get down there.
This historic moment, when the fiery gaze of the future looks back on the dazzling flame of the present.
I haven't said everything.
Gentlemen, the opening of this factory is my crowning achievement.
I have nothing more to do among you. I am leaving you.
I hereby make a gift of my factories to all whose who have worked with me.
The machines will now work for them.
Destiny beckons me to other paths.
As a great poet once wrote:
"Let us raise our souls and our hearts
"As the mother raises her child."
These words come to mind on this day when I wish...
We can lift our heads high and declare that the future destiny of mankind seems to bear great promise.
We will soon taste the fruit...
When all things around us operate
Friends, let us enjoy our idleness
Beneath sunny skies what a sweet fate
To laze about and sing like this
Let's indulge in this infinite elation
It takes one kiss for it to start
My whole being finds exhiliration
In the gentle beating of your heart
You must never think of marrying
When you were born to live on the road
While awaiting the wisdom age may bring
Think of love as a mere episode
That's our fate
Old mate
My old friend, the Earth is round
There are women wherever you go
When we finally run out of ground
That's the time to take it slow
Everywhere, if you take a chance
Everywhere, life is a melody
Everywhere, it's wine and romance
So here's to us two and liberty!
Driver.
- Driver, stop! - What troubles you in there? Why do you want to stop?
The man up there, he is bleeding to death. Can't stop.
Not here. Brakes won't hold.
Orderly. Orderly!
And just as guilty as a soldier would be, who deserted his post under fire.
Now, in making an example of you, I...
I beg your pardon, sir. I have some wounded outside.
I am looking for the... Oh, yes, yes, yes. You want the Italian unit.
We're the English here, you see. Yes, Number 207. They're in the other wing.
Moved in today. Yes, out that way, straight ahead.
- Thank you, Major. - Hmm.
What's the girlfriend been doing?
Typical male conceit!
I think they're going to send her back home.
That's a dirty shame. - She'll be disgraced.
- It's regulations. At least they might let her have her baby here.
If they send her back now, all her friends will know.
- And her family. - She's only herself to blame.
This is war, Fergy, and she loved him.
Shh, here they come.
Well, is it necessary for us all to be here at one time?
Get back to your posts. You will be packed and ready to leave within the hour.
Molly?
Can I help you pack?
I guess so. If you want to. Why, of course I want to.
- Good girl.
- I beg your pardon? I say, she's the only human being in the whole lot of us.
I'm sorry Miss Barkley appears to sympathise with one who has disgraced the uniform we all wear.
- Baby!
- Rinaldi! - Frederico! - Get away.
You're filthy. You Anglo-Saxons!
You're not too clean yourself.
Did you bring me some good cases, baby?
Did you have trouble finding us? - No.
- How do you feel?
- Is there going to be an offensive? - There's not... Were you under fire?
Madonna, but I worried about you!
Yes, I can see how much you've been worrying. Seven operations today, baby.
And one of them was beautiful. I took the heart out.
It lay in my hand and it beat like this.
You should have seen it.
It was lovely! Soon, Rinaldi will be the best surgeon in all the corps.
Then, in all the army.
And some day, in all of Italy. - Why not in all the world?
- Why not?
You will like it here, baby.
What sort of a town is this? Any girls? Many beautiful English nurses.
- No, I mean, girls.
- Girls, too, a house full of them. Another Villa Rossa? Some of them have never been to the front before.
Perhaps.
But the nurses are much nicer. The most beautiful is Miss Barkley. I am in love with her.
- Does she know it?
- Not yet.
- Have you any money? - Yes. - Lend me 50 lire.
- What for? I want to make on Miss Barkley the impression of a man of sufficient wealth.
- All right. - Thank you.
You are my great and good friend and financial protector.
And you're an ass. And now we will eat and drink, and I will take you to meet Miss Barkley.
But you must make for me a good impression upon her.
Now, listen... But you must.
And you can have a nurse, too. There is another one named Miss Ferguson.
She is also very, very nice. - No. - "No"?
First, we will eat and drink, and then we'll go and see the girls who have never been to the front before.
Yes? Yes.
You know what an American is?
- Yes. - What is it?
She doesn't know.
- Well, I'm an American. - Then what are you doing here?
- Drinking, mostly.
- He liked the uniform. Wrong.
I liked their language.
Then what were you doing in Italy?
Studying.
Studying what?
Architecture.
You know what that is?
- Yes. - What?
You see, she doesn't know.
- Neither do I. - Oh, you've had too much wine.
It's filthy wine.
It takes the enamel off your teeth and leaves it on the roof of your mouth.
- Where was I? - Architecture. Oh, yes.
Look... I'll explain.
This, my dear, is called an arch.
The arch, my dear, is perhaps the oldest of architectural devices.
Arch. Architecture.
The very word will tell you how inextricably the two are one.
In a word, my dear, architecture is the most ancient of the arts.
Just as yours is the most ancient of the professions.
You'd better put your shoe on, or you'll get cold feet.
If you please, I'd like to go now.
The air raid seems to be over.
Catherine!
Catherine! - Catherine! - Here I am, Fergy.
- Oh, I worried. Oh! - Oh.
Nobody saw where you went.
Who's that man? Oh, I don't know. Some lunatic.
What if we take the mountains to the north?
Behind them are more mountains, and behind those, more yet.
And we take them all only if the Austrians stop fighting. One side must stop.
- Stop? It will go on forever. - Like him.
The Priest wants the Austrians to win the war. - No, no, no. It is not true.
- But you don't want us to attack. If we must have war, I suppose we have to attack.
Oh, but so many die that way. But what is death to a Christian.
Don't encourage him, Fergy. Frederico.
- Oh, you are back safe. - Hello, Father. - I am so glad.
- The Priest prayed for you, Frederico. - Every time you go out he does the same.
You nearly missed the party. But it is very dull. But Miss Barkley is here, and her friend Miss Ferguson.
The one you will like. Come.
Miss Barkley, permit me to present to you my friend and war brother, Lieutenant Henry.
He has just returned back from the front.
How do you do?
And this is Miss Ferguson.
- How do you do? - How do you do?
Now he begins again, that fellow. Quick, let us go into the garden.
Now, you stay here. I will find something for us to drink.
Asti? Grappa? Vermouth?
- Which do you like? - All of them.
Then you shall have all of them.
- Nice out here. - Hmm, isn't it?
We seem fated to bump into each other in the dark.
I'm sorry about that. I mistook you for someone else.
So I gathered.
- I had been drinking. - I gathered that, too.
- Mad?
- No. - You're an American, aren't you?
- Yes. Well, then what are you doing in the Italian army?
It's not really the army, it's only the ambulance.
It's very odd, though.
Why did you do it? I don't know.
Why did you? Oh, I joined up in England.
- Where is Miss Ferguson?
- Why don't you go see?
Yes, do bring her out, Captain Rinaldi.
- Have some? - Thanks. He's sore.
What for?
Because I'm here with you. Women prefer him, as a rule.
Shall we take a walk?
Yes, let's.
Where is he now?
- Who? - The boy you're engaged to. - He's dead.
He was killed in the Somme. Were you engaged long? Eight years.
We grew up together.
Why didn't you marry?
I didn't know what the war was like then.
If I had it to do over again, I'd marry him, or anything.
When I joined up, I remember having this silly idea that he might come to the hospital where I was, with a sabre cut, I suppose, and a bandage around his head.
Something picturesque. This is a picturesque front.
Not France. He didn't have a sabre cut.
They blew him to bits.
What are you thinking about now?
About whisky. What about whisky?
About how nice it is. And you're nice, too.
No. - Why not? - No, don't.
- Yes. - No, please!
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
It's all right. I'm dreadfully sorry.
Really. I... I just couldn't bear the nurses'-evening-off aspect of it.
It's quite all right. I don't mind at all.
Poor man. You see, I've been leading a funny sort of life.
Besides, you're so very beautiful.
You don't have to talk a lot of nonsense, I said I'm sorry.
We could get along.
Couldn't we?
You're sweet. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you're a dear.
I'd be very glad to have you kiss me now, if you don't mind.
You are looking for someone?
- Have you seen Miss Barkley?
- Miss Barkley?
- Didn't she go out there with you?
- With me?
- No, no, no. - But just a little while ago...
I thought I saw her go out to the garden gate with the Lieutenant Henry.
She went out with an officer?
Alone? Well, perhaps I was mistaken, you know, it is quite dark out there.
Oh, she wouldn't do that.
No. No, I am sure I was mistaken.
Where is she, then?
You're a grand girl.
I'm a crazy girl.
- Why? - To stay out here.
It's nice. Isn't that enough?
Hmm, it's nice. I suppose that has to be enough for people who are living as we live.
Back home, I'd have courted you and sent you flowers.
Out here, you crowd it all into one hour.
Isn't that the way it's got to be, out here?
Look... Tomorrow morning I've got to go up to the front again.
And if a shell got me and you never saw me again, then we'd both be sorry that we've been so formal and waited.
Besides, what's there so fine in putting it off, dragging it out,
- giving me your lips tonight...
- No... - ...your throat tomorrow... - No.
No, please... No...
Catherine?
Thanks for the lovely concert. - I...
- I hope you are not worried about Miss Barkley.
It's not like her to disappear this way.
Well, perhaps she felt ill and went home alone.
Perhaps. Good night. Come, girls, come.
Why didn't you tell me?
It doesn't matter. If it had to happen, I'd rather it were like this.
I couldn't know. In a church or out under the stars.
- Well, why not?
- "Why not"?
There's a war on.
And tonight, who cares, and tomorrow, who knows.
What did you say your name was?
Stop it. If you...
If you knew how I was back home, you'd see the funny side of it.
Please, stop it.
Oh! We blame everything on the war, but that's rot.
It's something in ourselves.
The lady sat in the public square and mourned her lost innocence.
Don't be sorry. I'm not.
I love you.
Oh, darling.
Did you have a nice, uh, time, baby?
You made progress with her, eh?
We're friends. If that's what you mean.
I mean, uh... Was she nice to you, practically speaking?
- Shut up!
- I am a man of extreme delicacy, - but was she...
- Rinaldi!
Will you please shut up?
If you wanna be a friend of mine, shut up.
I am your best friend and your war brother. Then shut up.
Miss Barkley prefers you to me. That is very clear.
But Miss Ferguson is very nice, too.
You like her? No.
That you of all people...
A lot of geese, that's what you are!
Silly geese! Stuffed with bunk about woman's part in the war.
We must bring solace to the men who fight, sacrifice ourselves, give ourselves.
If you'd known him for a long time, or been in love with him...
But you only met him tonight.
How long must you know a man before you can love him?
Are you pretending to be in love with that man?
I think I am, Fergy. I must be.
You're just another conquest to him.
One in a hundred. You'll probably never see him again.
He said if he'd met me back home, he'd have courted me, sent me flowers...
I suppose I won't ever see him again.
Ciao, baby. Good luck.
- Turn back. - Back?
Yes, back!
- I wanna see Miss Barkley. - She's on duty.
Wait, you can't go in there.
Hey, why have you come back in here for?
The Tenente, he knows what he's doing.
Please.
What's wrong, Bonello?
Going to ever get started here? We got plenty of time. Oh, the...
I thought you started. What are you doing here?
We come back, Signor Capitano.
Tenente forgot something. Oh.
Hi. You're all right, aren't you?
Yes, I'm all right.
I came to... I thought...
You see... I...
I'm going to be away for a while, and I didn't want you to think that I'd just gone away.
No, I...
What I mean is, I'd hate to have you feel that...
That it wasn't important to me. About... About us.
Uh, I don't exactly know how to say it.
You've said it very nicely, dear, thank you.
No, I don't mean...
- You mustn't feel...
- Will you be gone long?
No. Only a few days. There's gonna be a show above...
Nothing much, I guess. A show? You'll be careful, won't you?
I won't get hit. Hold this.
Here. It's a Saint Anthony.
They say a Saint Anthony is very useful to guard you from harm.
I'll take good care of him.
I wish I could kiss you.
He is my friend and a good soldier.
I do not like to see him lose his head over a woman.
Aren't you exaggerating a bit?
I think not. Couldn't we send her back to the base, Major?
Oh, if you could send her away, it would simplify everything.
Could perhaps send her to Milan. Excellent, my dear Major!
Magnificent! No wonder the English are first in diplomacy.
Er, what did you say her name was?
We won't get anything else to eat once the attack starts.
This is all they've given me.
Starting to eat, Tenente?
No, we'll all eat together. Come on, sit down to it.
- Thank you. - Here, you cut this.
Wash it down with wine, Tenente.
Who goes to the attack?
Bersaglieri.
If nobody would attack, the war would be over.
That was a big one.
- Four hundred twenty? - No, 305.
- Sounded like a Skoda to me.
- Skoda, that's what I say.
Are you badly hit, Tenente?
Anybody hurt?
My leg. Hold my neck, Tenente.
You were right, Tenente.
Lacerations of the scalp and possible fracture of the skull.
Multiple superficial wounds of the left and right thigh, left and right knee, and right foot.
Profound wounds of right knee and foot incurred in line of duty.
- Come on, lift him up a little more. - All right. Carefully!
Hurry, hurry!
How do you feel, baby?
Rinaldi. What are you doing here?
Bonello telephoned me.
The Major gave me permission to come.
No one shall hurt you, baby.
I won't let them. No butcher is going to touch my war brother.
Only Rinaldi can take you and never hurt you.
You must forgive me, baby, for talking so much, but I am...
I'm very moved to see you badly wounded.
How did it happen? I will see you are decorated for bravery.
Perhaps we can get you the medaglia d'argento, but surely the bronze one.
Did you carry somebody on your back?
I didn't carry anybody.
I couldn't move.
Surely there was something heroic. Tell me what you did.
I was blown up eating cheese.
Don't worry, baby. I will fix you so that you are as good as new. You will see.
Every day, I learn to do things smoother, quicker.
Soon, very soon, you will be walking again.
I brought a present for you.
You will find it under your blanket, next to your heart. It is a bottle of brandy, baby.
Very good brandy. The infantry captured it from the Austrians on San Gabriele.
I have another surprise for you.
Take a deep breath.
Where do you think you will go from here?
To the Italian hospital where they have the male nurses with the beards? No.
I will arrange everything with my friend, the British Major.
You will go to Milan. To the beautiful Miss Barkley.
That makes you happy, huh?
Think of Rinaldi, left all alone with the war. No one to make fun of.
While you are in Milan with the beautiful Miss Barkley.
Making love in Milan to the chaste Miss Barkley.
Look out for the step.
Why do you stop?
I am the superintendent.
May I have your medical papers, please?
They're in my coat. In the buttoned-down pocket.
Take him up those stairs, down the corridor.
His room is the one at the end.
You show them, Giulio. Who are you?
I am the porter, Signor Tenente. Come, follow me.
Now, Signor Tenente, we must lift you off the bed.
- All right. But keep my legs straight. - Si, Signor Tenente.
Anything more, Signor Tenente?
- Get me some brandy. - No, it's not allowed, Signor Tenente.
Wasn't I wounded, fighting for the glory of Italy?
- You'll find some money in my pocket. - As you wish.
- So it's you.
- Ferguson. - Is Catherine here?
- As if you didn't know.
I believe that's why you got wounded. - Where is she? - You ought to be still.
Here's your chart.
I must take your temperature. Does she know I'm here?
Under the arm, please.
- Hello, darling. - Catherine.
You're lovely.
- Are you badly hurt?
- You're lovely. Oh, my poor darling. It's your leg, isn't it?
- You're the loveliest thing I ever saw. - Oh...
I have to go now, darling, I can't stay.
- You'll come back? - Later.
- But we have to be awfully careful. - You've got to come back.
I will, when I can. - Tonight? - I'll try.
Somebody's coming. Tonight.
I'll take that thermometer now.
Good gracious! Fetch the doctor.
It's a miracle you're not delirious with such a fever.
- I haven't got any fever.
- Stay quiet, please. It's not what you think.
I have brought you a few little things.
And this is mosquito netting, and this is a bottle of vermouth. You like vermouth, huh?
- And these are English papers.
- Thank you, Father. It's very good of you to come.
Oh, but I mustn't stay long. They warned me not to tire you.
You seem very tired yourself.
I am tired, but I have no right to be.
- You have the war disgust.
- No. But I hate the war.
- I don't enjoy it. - But you do not mind it. You do not see it.
Oh, you must forgive me. I know you are wounded.
That was an accident. Still, even wounded, you do not see it. I can tell.
I do not see it myself, but I feel it a little.
Come in, Cat.
Don't go yet, Father.
It's still early. You are sure? With the operation in the morning, he should rest.
Oh, he's strong.
He has such a lovely temperature. It is always normal. I'm very proud of his temperature.
Maybe all our children will have fine temperatures, too.
Our children will probably have beastly temperatures.
Don't mind us, Father. We're in love.
I know. I could see it in your faces.
You approve, don't you, Father?
You spoke of children.
This, too, is the war. Without the war, you would have married in God's grace.
Is it not so?
And you?
I hadn't thought about it like that, but... Yes, I suppose so.
Father, are you...
Of course you realise, Father, that army regulations prevent us from marrying?
They'd send Catherine home.
Poor Cat. Such a crazy marriage.
At least I'm in white.
No orange blossoms.
I can smell them.
No organ music.
I can hear it plainly.
It was a foolish notion, perhaps.
I have not the right to say you are married. Yet, it has made me happy to do this.
For now, from my heart, I can say I bless you in His name.
Goodbye and be happy, both of you.
Thank you, Father.
- Give my regards to the mess.
- I will. And get well soon.
I will come again the next time I am in Milan. - Goodbye, my dear. - Goodbye.
Is Miss Barkley here?
Uh-uh.
Shut the door.
- I can't. - Please, darling.
We mustn't.
Your operation's in the morning. It's our wedding night. Oh, darling.
You'll have to take your oil.
Castor oil? No. You'll take it from me.
- Darling. ...if you stay.
Oh, darling, darling.
I want what you want. There isn't any "me" any more, just what you want.
Don't I make a lovely wife? Such a lovely wife.
Feel our hearts beat.
No wonder my heart beats. I'm mad about you.
That's the opera I made my debut in at La Scala.
- They threw benches at him.
- That's a lie! Yes, they did. I threw six benches myself.
That's not funny.
Oh, now he is offended. He'll get over it.
That's his sore spot.
We always tease him.
You don't care whom you hurt. Now, don't you get mad, too.
Catherine and I were thinking of asking you to our wedding.
Weren't we, Cat?
- You'll never get married. - We will! No, you won't.
You'll fight before you marry.
- Oh, we never fight. - You've time yet.
We won't fight ever. You'll die, then.
Fight or die. That's what people do.
- They don't marry. - Why, Fergy!
I'm not crying.
Maybe you'll be all right, you two.
Watch out you don't get her in trouble.
- I won't get her into trouble.
- You better not. Or I'll kill you.
Why, Fergy...
What is the matter with her?
She doesn't like me, that's all.
Oh, no. She just likes me more.
Are you on night duty tonight?
Yes, but you won't care. You'll go right off to sleep.
You wait and see.
Darling, how many other girls have you ever loved?
None. How many, really?
None.
How many have you, um...
How do you say it... Loved?
- None. - You're lying to me.
- Of course. - Oh, that's right. You just keep right on lying, that's what I want you to do.
Were they pretty?
I have never been with anyone.
That's right, darling.
What were they like?
I don't know anything about it. You're just mine.
That's true. You've never belonged to anyone else.
I don't care if you have, though.
I'm not afraid of them. Only, don't tell me about them.
You never told them you loved them, did you?
- No. - I knew you wouldn't.
- Oh, darling, I do love you.
- Then, kiss me. - Right here on the street? - Yes.
I'll go in first.
So...
What is this, if I may ask? What was in it?
That's kummel.
That's the best kind. It comes in those bear-shaped bottles from Russia.
And these?
That's brandy, wine and whisky.
And I've been pitying you for being wounded.
Pity is something that is wasted on you.
- Thank you. - If you're so anxious not to go back to the front,
I should think you'd try something more intelligent.
Not self-inflicted alcoholism!
- What? - I said, "Alcoholism!"
And I also say that I'll see your convalescent leave is cancelled.
You'll go back to the front tomorrow night.
Have I time for a drink before the train leaves? - For the front?
- Yes. - About 20 minutes, Signor Capitano. - Right.
It's a fine room, a lovely room.
It's all right. The red plush is just the thing.
Those mirrors are very attractive, too.
People who go in for vice seem to have very good taste about it.
Hmm, you're a grand girl. Oh, darling.
I wish we could do something really simple.
Everything we do seems so innocent and right.
You're a fine, simple girl.
I am a simple girl. Nobody but you ever realised it.
At first, I thought you were a crazy girl.
I was a little crazy at first.
Was that your train?
Maybe.
It makes up at Turin. But it stays in the station here until time to leave.
There's really lots of time.
"But at my back, I always hear Time's winged chariot hurrying near"
I know that poem.
It's by Marvell. Oh, it's about a girl who wouldn't live with a man.
Listen.
It's only the rain.
I hate the rain.
I like it. I'm afraid of the rain.
- Afraid, why?
- I... - Well, perhaps it's silly.
- What? Tell me. - No.
- Tell me. All right.
I'm afraid of the rain because sometimes I see me dead in it.
No! And sometimes I see you dead in it.
- That's more likely.
- Oh, now, darling, don't say that.
That is your train.
Time's winged chariot.
I'll come with you, hmm?
No, please, I don't want you...
Not... Not at the station.
All right, darling. How often will you write?
As often as I can. Do they read your letters?
They can't read English enough to hurt anything.
Well, I'll make them very confusing.
But not too confusing. Oh, I should have got you a going-away gift.
A whistle to make you feel better in the dark.
Or a sword. I'm sure we could get a used sword very cheap.
Swords aren't very useful at the front.
Oh, I see, they get in the way of your legs when you're running.
They might be useful at mess, though.
I'm afraid I have to start, darling.
I hate to leave our fine house.
So do I.
We never stay settled very long in a home, do we?
We will.
I'll have a fine home for you when you come back.
Say, "I'll come back to Catherine."
I'll come back to Catherine.
I'll always come back.
Maybe this time, you'll be hurt just a little in the foot.
- Or the lobe of the ear. - Oh, no, no, no. I want your ears just the way they are.
Your feet have been hurt already.
I want a ticket to Switzerland, please.
- To where, signora, to what town?
- The nearest one to Italy. That would be Brissago, signora.
- Then give me a ticket to Brissago. - All right. Oh...
Oh, Fergy, I was afraid you wouldn't come. Would you mind telling me what this is all about?
- So I gathered by this, but where? - I'm going away.
Why?
To Switzerland, to have a baby.
Oh.
I knew he'd get you in trouble.
Oh, now, it wasn't his fault, really, Fergy. What's he going to do about it?
He doesn't know it.
You didn't tell him? What would be the good? It would only worry him.
He'd have to go anyway. Aren't you going to tell him?
Well, not yet. I may write him from Switzerland.
- You're a fool. - Here, signora.
- On Track 3. - Thank you.
What's the hurry? Why tonight? I couldn't go back to that hospital.
I couldn't stand it. Not with him gone. But you'll be all alone in Switzerland.
Don't worry, Fergy, I'll be all right.
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
Only of going back to that hospital.
Don't scold me, Fergy.
I'll carry it.
"I've always told you I was a crazy girl.
"I couldn't bear Milan with you away.
"So I've chucked the war and come to live in this little Swiss town
"as near as possible to the Italian border and you.
"And, darling, it's an adorable place and we'll be very happy here. "I've taken a suite...
"...suite in the best hotel.
"And I'm fairly wallowing in luxury. "The bed is Empire and fit for an empress.
"There's a maroon velvet carpet, ankle-deep, "and a bathroom... Oh, darling, the bathroom!
"It's of black marble with silver fittings.
"I've just dined in state at my sitting-room window,
"from which there is a divine view of the lake shimmering in moonlight."
I'm an awful liar, darling.
It's not really a nice place at all.
It's mean, cheap and horrible.
But it doesn't matter where I live, because I don't really live at all when I'm not with you.
Oh, darling... What I really wanna tell you is that...
That I shall lie awake in the dark and cry, because you're not here.
I'm lonely and frightened.
- Hurry, baby.
- Why? - Time to go. - Go where?
But I told you before, to the Villa Rossa.
- New girls. Everybody's going.
- Not me. But you must. It will be a fine party.
And, besides, I said you would go. I can't. I've got to write a letter.
Oh, to that little...
Every day, more letters. You might as well be married. That's my business.
Oh, baby. How you ever come back to me?
Serious like a shopkeeper with a liver.
Where is my war brother who used to get drunk with me and go to the Villa Rossa every night?
Why?
Isn't she just a girl? Keep her out of this.
Sacred subject. Believe me, baby, sacred subjects are not good for soldiers.
Why don't you be like me? All fire and smoke.
And nothing inside.
- Come on, baby.
- You're drunk, stop it.
Of course I am drunk! You come with me and you will be drunk, too. Come on, baby.
Oh, I am sorry. Now you must come.
There is no more ink. Get your hands off me and get out!
Poor baby.
Tomorrow I will get you drunk and I will take out your liver and I will put you in a good Italian liver and make a man of you again.
Ciao, baby.
You're going out, Signor Capitano?
- Yes, why?
- The mail just came, Signor Capitano. - You censor it.
- Signor capitano... The officers' mail, too?
Aren't you gonna open them, Signor Capitano?
No! I'm in a hurry.
- Send this one back.
- Yes, Signor Capitano.
I do not like to see him lose his head over a woman. Yes, Signor capitano.
And today my letters came back. Every one I'd ever written to her.
Came back? Just marked "Return to sender.
Person unknown." Well, that's very strange.
Thirty-two letters.
She never got one. - Well, that's why she never wrote you.
- No. She'd have written me anyway.
Something's happened to her. - Have you tried to...
- I can't get any information at all.
- I've got to go and find her myself. - How can you? I'm going to Milan.
I'll find her. But aren't all leaves of absence forbidden since that battle in the north began?
- I'm going anyway.
- No, that's desertion.
- I don't care, I'm going. - You'll be caught. - You mustn't do this, Frederico.
- Yes, I must. That's what I wanted to tell you, Padre.
What does this war mean to me any more?
What does anything mean, but finding her?
- But Frederico, consider the... - I can depend on you, Padre?
Say goodbye to Rinaldi and the others for me.
- When are you leaving? - Now. While they are at dinner.
And by morning, when they miss me, I'll be halfway to Milan.
If they ask me, what will I say? I... Anything you like.
Goodbye, Padre. Goodbye, Frederico.
May the Lord bless and preserve you.
What are you carabinieri doing in the yards?
- Looking for stragglers. - What do you do with them?
Send them back to fight invaders. Every foot of Italian soil must be regained.
Suppose they don't want to go back?
Then we shoot them.
- Catherine. - Who's that? Shh!
Where's Catherine? - What are you doing back here?
- Where's Catherine? I know.
You've run away.
You're a deserter.
- Where is she? I've got to see her. - You can't.
Where? - And you'd better get out.
- Has she been transferred?
- If you don't get out of here, I'll scream and bring the whole hospital down on you.
- Why'd she go.
Where?
Tell me. - No! - Tell me where she is!
You've done her enough harm.
- What do you mean? - I said you'd get her into trouble.
I hate you. Hate, you understand? I won't tell you anything.
Shh! I hope they catch you.
I hope they shoot you!
Pay you back for what you've done to her. Making her have a baby.
- Baby?
- I warned you, but you didn't care.
Not about her. - Now she's had to go away.
- Where? Where?
Oh, for pity's sake, tell me! Fergy! No, no!
No!
No! - We're coming, too! - Be careful, girls.
Where is he? And get me some clothes.
A full outfit.
I can't go around in this uniform. As long as I don't get mixed up in it myself.
You won't. I just want you to get some things, and put an advertisement in the newspaper for me.
I really oughtn't to, if I had any sense.
I know I shall have awful gas pains in the morning as a result of this.
Just say...
"Catherine, where are you? "I am free at last.
"Meet me at the Palace Hotel, Stresa." Signed "Frederic."
The Major made an obituary speech in your memory and the Priest,
- he wanted to say mass for your soul.
- But what... Vermouth. One for you?
Uh, two vermouth. You see, we all thought you were dead.
It never occurred to us that you might have be shell-shocked, wandered away, lost your memory.
How did you find me?
I saw your advertisement in the paper.
But as soon as we knew, we arranged everything.
Rinaldi will work on you one of his miraculous cures.
You will go back a hero. I'm not going back. They will decorate you for bravery.
They will even promote you. No. I'm through with the war.
Get that straight. But you cannot do that!
You cannot just stop and say, "I'm through with the war." - They will not let you do that. - Two vermouth.
Can I speak to you a moment, sir?
- It's all right, Harry, he's my friend. - But I, uh...
He keeps telling me that it's dangerous for me to stay here any longer.
The policeman was in tonight.
He spoke of notifying the carabinieri.
- When will they come? - Tonight, tomorrow, who knows?
But soon. My boat is still ready, sir.
If they arrest you, no one can save you.
- I know that. - They will shoot you.
Look... Get this through your head, I'm not going back!
I've got to wait here until I can find Catherine.
And how do you expect to do that?
I've got some people looking for her.
- If that is more important than...
- She's going to have a baby. My baby.
So...
And that means everything to you. Yes, it would.
It means that I've got to find her and get her out of Italy.
- Perhaps she's no longer in Italy. - What makes you say that?
She is in Switzerland.
Where? - Brissago.
- Brissago? Harry!
Will you do one for me, too?
Yes, madam. Step around here.
No. Just the head, please.
Isn't there any mail for me, yet?
Ah, madam! Yes, yes.
Today there are letters. - Many letters. - Many?
Well, that was worth waiting for...
It is up the lake and across.
- About 35 kilometres.
- I'll make it. At the frontier, there will be sentries.
- I know. - And you will have to watch out - for patrol boats.
- I will. - If it blows too hard, you... - I won't drown.
Have you enough money?
Here.
Won't you need it?
There must be a Villa Rossa in Pordenone.
Always the same girls until they become like old friends.
Like war comrades. Take it, baby, please.
Please. You're a good egg, Rinin.
No, I am not a good egg.
I am a fool.
But if I had understood how you felt about her...
Ciao, baby.
- Shall I get a new cylinder, Doctor?
- It is a new cylinder. Oh, I wanted so to have this baby and not make any trouble.
And now I'm all done.
All gone to pieces.
She is losing strength fast, Doctor.
There's no use. I'll have to operate.
That was lovely...
You mustn't worry, darling.
I'm not going to die now.
I got past the place where I was going to die.
Aren't you glad?
Of course you are not going to die.
You mustn't think about it.
- It's a caesarean. - We're lucky to be on time.
Is she going to be all right?
- Are you the husband? - Yes. She kept calling for you all night.
It would have been better if you'd been here.
I'm sorry. Is she in danger?
- She's very weak. - You don't suppose I could see her now? - Later, later.
- It won't be long.
She can't die.
Did you call?
No, I didn't say anything.
Not yet.
- Is she all right?
- I hope so.
The baby? A boy, but he was dead before she ever came in here.
Oh... But she'll be all right?
That's not in my hands any longer.
Better go across the street and get yourself some breakfast.
You look as if you need it. It will be some time before she can see you.
There's nothing there, dog.
You've had children?
What was it like? I beg your pardon? What did you say?
Nothing. Some coffee, please, and a brioche.
It's in the papers.
Italy has won! Thank God it's over.
This is the beginning of the end. But it will be a long time before they can rebuild what's been destroyed.
"In the early morning hours of November 4th,
"the armistice conditions laid down by the General Badoglio."
Don't let her die.
Oh, God, please don't let her die.
You took the baby... That was all right. But don't let her die.
Please, dear God, don't let her die.
Her husband's out there. Might as well let him in.
I knew he was coming.
You won't tell him, will you?
Tell him what? That I'm going to die.
- No, we won't tell him.
Doctor... Have I long?
Don't you see?
I have to know. Not long.
Let him come in.
Could I... Could I have my bag, first?
Oh! Such a mess.
He never liked me to be pale.
You can go in now.
- Catherine. - Darling.
- You're all right?
- I'm fine. Did you worry about me?
I came as soon as I found where you were.
Poor darling. Let me look at you.
Ah... Tut-tut. You're wet and tired.
Sit down, darling. Here...
You're going to be all right, Catherine.
Do you want me to do anything, Cat?
- Can I get you anything?
- No. Just talk to me.
Tell me you haven't stopped loving me.
You know I couldn't stop.
I like to hear you say it, though. I'll never stop loving you.
Never? Not even if I died?
Never.
You'd never do our things with any other girl, or say the same things, would you?
Never. I want you to have other girls, though.
That's right, dear. Try...
Try to sleep, Cat.
When I get well, we'll...
We'll take a little house in the mountains.
We always planned a house of our own, remember? I'll get you a fine house.
We'll live in it until the war is over.
Then you'll go back to America and be a splendid architect.
We'll be married all over again.
In a church. In a church.
Oh, darling!
I don't wanna die. - Don't let me die. - Cat!
Take me in your arms, hold me tight. - Don't let me go. - Catherine.
It's dark out there, and lonely. I don't wanna leave you any more.
I've been alone so much. You... You can't die.
You're a fine girl. A brave girl. Yes.
I am a brave girl.
Whatever happens, do not be afraid.
I'll not be afraid.
We've never been apart. Really.
Not since we met. Not since we met.
And never can be.
- Never parted. - In life and in death.
Say it, Cat.
In life and in death, we'll never be parted. You do believe that, don't you, Cat?
I believe it.
And I'm not afraid.
Peace...
- Hello.
Grand Hotel.
- The line is busy.
Who is this?
I can connect you with room service.
Hello.
Is that the clinic?
This is Senf, the head porter, Grand Hotel.
How's my wife?
Is she in pain?
Isn't the child coming soon?
Patience?
Would you have patience?
This is Otto Kringelein.
Is that you, Heinrich?
Listen.
I've got to talk very quickly.
Every minute costs 2 marks 90.
You know that will I made before I had my operation?
I want you to tear it up.
I came to Berlin to see a great specialist about that old trouble of mine, you know?
It's pretty bad, and he says I haven't long to live.
I say, he says I won't live much longer!
No, it isn't nice to be told things like that.
You plague, bother, and save, and all of a sudden you're dead.
I want to get something out of life.
I'm never going back to Friedersdorf.
Never.
I'm staying here at the Grand Hotel.
It's the most expensive hotel in Berlin.
All the best people stay here.
Even our big boss, Preysing, is staying here.
I'm going to tell him someday just exactly what I think of him.
Hello, miss.
This is General Director Preysing.
I want my home in Friedersdorf, please.
Hurry.
Hello.
Is that you, Mama?
How are the children?
What news have you from the factory, dear?
Is your papa there?
Good.
Hello, Papa, is that you?
The conference with the Saxonia company is set for tomorrow morning, Papa.
If the merger does not go through, we are in very bad shape, Papa.
Everything depends upon news from Manchester.
If the deal with the Manchester Cotton Company does not go through... we're facing a very bad situation, Papa.
I'm Suzette, Mme. Grusinskaya's maid.
Madame will not dance today.
She will not go to the rehearsal.
She did not sleep all night.
There is something preying on her mind.
I gave her a tablet, a Veronal.
She's sleeping now.
This is Baron von Geigern.
Look here, I need money, or I can't stay at this hotel much longer.
I've laid the groundwork.
I know the exact position of her room.
I've made friends with her ballet master, Pimenov.
Listen, Heinrich.
I've taken all my savings, everything... and I'm going to enjoy spending it.
All of it.
It's terribly expensive here, Heinrich.
But it's wonderful.
I can't!
I'll lose my job.
It's like being in jail.
Rely on me, Papa.
I will make this merger go through.
I never fail.
Poor Madame.
Her mind is tortured.
I'm afraid she will....
I don't need advice, thanks very much.
I need money!
Music all the time.
It's wonderful.
Grand Hotel.
People coming, going.
Nothing ever happens.
Mme. Grusinskaya will not want her car.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
- Here.
- Yes, Baron?
- Adolphus is very vexed with you.
- Yes, Baron?
You didn't take him for his walk this morning.
- Your door was locked.
- You might have knocked.
Don't you realize?
That's why they don't like little dogs in big hotels.
The doors are locked.
They can't get out.
You see?
- Yes, Baron.
- I want you to take him for a good walk.
- You understand?
- Yes, Baron.
- Don't bring him back till he's exhausted.
- No, Baron.
Wait a minute.
It's quite all right.
- Hello?
- Is that for me?
No.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Good evening.
Will you send this to Mme. Grusinskaya?
- Yes, Baron.
- Thanks very much.
Good evening.
My key, 168.
- Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
- Good evening, Baron.
- How is the beautiful lady?
- Grusinskaya?
To tell the truth, Baron, tonight we're a little bit nervous.
Were you at the theater last night?
I'm always there when Grusinskaya dances.
- Last night was not so good.
- I thought she was splendid.
Is Mr. Preysing in?
I'm Dr. Zinnowitz.
- Mr. Preysing.
Visitor.
- Mr. Preysing.
- Here you are.
- Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Waiting?
I've been waiting for news from Manchester.
- No news yet?
- No news.
That's bad.
You can't hold out unless you merge with the Saxonia company.
- I know.
- The Saxonia company will never sign... unless your firm is tied up with the Manchester people.
They don't have to.
I told you that.
Yes, I know.
I'm very much worried.
But I have my agent in Manchester.
I'm expecting a telegram any minute.
You have to create a good impression.
Seem optimistic.
Don't even mention Manchester to the Saxonia crowd.
Be clever.
No, I cannot do that, Dr. Zinnowitz.
I'm used to making my deals on a solid basis.
I'm an honest businessman, a good husband and a father.
I have nothing to conceal.
I could not live happily otherwise.
Yes, I know.
We'll go someplace and talk it over.
I'm expecting a stenographer.
Send her to Mr. Preysing's room. 166.
Yes, Dr. Zinnowitz.
- Letters for me?
- No, Doctor.
- Telegrams?
- No, Doctor.
He always seems to be waiting for something... but it never happens.
- No messages?
- No, Doctor.
Yes, I was in the war.
- Your bill, Baron.
- You're not beginning that again, are you?
Please pay some attention to me.
I've no time.
Kindly wait one moment, sir.
- Has anyone asked for me?
- No, Doctor.
We're holding the rooms now.
Five bedrooms, two sitting rooms.
- How many in your party?
- Let me see.
My mother, two sisters...
- Really, this is an imposition.
- Sir, kindly wait one moment, please.
- That makes nine.
- Yes, madam.
- You wish to have the rooms held?
- Yes, please.
And then...
Really, I won't wait any longer.
I've been here a very long time.
That's all right.
Look here, I waited three days before I got a room at all.
When I finally got one, what kind of a room was it?
- A very nice room, and inexpensive.
- I didn't ask you for a cheap room.
When I came here to live, did I ask you for a cheap room?
Did I?
- If you wait one moment, sir...
- I can't wait.
Every day is precious.
Every hour...
- 176?
- ...every minute is precious.
I came to live here for two weeks, maybe three.
Heaven only knows.
I can pay whatever you want.
I'm tired and ill.
I can't wait.
- The gentleman has a complaint?
- He is dissatisfied with Room 559.
Yes, I have a complaint.
I think it's a perfectly fair complaint.
I came here from a great distance to live at the Grand Hotel.
I want a room, a big room.
The same kind of room you'd give General Director Preysing.
I'm as good as Mr. Preysing.
I can pay for a room the same as Mr. Preysing.
Would you stick him way off in a corner in a little room... where the water pipes go "pop" all day?
He can have my room.
It doesn't matter where I stay.
That won't be necessary, Doctor.
Mr. Kringelein will take Room 176.
It's one of our most expensive rooms.
A large room on the front, and with a bar.
- With a private bar, exclusively mine.
- Certainly, sir.
Exactly what I want.
That's very kind.
I'll pay for it now.
- No, I beg of you, sir.
- Pardon me, sir.
You dropped your little hat.
- Permit me.
- Thank you.
Permit me. My name is Kringelein, from Friedersdorf.
- Yes.
I'm Baron von Geigern.
- A Baron.
Permit me to present Dr. Otternschlag.
A doctor.
Doctor, I'm ill.
I know.
When a man's collar is an inch too big for him, I know he's ill.
I must go and dress now.
- I hope to see you at the theater.
- Surely, sir.
- Is this gentleman a baron, too?
- Unfortunately, no.
- Will Mr. Kringelein kindly sign here?
- I have signed once.
- Have you a minute?
- I told you not to come into the lobby.
Time's getting short.
Haven't I told you not talk to me with a cigarette in your mouth?
- I want to speak...
- Later.
Yes, sir.
This way, Mr. Kringelein.
Mr. Preysing.
- Will you go up to 166?
- 166.
Hey, wait a minute!
Hello?
Mme. Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
She said, "On the other side of the fence."
Baron, you're incorrigible.
Poor Grusinskaya.
- How can she receive anyone?
She can't.
- No, of course not.
Theater, hotels, trains.
Trains, hotels, theater.
- Quite so.
- I must toddle along.
- She'll be waking up and calling for me.
- I'm sorry, old fellow.
Who are you, please?
I'm the stenographer.
Then you will please wait outside, please.
Yes, sir.
Outside, please.
Take your time.
Listen, the burial fund and everything. I've got it right here.
I'm going to live.
I'm going to have a good time while I can.
That's my creed, Kringelein:
a short life and a gay one.
A short life, Baron, and a gay one.
That's very true in my case.
You know, I know you won't think I'm impertinent... but perhaps you might have a little better time... if you bought some new clothes.
Started out fresh, so to speak.
Well, Baron, I didn't think there was time for that.
But it's very kind of you to take an interest.
- Friends, then.
- Friends, Baron?
Thank you.
- Your room is ready, sir.
- Thank you.
I may speak to the Baron anytime I see him?
Of course, Kringelein.
Why not?
I mean, when you're with your smart friends?
- I haven't any friends, Kringelein.
- You said me, Baron.
- Friend.
- Bless you, Kringelein.
See you later.
I've often wondered what would happen to that porter... if somebody jumped on him from here.
I'm sure I don't know.
Why don't you try it and find out?
- Thanks very much.
- Not at all.
- Don't you like dancing?
- No.
Not with strangers.
- Never?
- Never.
- Thanks very much.
- Not at all.
- I say....
- Are you back again?
He must be an awful nice fellow.
- Who?
- Whoever's keeping you waiting.
Have you seen it?
- Seen what?
- It.
You don't mean 166?
That fat, bulbous neighbor of mine, Mister....
- Preysing.
- Not you.
Oh, no.
Work.
- Does he sing?
- I hope not.
- Weren't you playing something?
- Yes.
The typewriter.
- You're a little stenographess.
- Yes, I'm a little stenographess.
That's fascinating.
I don't suppose you'd take some dictation from me sometime, would you?
- How about some tea, then?
- Tea would spoil my dinner.
I only have one meal a day, and I'd rather hate to spoil it.
- Are you reducing?
- Reducing?
Me?
Do I need to?
No.
It's perfect.
I don't think I've ever....
But why one meal a day?
- Money.
Ever heard of it?
- Yes, I have, vaguely.
But I always thought little stenographers made little pennies.
- Very little.
- That's too bad.
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on?
I have, indeed.
One she'd bought herself?
I see what you mean. Poor kid.
- I wish I were free tonight.
- Aren't you?
- What?
- Free.
No, darn it, I'm not.
But there's tomorrow.
- What time tomorrow?
- 5:00, downstairs.
Where downstairs?
In the funny yellow room where they dance.
You're funny.
- Tomorrow?
- Of course.
Really?
We'll dance?
All right.
We'll dance.
I wonder if I could remind the Baron of his promise... that I might speak to him at any time?
Mr. Kringelein, how are you making out in the royal suite?
- Wonderfully, thanks to the Baron.
- Baron?
- Are you a baron?
- Strangely enough, yes.
- Then this isn't the Baroness?
- Strangely enough, no.
- Do I look like a baroness?
- You're attractive enough to be anything.
Thank you, Baron.
You're nice.
- Thank you, Miss....
- Miss Flaemm.
- Miss Flaemm, this is Mr. Kringelein.
- Hello.
- They call me Flaemmchen.
- I like that better.
I wonder if the Baron would take the trouble to come to my beautiful room?
I've ordered some caviar and champagne.
It's very expensive, but that doesn't matter.
Perhaps Miss Flaemm would join us.
Have caviar, if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
It does, as a matter of fact.
I hadn't thought of that.
I'm sure my beautiful room... will appeal to your artistic sense.
It has real velvet upholstery.
A-number one.
I'm in the textile trade, and I know.
I wonder if you'd like to see my bathroom?
It has hot and cold running water all day.
Nighttime, too.
I can have a bath anytime that I like.
- No.
- Yes.
Stenographer.
Please.
Her master's voice.
Goodbye, Mr. Kringelein.
Thank you.
Goodbye, funny one.
Don't forget tomorrow. 5:00.
- I won't. Goodbye, you.
- Goodbye.
- What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
- Preysing.
- You know him, don't you?
- I know him?
I've slaved in that man's factory for years and years.
I know him through and through.
- Sorry, old man.
- I beg your pardon, Baron.
Excuse me.
Won't you join me in my room?
I've ordered some champagne.
Listen, I'd love to.
I'll join you a little later.
You know the gentleman we met downstairs, with the face?
- Who?
The doctor, you mean?
- Yes.
- He's a gay old blade, isn't he?
- He's wonderful.
Please, Messieurs, Madame is asleep.
See you later.
- Waiter!
- Please.
Sorry.
Has Madame slept well?
No, I've been awake, thinking.
It is time for the performance.
I think, Suzette...
I've never been so tired in my life.
Not even the Veronal can help me to sleep.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
- I can't dance tonight.
- It will pass, Madame.
Pearls are cold.
Everything is cold and finished.
So far away.
So threadbare.
The Russians.
Saint Petersburg.
Imperial court.
The Grand Duke Sergei....
Sergei... is dead.
It's all gone.
Mon Dieu.
The pearls, if they were to break....
The pearls don't break.
They hold together and bring me bad luck.
I hate them.
Orchids again, Madame!
No card.
I think they are perhaps from the same young man.
He is at the end of the corridor.
Tall. He walks like a soldier.
Madame must have noticed how often he rides in the elevator with us.
Yes?
Oui.
- Madame, the car is here.
- Send it away.
I shan't need it.
Mme. Grusinskaya will not require her car.
No.
She'll not be going to the theater.
- Time for the performance.
- The performance.
Poor little Lisebeta.
She still has her stage fright.
It will pass.
- It's not stage fright.
It's something more.
- What? What is it?
- Last night there was no applause.
- There was.
That theater, half empty.
Dancing for those few.
I was frantic.
I finished, I waited, I listened... but the applause did not come.
They're past, Pimenov. They're dead.
It's finished.
Meierheim.
Madame!
In negligée an hour before the performance.
What's this, you're canceling your car?
Do you know the time, or are we all mad?
Am I your manager?
Have we contracts?
Have we obligations?
- Is this the time, or I am blind?
- I'm canceling the engagement.
Madame is canceling the engagement?
Madame has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke.
Tonight there is a line in front of the theater since 6:00.
The house is jammed to the roof.
- Is it really full?
- Doesn't Meierheim say so?
Packed to the ceiling.
And such an audience:
the French ambassador, American millionaires, Princess Retski...
All right.
- Hurry, Suzette.
- We'll wait outside.
Poor child.
- How is the house?
- Terrible.
After this, no more ballets for me.
Jazz.
Just jazz.
If the house is empty again....
I don't know.
When she gets her paint on, hears the music, she'll be fine.
I know these people.
Here she is.
Why did you bring the pearls?
I said I won't wear them.
- Why not?
- Take them back.
- Hurry up.
- We haven't time.
I don't think I'll be able to join you fellows after all.
- Why not? We'll wait.
- Come on.
- Lift, please.
- Wait.
Can I help?
You go ahead, old man.
I'll be there if I'm up for it.
- We'll meet anyway.
- All right.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
The car is here, Madame.
Hello.
Fifth floor.
Good evening.
It's just 9:30, madam.
Yes.
I'll send them up at once.
- Is he in?
- The Baron?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Adolphus, I have something very serious to discuss with you.
When you meet lady dogs on the street that are not dachshunds... you must exercise some self-control.
We have company.
You're late.
The dancer's gone to the theater.
Excuse me, I'm busy.
This is a very peculiar thing for one gentleman to say to another... but as a matter of fact... you're the one thing in the world I really love.
She's gone to the theater.
Don't you know?
- What are you going to do?
- The pearls are in her room.
The others are getting suspicious.
I had Amsterdam on the phone.
They think you're scared.
I've been careful.
I'm waiting my chance.
Waiting your chance?
You're too much of a gentleman, that's the trouble.
I told you I'd get those pearls tonight, didn't I?
- Need any help?
- No.
Have you got the skeleton key?
- No.
- Why not?
One reason: there's a perfectly charming floor clerk outside who sees everything.
She'd see me enter her room.
- I can take care of her.
- How?
Chloroform on a handkerchief while you're on the job.
- No.
- Why not?
Poor kid. In the first place, it would give her a rotten headache.
I know all about chloroform.
I had it in the war.
Besides, she's rather pretty.
- She has a very nice line...
- You're no good for this business.
- No?
- To you it's just a joke.
I don't like your tone.
- No?
- No.
Get out.
Leave her to me.
Be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam.
- With the pearls.
- With the pearls.
Get out.
There is a nasty man, Adolphus.
He'd eat his young.
"Both parties have fully agreed that this merger can only result...
"in mutual advantages.
"Moreover...."
- Did you get that?
- Yes, I got it.
What did you say Zinnowitz called you?
Flaemmchen.
- Flaemm?
That's odd.
- What?
I mean, who were the gentlemen you were talking to in the corridor?
Some people I know.
- You know a lot of gentlemen, don't you?
- Oh, not many.
I haven't time.
I'm busy now looking for a job.
I'd love to be in the movies.
Why the movies particularly?
I mean....
"...only in mutual advantages.
Moreover...."
You're a very unusual stenographer.
You're pretty enough to do other things.
- I do.
- What?
You see, I have a rather nice figure, and I pose a lot.
Art studies, you know?
Like that?
I got 10 marks for it.
Is that you?
You?
Well, isn't that interesting?
- That's lovely.
- "Moreover...."
"Moreover, the possibility of the successful accommodation...
"for the Cotton Company...
"should throw a great weight into the balance...."
"Balance."
Your hands are sunburned, aren't they?
- Yes, that's from skiing.
- From skiing?
A friend of mine took me to Switzerland last month.
To Switzerland?
That must have been very nice.
I went to Florence once, too.
- With the same man?
- No.
Don't misunderstand me, Miss Flaemm.
I'm a married man and have grown-up daughters...
- All right.
- ...bigger than you are.
Come in.
That's all.
Excuse me, please.
"Deal with Manchester definitely off." Is that something terrible?
It doesn't mean that at all.
- That's a mistake.
That's wrong.
- All right. I'm sorry.
- Do you want to go on?
- No.
You come back in the morning... and we will go on with the dictation before the conference.
If you find out you won't need me in the morning...
I wish you'd please let me know... because men like you who come in and out of town are often unreliable.
After all, if I don't work tomorrow....
Well, good night.
"Deal definitely off."
Why, we could be smashed.
I'm going into 170 now, madam.
Hello?
No.
There's no one here.
You're late.
What have you been doing?
Everyone says, "Come back." They won't get out of their rooms.
Housekeeper speaking.
No, she isn't here.
- Western Theater?
- Have you seen Madame?
Hello.
Mr. Pimenov?
Have you found her?
No, she isn't here.
Yes, I know...
Pimenov?
What's happening?
No, I haven't found her.
Who's dancing?
Duprez?
How was it?
Good.
All right.
You keep the show going.
This trick is going to cost Madame a suit for breach of contract.
- Madame is ill.
Her nerves...
- What about my nerves?
Who is she?
Where does she think she is, Russia?
- I want to be alone.
- Where have you been?
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna contract.
I just want to be alone.
You're going to be very much alone, my dear Madame.
This is the end.
- Shall I....
Does Madame wish....
- No, Suzette.
All right.
Western Theater, please.
Mr. Pimenov, the ballet master.
Grusinskaya.
Hello, Pimenov.
I'm at the hotel.
I couldn't go on.
I couldn't.
How is it going?
Who's dancing?
Duprez?
Well, how is it?
I see.
They didn't miss me at all.
Good night, Pimenov.
They didn't even miss me.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I've finished.
Finished.
I always said I'd leave off when the time came.
And who would trouble about a Grusinskaya... who dances no more?
What would she do?
Grow orchids?
Keep white peacocks?
Die.
That's what it comes to at last: to die.
I'm not going to wait.
Don't be alarmed, Madame.
Who are you?
Someone who happened to be hiding in your room.
Why?
I often come here when you're at the theater.
Why?
Just to be alone in your room, to breathe the air you breathe.
There's no need to call for help.
Permit me. I couldn't help hearing.
I couldn't help knowing what you were about to do just now.
I could have left by the window, unnoticed, but I risked being discovered.
May I say something, Madame?
You're so beautiful.
It tore my heart to see you in despair like that.
What on earth have they been doing to you?
You've everything to live for.
Please don't cry anymore.
You must forgive me.
I've had a very trying evening.
I was so alone, and suddenly you were there.
Why do you look at me like that?
I had no idea you were so beautiful.
I'd like to take you in my arms and not let anything happen to you, ever.
How tired you are.
Yes, tired.
And alone?
So alone.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Strange man.
Am I so strange to you?
Maybe not so strange now.
You know, once, when the Grand Duke was alive...
I found a man hiding in my room, a young officer.
Later on, they found him dead.
Well, that was Russia.
- Who are you?
- Someone who can love you, that's all.
Someone who has forgotten everything else but you.
You could love me?
I've never seen anything in my life as beautiful as you are.
You must go now.
I'm not going.
You know I'm not going.
Please let me stay.
But I want to be alone.
That isn't true.
You don't want to be alone.
You were in despair just now.
I can't leave you now.
You mustn't cry anymore.
You must forget.
Let me stay.
Just for a little while.
Please let me stay.
For just a minute, then.
No, Doctor.
The champagne, and those girls and their dancing... those beautiful silver things, and the ice, and the caviar....
Oh, Doctor.
I don't care.
It's life.
Life.
Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- No. My room.
- Yes, Doctor.
Mr. Kringelein, you're drunk.
Life.
Grand Hotel.
Hello?
Grand Hotel.
Grand Hotel, good morning.
Baron von Geigern's room does not answer.
Yes, all right.
Baron von Geigern's chauffeur calling?
Grand Hotel, good morning.
930, Dr. Otternschlag.
No, Doctor.
No messages.
Grand Hotel, 820.
Grand Hotel, good morning.
Who is calling Mme. Grusinskaya?
Mr. Pimenov.
Mme. Grusinskaya cannot be disturbed.
Mr. Preysing's calls to 162 for the day.
- 162. - The conference room.
That is interesting.
A man in the textile industry must know Manchester.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company.
They have the whole English market right in their hands.
Have you any connections with Manchester?
We have a lot of good connections in England.
- Actually...
- I mean, with the Manchester people.
Please, we are here to discuss the merger.
Let us begin at the beginning.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
Is Baron von Geigern in?
Too bad.
Since June 11 this year, when the first negotiation...
I met him yesterday.
...between our respective firms...
I've got a date.
...that this merger can result....
About 5:00.
- ...all of us.
- Dancing.
- All we want to know about is Manchester.
- Just a second.
Before I get through, I'm laying before you here... the last general statement of the concern.
The capital, the plant, the machinery....
For instance, we'll take mop rags.
- I'll call you back.
- All we want to know about is Manchester.
Yes, Mr. Preysing, that's what we want to know.
I would rather wait for Justice Zinnowitz... before I commit myself, please.
Now, to go ahead with the merger.
You realize... that this merger is a great advantage to the Saxonians, of course.
Now, let's talk like adults.
- When you first approached us...
- We did not approach you.
This letter filed on September 15 indicates you approached us.
That letter is a response to a tentative feeler sent out by you.
- Please. - Tentative, my foot!
A month before this, your old father-in-law...
- comes to me privately, and scratches...
- Scratched?
- Why, we did not take the initiative!
- You did...
- We did not take the initiative!
- You took the initiative!
Gentlemen, I see the conference has already begun.
- I'm glad you're here, Justice Zinnowitz.
- Good morning.
- Thank you very much.
- I beg your pardon, please.
Excuse me, please.
I am glad you're here.
These gentlemen have cross words.
Would you try, Justice Zinnowitz...
- and iron out the situation here?
- Certainly.
- Right here, on the top. - If you will allow me.
Thank you.
Well, gentlemen, the situation seems to be perfectly clear.
- Yes.
And how clear is Manchester?
- Manchester?
Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
Why, no, sir.
I cannot commit myself at this time about Manchester.
Quite right.
Well, gentlemen, since June 11 of this year... when the first negotiations for a merger were entered...
Now we're going to begin at the beginning again.
As you remember it, when you approached us...
- We did not approach you.
- I'm sorry, you did approach us!
We did not approach you.
- You approached us!
- Please wait.
Can you imagine 100 girls in a ballet school... each thinking she would become the most famous dancer in the world?
I was ambitious then.
We were drilled like little soldiers.
No rest, no stopping.
I was little, slim, but hard as a diamond.
Then I became famous soon.
But why am I telling you all this?
Last night I didn't know you at all.
- Who are you, really?
- What?
I don't even know your name.
I am Felix Benvenuto Frihern von Geigern.
My mother called me Flix.
No.
Flix.
That's sweet.
And how do you live?
What kind of person are you?
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock.
I shall die on the gallows.
- Really?
- Really.
I haven't a bit of character.
None at all.
- No? - No.
Really.
You know, when I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman.
Then at school, to pray and lie.
And then in the war, to kill and hide.
That's all.
And what do you do now?
Now I'm a gambler... running at large, like a happy pig... devouring everything of life that pleases me.
I really belong in jail.
What a picture.
And what else?
What else?
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
That's not a funny joke.
You must believe one thing.
You must believe that I love you.
That I've never known love like this until now.
What is it, Flix?
What's the matter?
Hotel thief.
No.
Did you come here just for these?
That's horrible.
You may keep the pearls.
I don't want them.
I will not denounce you.
Hadn't you better go now?
I wanted money desperately.
Can't you understand that?
That's why I wanted your pearls.
I was threatened.
I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money.
I've been following you.
I've admired you.
But last night, at last, I managed to come into your room.
And now....
And now?
I couldn't go through with it.
Don't you understand?
Don't you?
- Who?
- Suzette, Madame.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Madame.
- Did Madame sleep well?
- Yes, Suzette.
Come back in five minutes.
I'll call you.
Five minutes.
There, it begins.
Hello, Pimenov.
Good morning.
Darling.
Beautiful morning.
Yes, very well.
Rehearsals?
All right, you can come.
Goodbye.
I have to go to rehearsals.
Our train leaves early tomorrow morning.
- Our train?
- Yes, for Vienna.
- Vienna?
- You're coming with me.
- Of course you are.
- But I can't.
I'd give my soul to go, but I can't.
- Why couldn't you?
- I'll try.
There might be some way.
- Flix, is it money?
- Of course.
I have money.
I have enough for both of us.
No.
That would spoil everything.
I'll manage somehow. I'll get it.
I have a whole day.
I'll be on the train.
I shall dance, and you'll be with me.
Then we'll go to Tremezzo.
I have a villa there.
The sun will shine.
I'll take a vacation, six weeks, eight weeks.
I don't know.
We'll be happy and lazy.
And then we'll go to South America.
It will be divine.
- Be careful going to your room.
- I'll be on the train with the money.
Don't do anything foolish.
- I'm alarmed about you.
- Don't worry.
I'll be on the train.
Hurry, Suzette.
A bright dress.
It's a sunny morning.
Meierheim is canceling the Vienna engagement.
Meierheim is mad.
You are mad.
We're all mad.
Suzette, come.
Gru, you're positively radiant.
Pimenov, I have an idea, a ballet.
It must have mad music....
But I'll speak with you later.
You go to the theater.
I want a full rehearsal, ballet, full orchestra....
- Come, Suzette.
- But, Madame....
Will you get me Baron von Geigern, please?
Yes.
Baron von Geigern.
Chéri, it's you.
No, nothing.
Good morning.
No.
Just to tell you that I'm happy.
I'll have something sweet and cold, please.
- Louisiana Flip, sir?
- Louisiana Flip?
Yes, that sounds very nice.
Thank you.
What do you do in the Grand Hotel?
Eat, sleep, loaf around... flirt a little, dance a little.
A hundred doors leading to one hall.
No one knows anything about the person next to them.
And when you leave, someone occupies your room... lies in your bed.
That's the end.
Let me say again, for the tenth time... you people were quite ready for the merger.
You declared yourself fully agreed on all the terms.
Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
I'll admit that we were at one time anxious for this merger.
But since then, the Preysing Company has fallen on evil days.
- Evil days?
- Very evil days.
Say, listen.
Haven't I just shown you here... what my firm exports to the Balkans?
50,000 marks worth of mop rags each and every year.
Mop rags.
We're interested in something entirely different.
- What?
- Shall I tell them again?
Why waste time?
It's getting late.
- You see...
- We're going home.
But Mr. Preysing has too great a regard for the certainty...
You've been talking all day.
You're hoarse now.
Good night, Preysing.
You have decided against the merger?
- Yes.
- The deal is off?
Yes.
- Here's your coat, sir.
- Thank you.
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.
Preysing, I hope you pull through.
It's a very bad time to be in such a crisis.
Sorry.
- Dining in town?
- No, I have to get my train.
Here!
So you're breaking off the negotiations.
All right.
But don't you think for one moment that I'm such a fool... as not to have something to say about Manchester.
What?
Manchester?
No.
The deal is over.
Good night, gentlemen.
If you have something definite to say about Manchester, we might...
I'm at liberty to announce at this time that the deal between my firm... and the Manchester Cotton Company... has been successfully negotiated.
Are you joking?
Under those circumstances....
- Where are those articles?
- I thought it was all over.
Under these circumstances, it's a different matter.
Yes, but under these circumstances we might refuse to sign now.
Now, come, come.
Business is business.
Now, I'll sign in here.
Preysing, you sign here.
We should celebrate this with a bottle of wine.
Good night.
We'll see you next week and settle all the details.
- Next week.
Yes.
- Come on.
Good night, Preysing.
You're a sly one.
- Dr. Waitz?
- Yes.
I'll be at your office tomorrow.
You let me talk myself hoarse... and you had Manchester signed up all the time.
Why?
- The deal has been put through.
- Yeah.
The deal has been put through.
- What's the matter with you?
- Here.
"Deal with Manchester definitely...
"definitely off." Preysing!
Yes, if that's what the world wants, bluff...
I can be just as big a bluff as anyone.
You must go to England yourself at once and really see this through!
Yes, I must go to England.
I was desperate.
I didn't know what I was doing.
Now I don't care.
This thing goes to a man's head.
- What you need is some relaxation.
- Yeah!
That's it!
I want to break loose.
I want to drink.
I want to maybe go dancing.
I want to do anything.
I can understand that, after this....
Yes, go on, say it.
My lie.
But that's the first time in 30 years that....
Where is my stenographer?
Miss Flaemm?
- What do you want with her?
- Pardon?
- What do you want?
- What?
Here.
I want to do some dictating.
I want to tell my father-in-law about...
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at 5:00.
She was in a hurry.
- In the Yellow Room?
- Yes.
Do you think that she's pretty?
- Pretty as a picture.
- You think so?
Let's go find her.
We'll go get a drink.
- You come along, Zinnowitz.
- Yes.
I don't know much about women.
I've been married for 28 years, you know.
Come along, Zinnowitz.
- Good evening, Mr. Kringelein.
- Good evening, Miss Flaemm.
- Have you seen the Baron?
- I'm waiting for him.
I've been with him all day.
We had a marvelous time.
We were in a motor car, 100 miles an hour, in an airplane.
- Really?
- We had a marvelous time.
My, how you've changed.
You look awfully nice.
Thank you, Miss Flaemm.
I had a manicure, too.
Really?
I'm sorry, Miss Flaemm.
Would you have something to drink?
A Louisiana Flip.
Louisiana Flip, please.
- Absinthe.
- Oh, that.
- You like music, Mr. Kringelein?
- Yes.
I love it.
It's so stimulating.
- A man could...
- A man could what?
- He could do almost anything.
- He could.
- Hello, funny one.
- Hello.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Baron, won't you have a drink?
- A Louisiana Flip.
- Mr. Kringelein, how are you now?
I feel a little strange, Baron.
- I'd given you up.
- Sorry.
Please, Baron, do have a drink.
A Louisiana Flip.
No, thanks, old man.
I'm keeping my head clear.
- Dance, then?
- What?
- Dance?
- Yes, I'd love to.
- Watch this, will you, Mr. Kringelein?
- I really ought to learn to dance.
I suppose it's very important.
Yes, you should learn as quickly as the time allows.
Believe me, Mr. Kringelein, a man who is not with a woman... is a dead man.
- What have you been doing all day?
- Chasing around.
- Chasing what?
- Money.
- You were very different yesterday.
- That was yesterday.
I served as a surgeon in the Great War... till the end.
Grenade in my face.
I carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound till 1920.
Isolated two years.
- Drink, Mr. Kringelein.
- Yes.
That was lovely.
Listen, funny one, do you want to make a man happy?
- I'd love to.
- Dance with old Kringelein.
Why?
I don't know.
He's a dear old duck.
I feel rather sorry for him, don't you?
You know, you're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Yesterday?
No, perhaps not.
I fell in love last night.
The real thing.
There's no real thing.
It just doesn't exist.
I thought that, too.
But now I know that it does.
It's wonderful.
Come along.
- Dance with old Kringelein?
- Of course.
Anything for you.
You're sweet.
Here you are.
I must speak with you.
- Presently, Mr. Preysing.
- No, now. This is very urgent.
This lady has urgent business with me at the moment.
Insolence.
Berlin manners.
Good evening, Mr. Preysing.
You're staying here, too?
- I'm sorry, but I cannot place you.
- Kringelein, at the plant.
One of our agents.
No.
Assistant bookkeeper, Room 23, Building C, third floor.
- I am away, sick. - That's very interesting.
Good day.
Would you like to dance with me, Mr. Kringelein?
Miss Flaemm, I've never danced in public.
- Come along and try it.
- I'd be afraid.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
You'll love it.
Miss Flaemmchen, I must speak to you.
This is about a dictating job.
- When do we start?
Tomorrow morning?
- No, right now.
We were just going to dance.
Do you know each other?
Mr. Kringelein, Mr. Preysing.
Mr. Kringelein would be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
I couldn't think of not accepting the invitation to dance.
I understood you to say that you reported to our plant ill... and you're here in Berlin indulging in diversions... which are very much beyond your means?
This is very extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein.
I think we should look over your books.
Come along now, children.
No fighting.
Save that for the office.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
Haven't I got any right to live?
I will wait 10 minutes for you.
If you're not back, it will be necessary to engage someone else.
What happened to your dance?
We're going now, thank you, Baron.
Come along.
I shall remember this, Mr. Kringelein.
Let the poor devil alone.
Death's staring him in the face.
I did not ask your advice.
I think you'd better go away.
We will see who will remain here the longer.
Baron von Geigern, please.
Mr. Kringelein, you must look at my face, and not the floor.
Yes.
- Why, you're trembling.
- I never danced in public before.
- You dance beautifully.
- Thank you.
- That's right.
- I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Are you really?
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
Are you all right?
Yes.
Excuse me, I just stopped a second.
All right.
Here we go.
I'm very tired.
Do you mind if we stop?
Thank you.
- I must go back to Mr. Preysing now.
- Must you?
Yes, business.
One has to earn a living, you know.
Not you, Miss Flaemm.
Just another desk slave.
Money.
- I'm glad you're here, Miss Flaemm.
- Here I am.
- Did you enjoy your dance?
- Yes, thank you.
- Excuse me.
Go away, please.
- Where's the Louisiana Flip?
- Would you like a little cognac?
- Yes.
You wanted to see me?
Yes.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Mr. Preysing, I am not taking orders from you here.
What is this insolence?
Please go away.
You think you have free license to be insulting?
Believe me, you have not.
You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man... even if you did marry money... and people like me have got to slave for you... for 320 marks a month.
- Go away, please.
You are annoying.
- You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
When a man's working himself to death, that's what he's paid for.
You don't care if a man can live on his wages or not.
You have a very regular scale of wages, and there's the sick fund for you.
What a scale, and what a fund.
When I was sick for four weeks... you wrote me a letter telling me I'd be discharged... if I were sick any longer.
Did you write me that letter or not?
I have no idea of the letters that I write.
I know that you are here in the Grand Hotel, living like a lord.
You are probably an embezzler.
- An embezzler!
- Yes, an embezzler.
You are going to take that back!
Right here in the presence of this young lady!
Who do you think you're talking to?
You think I'm dirt?
If I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier...
Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing!
- You're discharged.
Get out!
- You can't do that to him.
I don't know the man or what he wants.
I never saw him before.
I know you.
I've kept your books for you, and I know all about you.
If one of your employees was half as stupid in a small way...
- as you are in a big way...
- What do you mean?
Gentlemen, please!
Please!
Stop that!
- You're discharged!
Do you hear?
- Wait!
You can't discharge me.
I'm my own master... for the first time in my life.
You can't discharge me.
I'm sick.
I'm going to die.
You understand?
I'm going to die, and nobody can do anything to me anymore.
Nothing can happen to me anymore.
Before I can be discharged, I'll be dead!
The man's crazy.
I don't know him.
He's annoying.
- Baron!
- Excuse me.
- What is it?
What's happened to him?
- He's ill.
- I'm sorry, Baron.
- Poor old Kringelein.
You're all right.
- Give him some whiskey.
- No.
A Louisiana Flip.
Five minutes to 7:00.
Time drags when you're tired.
I was in the hospital the whole night, walking up and down the corridor.
They wouldn't let me see her.
And I have to stay chained to this desk.
Did you find that young lady for Mr. Preysing?
- His secretary.
Yes, they're over there.
- That's all.
His secretary.
Come on, waiter.
- Would you like a little cognac?
- No, nothing.
Nothing?
- One cognac for me.
- Very good, sir.
You wanted to see me?
Yes.
Pardon me.
I must go to England.
It's very important.
I must go at once.
I have some very big deals... involving hundreds of thousands of marks... and I thought I would take along a secretary... to take care of my correspondence.
You know what I mean.
I understood you to say that you traveled and....
You understand?
I understand you perfectly, Mr. Preysing.
What would you want for such a trip?
- Marks?
You mean money?
- Yes.
I don't know.
I'd have to figure it up.
I'd need clothes and shoes... and it's cold in England in March.
- You'd want me to look nice?
- Of course, Miss Flaemm.
Yes, I thought you would.
I should say 1,000 marks.
- Is that too much?
- No.
That is all right.
Would you like me to get you a room here... at the hotel?
Now?
- And that would...
- Hello, Baron.
- Would you please pay some attention?
- I'm paying attention.
- How do you do?
- Insolence.
You mean the Baron?
- Baron what?
- What?
He's a gentleman.
Is the Baron tired?
No, not tired exactly.
I thought this evening we could go to the casino.
That place we passed with the wonderful bright lights.
Kringelein, I'd adore it.
I can't go anywhere.
- What?
- I'm broke.
- No, you're joking.
- Yes.
Isn't it odd?
A baron, broke.
Excuse me, old man.
- I quit.
- You can't.
I'm not getting those pearls, neither are you.
- What about the money?
- I'll pay you back.
- How?
- I have an idea working in my head.
You might find a bullet through that head.
If you do that you'll get nothing, except maybe the police after you.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car!
If you wait, I'll pay you back your 5,000...
I'll see you later.
Go on, Suzette.
Are you coming to the theater?
I shall dance tonight.
How I shall dance!
I want to feel that you're there.
I came too far.
- I'm worried about you.
- Don't be.
- You'll be on the train?
- Yes.
- Until then.
- Bless you.
- Was the Baron joking?
- What?
- Is it really true?
- What are you talking about, Kringelein?
Is the Baron really in financial straits?
To tell you the truth, I must get some money somehow right away.
- If the Baron will permit me.
- What?
I'd be awfully glad to oblige.
You've been very decent to me.
Three hundred?
If I could get into a game of some kind, I think I might win.
Gambling!
I'd love that!
I've got over 6,800 marks right here.
If we could scare up some men to play.
- We could go up to my room.
- That's a grand idea.
Come on.
- Cab, miss?
- What?
- Cab?
- No, thanks.
I'll walk.
- 4,000 marks.
- 4,000!
Too high?
4,000 marks.
- Want a card?
- Please.
Thanks.
- 8,000 marks.
- 8,000!
- I take it all.
- That's a lot of money.
I need it, thanks.
- Want a card?
- Please.
Baccarat.
Too bad there.
- Now, Mr. Kringelein.
- Baron!
Will you help me again, please?
I think you'd better help me, Kringelein.
- Make your bets, gentlemen.
- How much shall I bet?
- How much is left in the bank?
- 2,500 uncovered.
- Do you feel like going that far?
- All that money, Baron?
Come on, you're killing them tonight.
Go ahead, old man.
Do you want a card?
What have you got?
The old highwayman.
He has nine again.
I win again!
Come on, gentlemen.
Please drink!
Drink.
It's wonderful and sweet champagne!
Mr. Kringelein, care to take the bank?
Yes!
Surely.
I'll take everything.
I'll take anything.
Come on, now.
Drink, gentlemen.
Please drink some champagne.
It's expensive and good.
What will I take the bank for?
- I'll play for 500.
- Baron, all at once?
Suppose you lose it?
It's all the same thing, Kringelein.
Come on, now, old man.
Deal me two cards.
One to me first.
One to yourself.
One to me.
One to yourself.
Baron, if all that money....
What have you got?
I've got a nine!
Isn't that a wonderful thing?
Kringelein, you old robber, you're hopeless.
Baron!
Baron, please.
It's no use, old man.
It's sweet of you...
- but you have all the luck.
- It's true.
I have luck, for the first time in my life!
I have luck!
Baron, are you out?
Have you finished playing?
Yes, thank you.
I'll recover again presently, in 10 or 20 years.
Look, Doctor.
I've won again!
There you are.
Baron, I win and drink, and drink and win!
Gentlemen, please don't go.
Be my guests. Don't go.
I beg your pardon.
I know I oughtn't to presume, but I'm so grateful to you.
It's been so marvelous.
For the first time in my life, I've gambled and I've danced.
You gentlemen can laugh... but for the first time in my life, I've tasted life!
- Splendid!
- Life is wonderful, but it's very dangerous.
If you have the courage to live it, it's marvelous.
- Wonderful!
- You don't know about that.
You're healthy and happy.
But I, believe me... if a man doesn't know death, he doesn't know life.
- It's a short life, but a gay one.
- Please, gentlemen, don't go.
Come on.
Drink to life... to the magnificent, dangerous... brief, wonderful life.
- Kringelein!
- And the courage to live it.
You know, I've only lived since last night... but that little while seems longer than all the time that's gone before.
All of....
Take him over to his bed.
Turn him around.
How is he, Doctor?
- It will be over in a minute.
- Over?
- It's only just begun.
- Quiet, Kringelein.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid, Doc.
- I'm not afraid to die.
- There, there.
You'll be all right.
Too much iced champagne.
- What?
- Hello, Baron.
Hello, Kringelein.
You old drunkard.
It's late.
- What is it?
- My pocketbook.
I've lost my pocketbook.
14,000 marks in that pocketbook.
- I've got to find it.
- No, stay where you are.
No, I've got to find that.
- Kringelein!
- 14,000 marks.
14,000 marks were in that pocketbook.
I can't see anything.
You don't know what that money means to a man like me.
You've never lived like a dog in a hole... and scrimped and saved.
You did not see his pocketbook, did you, Baron?
No.
My life hangs on that money, Baron.
Nobody ever gives you anything for nothing.
You have to buy everything, and pay cash for it.
I wanted to pay for my last days with that money.
I must find it!
I haven't anything in the world but that pocketbook!
Every hour costs money.
I must find it!
Here's your pocketbook, you silly old thing.
- There's your money.
- You found it!
That's it.
You found it.
I'm very glad he got it back. 14,000 marks.
Yes.
It's a lot of money, isn't it?
- Good night, Kringelein.
- Don't go, Baron.
Don't leave me.
- I must, old man.
It's late, I'm sorry. - No.
Please don't go!
I must, old man.
It's late.
Good night.
Good night, Kringelein.
Stay a while, Baron.
I'm sorry.
I can't, old man.
I have no time.
Wait a minute.
- Hello, funny one.
- Hello.
What are you doing here at this time?
Looking for my room. 164.
- Do you live here?
- Yes, for tonight.
Such is life, Flaemmchen.
You're nice.
Good night... funny one.
Good night.
Come on.
- Thank you, madam.
Good night.
- Good night.
You were superb tonight.
What a success!
Yes.
It was a triumph, wasn't it?
Madame will return to Berlin soon?
Who knows, monsieur?
Do be sensible.
Shall I come and talk about the music now, or not?
No.
Not tonight.
Pimenov, go and find him.
- Flaemmchen.
- Hello.
I've been waiting in there for you.
I had to arrange about the trip.
- You're very sweet.
- Thank you.
Won't you sit down?
You know, you are entirely different from what I expected.
- Different?
How?
- I don't know.
I thought you were more of a coquette... not so ladylike.
What did you expect?
Wouldn't you like to call me by the first name?
No, I couldn't do that.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
One can't get intimate just offhand.
I could go to England with you and all that, but....
I always say that nothing should be left hanging over.
And names are like that.
Supposing I met you next year and I said:
"How do you do, Mr. Preysing."
And you said, "That's the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester."
That's all quite proper.
But supposing I saw you and yelled:
"Hi, baby!
Remember Manchester?"
And you were with your wife.
How would you like that?
We will leave my wife out of this, Flaemmchen, please.
- Sorry.
- I didn't mean that.
You are very slender, aren't you?
- Think so?
- Are you going to be nice to me?
Yes.
- Very nice?
- That's what you expect, isn't it?
You like me just a little bit, don't you?
You're still a stranger to me, but that doesn't matter.
It's you, Baron.
What are you doing in this room here?
- This your room, Preysing?
- Yes, this is my room.
Sorry.
I must've made a mistake.
We shall see whether you made a mistake or not.
That door is locked, Baron.
Yes.
I came through here.
Here.
I want that pocketbook.
- What do you mean?
- I want that pocketbook.
Give it to me!
- Certainly.
- So that's how we stand, Baron.
Look here, Preysing...
I'm completely at your mercy.
I was desperate.
It's a matter of life and death.
I had to get some money tonight, somehow.
Yes, you did have to get some money tonight... but you're going to jail.
You're going to be locked up.
- Why, you're a thief!
- Be quiet.
Quiet?
Yeah, quiet!
You danced with Flaemmchen when I wanted to transact business with her.
You, the nice friend of the nice Mr. Kringelein.
- Do you want to wake up the entire hotel?
- I will wake up the hotel!
I'll show them what a baron you are.
You are a thief!
I'll have you locked up.
Here, you wait here.
Thief!
You!
Strike me, would you?
Hello.
Operator.
Operator.
They're having a nice little game up there with that telephone.
Oh, God.
Baron!
Speak to me!
Baron.
He tried to rob me.
He's a thief.
Here, Miss Flaemm.
Miss Flaemm, please don't leave me.
Please, Miss Flaemm.
- Look!
- What a grand hotel!
- Hurry up.
They're waiting.
- She was in a hurry.
No wonder she was running.
Mr. Kringelein!
Wake up!
Hear me?
Wake up!
- The Baron.
- The Baron?
Go quickly.
The Baron.
Do you hear me?
- Where?
- Preysing's room.
Hurry!
Here. Take it.
You thief, you.
I must get out of here.
Mr. Kringelein, he robbed me.
He struck me.
He's dead.
Baron.
Dead, just like that.
Look.
His eyes are still open.
He looks so peaceful.
It can't be so hard to die.
That pocketbook he stole from me.
It's just like it was.
I haven't touched nothing.
Maybe he did try to take your pocketbook... but you don't kill a man for that.
You don't kill a man about a pocketbook.
Poor Baron, he wanted money so badly.
- Where is Miss Flaemm?
- I'll take care of her.
That's it.
She's working with that man.
She enticed me into her room while he robbed me here.
- I'll tell that to the court.
- To the court?
Yes.
Mr. Kringelein, I must talk with you before the police come.
Miss Flaemm is in your room?
- Yes.
- She's in your room.
No one will know that I was with her.
You were with her.
They will not interrogate you.
They will not ask you any questions.
You cannot give no testimony.
Neither can she say anything.
But what you are proposing is falsification of the evidence.
My existence is hanging by a thread.
A scandal with that woman would mean ruin for me.
- But you've just killed a man!
- That makes no difference!
I beg your pardon.
It makes all the difference in the world.
- We're going to call the police.
- No!
Please, Mr. Kringelein.
I will give you money, anything.
You can go away.
Please.
- I have enough money.
- Mr. Kringelein, please help me.
- My life is in your hands.
- Your life.
What about my life, when you had it in your hands?
But I can send you back to Friedersdorf.
I can give you a very good position in Friedersdorf.
Many, many thanks, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing...
- but I am never going back to Friedersdorf.
- Don't, please.
Worry about yourself.
Don't worry about me.
No, Mr. Kringelein, please don't call...
Hello!
There's been a murder here.
I don't understand you.
Murder?
- They're drinking.
- What?
Yes.
What is it?
Is this a joke?
Hello.
Hurry up.
Someone in 166 says there's been a murder.
166?
Preysing?
I'll attend to it.
- What time is it, Suzette?
- It's 3:00 in the morning, Madame.
Tired, Suzette?
- Is Madame not tired?
- No, Suzette.
- Madame has changed her dress again.
- Yes, Suzette.
The music has stopped.
How quiet it is tonight.
It was never so quiet in the Grand Hotel.
Those flowers make me think of funerals.
- Don't they you, Suzette?
- It's just nerves, Madame, nerves.
Suzette, we're going to take a holiday soon.
Six weeks in Tremezzo.
I'm going to live like a real woman... perfectly simple, perfectly quiet, perfectly happy.
- Yes, Madame.
- We'll have a guest.
Certainly, Madame.
But Madame must sleep now.
The train will soon go.
I suppose so.
Call Baron von Geigern's room, please.
Keep ringing.
He must be asleep.
Come and fetch me, chéri...
I'm longing for you.
I haven't been asleep.
I kept thinking that you might come to me.
But he must answer.
Ring!
Why don't you answer the phone, please?
Yes.
Yes.
Ring.
Where are you?
Thirty-four!
Thirty-six.
Thirty-eight.
Forty.
- Forty-two.
- Let's go to work, boys.
Forty-four.
Forty-four, forty-six pounds.
Forty-eight.
- Are these things necessary?
- I'm afraid so, Mr. Preysing.
All right.
We've taken care of all that, Mr. Preysing.
The night porter's gone.
You're late.
I was at the clinic the whole night.
- My wife, poor girl.
- The child hasn't come yet?
No.
But I mustn't let it interfere with my duty.
- You won't forget that?
- No, sir.
- I'm going now.
- Yes, Doctor.
- What's this?
- A killing in 166.
Killing?
Who?
The big manufacturer Preysing killed Baron von Geigern.
Good heavens!
What for?
- I don't know.
- That's terrible!
- He was a nice fellow.
- They say he was a thief.
I don't believe it.
He was a real gentleman.
I know people.
I'm so tired I can't hardly see out of my eyes.
No sleep for two nights, here all day, and now this killing at the hotel.
Halt!
Front!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Show your hands.
Hands.
Over.
- Change those gloves.
- Yes, sir.
- Down.
- Dismissed.
Too bad about the Baron.
You always felt better when he came along.
- Always friendly, such an agreeable fellow.
- I'll tell you a funny thing about...
Be quiet.
Good morning, madam.
Where are you taking that dog?
- Baron von Geigern.
- Give it to me.
Better take charge of this dog.
It belonged to the Baron.
Yes, sir.
- They have taken him away? - Yes.
Wasn't it terrible?
Madame must not know.
You understand?
Madame must not know!
All right, I can tell it to the maids, but I can't answer for downstairs.
- Are you all right, Miss Flaemmchen?
- Yes.
I was just thinking about the Baron.
Lying there, with his eyes so open.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
So did I.
He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
What if he was a burglar?
- They don't kill a man for that.
- He was desperate.
He was?
He tried to raise money all day.
And he laughed, poor devil.
And a man like Preysing has to kill him.
You know, I didn't like Preysing right off.
Why did you have anything to do with him?
- Money.
- Money.
- You don't understand that, do you?
- Yes, I do.
- Do you really?
- Yes, I do.
I could take care of you, Miss Flaemmchen, if you'd let me.
I have enough money.
There's 10,200 marks in this pocketbook... and there's 3,400 that I won last night.
That would last a long time.
I could win some more.
We could travel.
- Travel?
- Yes, to Paris.
- I've always wanted to go to Paris.
- Anywhere you like. Here.
I'll give you this money I won last night. 3,400...
- and then later you can have some more.
- Later?
Yes, when I....
I'm ill, Flaemmchen.
I won't live long.
Will you stay with me?
That's nonsense!
We'll find a great doctor.
He'll cure you.
- They can cure anything these days.
- You think so?
Of course.
You'll see. Here.
Do you think you'd have as good a time with me... as you did with Preysing?
- Why, of course.
- Really?
- Yes.
- You like me better than you did him?
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein.
A very good man.
You know, I never thought anything so beautiful could come to me.
We'll catch the first train to Paris.
Order two tickets now.
Come on.
I can't.
Hello, porter?
Yes, please.
I'd like two tickets to Paris.
Yes.
What time does the next train leave?
Pimenov.
- He'll be on the train.
- But how do you know?
Baron von Geigern has left?
When?
How long ago?
The Baron left about half an hour ago.
Gru, come, come. We'll lose the train.
Come along.
Here you are, sir.
I'm sorry.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car.
Come along, the train will be going.
- What is it, Gru?
- Please come, madam, please.
- I'll ask myself.
- What is the use of asking?
- He'll be on the train.
He'll be there.
- Have you seen Baron von Geigern?
The Baron is not here, madam.
- Has he gone?
- Yes, madam.
- We haven't any time to waste.
- He'll be on the train.
We have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow.
The sun.
It'll be sunny in Tremezzo.
We'll have a guest, Suzette.
Yes?
Grand Hotel!
The Grand Hotel, sweetheart.
This way, precious.
Take the car to the garage.
Take the bags in, please.
Come, darling.
Good morning.
- Will you kindly register?
- Certainly.
- Mr. and Mrs. Hoffman.
- Head porter's desk.
Mr. Senf?
Just a moment.
Hospital.
Hello.
Yes, head porter.
Yes.
What?
- Yes.
- What's the matter?
The child has come.
It's a boy.
- And your wife?
- My wife is well.
Hello.
Hospital?
I'll be with you on lunch hour.
These rooms are not taken.
176, 170, 168, 166.
- Is Your Excellency leaving?
- A cab, please.
- A cab for His Excellency.
- My bill, and the lady's, too.
- Have you got your tickets?
- My tickets.
- Tickets for Mr. Kringelein.
- Thank you.
Your forwarding address?
The Grand Hotel, in Paris.
How do you know there will be one?
There's a Grand Hotel everywhere in the world.
- Goodbye, Mr. Kringelein.
- Goodbye, Doctor.
Pain's gone already?
Pain.
I have none, Doctor.
Goodbye.
My luggage.
- Telegram.
- I beg your pardon.
Where's the money?
Hurry. We'll miss that train.
Got your bags now?
Come along.
Here you are.
- Come on.
- Goodbye, Your Excellency.
- Goodbye!
- Your hat, sir.
Goodbye.
I'm coming.
Please be careful of that.
Friedrichstrasse Station.
Grand Hotel.
Always the same.
People come, people go.
Nothing ever happens.
Subtitles conformed by SOFTITLER
Trying to teach me a lesson in patience, Sir Joseph?
Method is everything in archaeology.
We always deal with our finds of the day in order.
Well, it seems to me that that box we dug up today, with the very peculiar gentleman over there, is the only find we've made in two months that'll bring this expedition medals from the British Museum.
We didn't come to dig in Egypt for medals.
Much more is learned from bits of broken pottery than from all the sensational finds.
Our job is to increase the sum of human knowledge of the past, not to satisfy our own curiosity.
Oh, that's all very true, Sir Joseph, but, after all, we're human.
- And a find like this!
How can you wait?
- This is your first trip.
I've been here ten years.
I'm more curious about the mummy than you.
And even more about that box.
- Whemple.
- Yes?
The viscera were not removed.
The usual scar made by the embalmer's knife is not there.
I guessed as much, Muller.
I had a good look at him when I photographed him.
Never saw a mummy like that.
Neither, I imagine, has anyone else.
Looks as though he died in some sensationally unpleasant manner.
The contorted muscles show that he struggled in the bandages.
Buried alive?
"Imhotep".
"High Priest of the Temple of the Sun at Karnak".
Poor old fella. Now, what could you have done to make 'em treat you like that?
An execution for treason, I suppose.
Sacrilege, more likely.
Look. Sacred spells which protect the soul in its journey to the underworld have been chipped off the coffin.
So Imhotep was sentenced to death not only in this world, but in the next.
Maybe he got too gay with the vestal virgins in the temple.
Possibly. The priestesses of the Temple of Karnak were daughters of the Pharaoh.
They were the secret virgins of Isis.
Maybe the answer's in that box we found buried with him.
I see I shall get no more work out of you until after it's open.
- Come on.
- Let's have the box.
Oh dear.
The wood's so rotten it'll fall apart at a touch.
Whatever it is, it's terribly heavy.
Metal. Looks like copper.
It's gold.
I say. Look here.
The unbroken seals of the Pharaoh Amenophis.
Some temple treasure.
"Death, eternal punishment, for...
anyone... who... opens... this... casket."
"In the name of Amon-Ra, the king of the gods."
Good heavens, what a terrible curse!
- Well, let's see what's inside!
- Wait!
You will break the curse.
We recognise your mastery of the occult sciences, Muller.
But your beliefs can't interfere with my work.
- Then why did you send for me today?
- As a friend and an expert.
This find was unique and I wanted your opinion.
- It's providential that you did.
- Oh, come, Dr Muller.
Surely a few thousand years in the earth take the mumbo jumbo off any old curse.
Oh, I cannot speak before a boy.
Come out under the stars of Egypt.
Do not touch that casket.
Go on with your cataloguing. We'll open it later.
Don't think you can persuade me not to examine the most wonderful find of my whole experience out here.
If you are right about the legend, then this casket may contain the Scroll of Thoth, from the holy of holies in the temple, and I can hardly wait to get back to find out.
The gods of Egypt still live in these hills, in their ruined temples.
The ancient spells are weaker, but some of them are still potent.
And I believe that you have in your hut the Scroll of Thoth itself, which contains the great spell with which Isis raised Osiris from the dead.
Put it back. Bury it where you found it.
You have read the curse. You dare defy it?
In the interests of science, even if I believed in the curse,
I'd go on with my work for the museum.
Come back with me and we'll examine this great find together.
I cannot condone an act of sacrilege with my presence.
What's the matter, man?
For heaven's sakes, what is it?
He...
He went for a little walk!
You should have seen his face!
Here's something to break the monotony. A visitor coming from the Nile.
- Colour?
Nationality?
- How could I see in that glare?
Well, Whemple, back we go to London.
And what fools we look.
Money wasted. Hole after hole dug in this blasted desert.
A few beads. A few broken pots.
A man needs more than hard work for this game.
He needs flair. He needs luck.
Like your father.
When he came here, there wasn't so much competition.
When he did, he found things. And once, ten years ago, he found too much.
Was it ten years?
Queer story, that young Oxford chap he had with him going mad.
- You know what I think it was?
- No. What?
He went crazy. Bored beyond human endurance in this sand and these rocks.
He was laughing when your father found him. He died laughing, in a straitjacket.
Your father never explained.
But when the best excavator England has turned out, a man who loved Egypt, said he'd never come back here, that meant something.
Come in.
You break your season's camp, Professor Pearson?
Your colleagues have returned to London?
Yes. Whemple and I stayed behind to clear up.
Your expedition has not been a success.
Scarcely. Here are the season's finds.
Permit me to present you with the most sensational find since that of Tutankhamen.
This is very sporting of you!
May I ask why?
We Egyptians are not permitted to dig up our ancient dead.
Only... foreign museums.
What's this?
Part of the funerary equipment of the princess Anck-es-en-Amon.
- Daughter of Amenophis the Magnificent.
- Yes. It's her name.
I found that not 100 yards from where we are.
- You mean you think her tomb is there?
- I will show you where to dig.
I'm sure it's very good of you, Mr...?
I didn't catch your name.
Ardath Bey.
Circumstantial evidence. Not very strong, perhaps.
But if we put that gang of diggers from Kerma on the job, we can tell in two days if there's anything here.
In one day, Professor.
- It's a step.
- He was right.
Anyhow, we've found something.
- The name of Anck-es-en-Amon.
- We will cable your father in London.
He must be here when we examine this great find.
The seal of the seven jackals.
And it's unbroken.
No one has entered this door since the priests of the royal acropolis sealed it.
3700 years ago.
Is there a view like this in all the world, Helen?
The real Egypt.
Are we really in this dreadful modern Cairo?
Your thoughts are far from the dance and these nice English boys.
Not really. I'm having a lovely time.
- I'm so grateful.
- But why?
Your keeping me here with you, of course.
So I don't have to go up to Father in that beastly hot Sudan.
It's I who am grateful. My most interesting patient.
Know who that is?
- Muller of Vienna.
- Really?
Always spends his winters here. Authority on Egyptian occult.
- Yes, but the girl?
- Helen Grosvenor.
Her father's governor of the Sudan. English, of course. Her mother, Egyptian.
Some old family with a tree a mile long. She's staying here with Dr and Mrs Muller.
Pardon me, sir. Our closing bell has rung.
I did not notice the time.
- I am addressing Sir Joseph Whemple?
- Yes.
- I am Ardath Bey.
- Indeed!
Why, we have you to thank that we have this exhibit here at all.
The museum should be kept open all night in your honour.
Won't you come down to my office?
I'm working here late.
Your pardon. I dislike to be touched.
An Eastern prejudice.
Won't you sit down?
You know my son?
Ardath Bey.
Where did you disappear to when we opened the tomb?
I returned to Cairo.
But... but now I must not detain you.
But I must see you again. You must come to my house.
I regret I am too occupied to accept invitations.
He's a strange one.
You might have thanked him. He was responsible for finding the princess.
Yes. I rather wish he hadn't been.
It's a dirty trick, Cairo Museum keeping what we've found.
That was the contract. The British Museum works for science, not for loot.
Anck-es-en-Amon.
Anck-es-en-Amon.
Anck-es-en-Amon.
Is anything the matter?
Anck-es-en-Amon.
Anck-es-en-Amon.
Where do you want to go, miss?
Le musée des Antiquités.
Le musée des Antiquités.
Imhotep.
Anck-es-en-Amon.
Anck-es-en-Amon.
Imhotep.
Imhotep.
I must get in.
Anck-es-en-Amon.
- I must!
- It's closed for the night. They've gone.
I must get in.
Imhotep.
Imhotep.
Imhotep.
What's she saying?
What language is that?
The language of ancient Egypt. Not heard on this earth for 2000 years.
And the name of a man unspoken since before the siege of Troy.
- Is your master at home?
- Yes, sir.
Tell him Dr Muller wishes to see him urgently.
- How did I get here?
- We brought you here. Father and I.
You fainted.
But how did you guess she was here?
I discovered that she took a taxi from the hotel to the museum.
I went there.
The watchman said she had left in your car.
Before you take her away, I must talk to you about something she said just now.
- Oh, Dr Muller.
- Oh, here you are, my dear.
I suppose you introduced yourself?
No?
Miss Helen Grosvenor, my old friend Sir Joseph Whemple, Frank Whemple.
That seems so formal under these peculiar circumstances.
And now, if you're all right again, back we go to the hotel.
I think she'll want to rest a few minutes.
Frank, will you make yourself agreeable?
Well...
Where was I when I fainted, Mr Whemple?
- Oh, outside the museum.
- What was I doing there?
Well, I wouldn't know that, would I?
No, I don't suppose you would. I wish I did.
- I was waiting...
- Let's not talk about it.
Oh, right.
- You're partly Egyptian, aren't you?
- Yes.
How did you guess that?
Well, I don't know. Just something about you.
I'd have liked Egypt better if I'd met you there.
No such luck!
Stuck in the desert for two months, and was it hot!
- That tomb.
- What tomb?
Surely you read about the princess?
- So you did that?
- Yes.
The 14 steps down and the unbroken seals were thrilling.
But when we came to handle all her clothes, her jewels and her toilet things...
They buried everything with them they used in life.
- When we came to unwrap the girl...
- How could you do that?
Had to! Science, you know!
Well, after we'd worked among her things, I felt as if I'd known her.
But when we got the wrappings off, and I saw her face...
You'll think me silly, but I sort of fell in love with her.
Do you have to open graves to find girls to fall in love with?
I say. Now I know what it is about you.
There was something about her head...
I had never mentioned the name, yet I heard Miss Grosvenor mutter in ancient Egyptian something about Imhotep.
Imhotep?
What was this Ardath doing in the museum?
Looking at the mummy. Just at closing time.
Hello?
What?
Il est mort?
Tout de suite, effendi.
Come. A museum guard found dead in the room with the princess.
Fear.
Fear.
So he died of shock.
We find this in dead guard's hand, Sir Joseph.
Probably thief tried to steal it. Guard take it away, thief kill him.
The cause of death, I not find nothing.
Looks like an attempted theft, but nothing stolen here could be sold.
What is the document?
Let me put this here. You'll be more comfortable.
Thanks.
You really want to know why I didn't take you to the hospital?
- Because, when I held you in my arms...
- Hadn't you better not commit yourself?
What girl could not make a conquest who collapsed at a man's feet in moonlight?
It seems absurd when we've known each other such a short time, but I'm serious.
Haven't I had enough excitement for one evening, without the additional thrill of a strange man making love to me?
But I've never been serious about this sort of thing before.
Now, look here. You can tell me to go to the devil, but you can't laugh at me.
The curse has struck her, and now, through her, it will strike my son.
Quiet.
Frank, will you come to your father's study?
Helen, I shall take you home presently.
I'll be back in a minute.
Imhotep was alive when that mummy in the museum was a vestal virgin in the temple.
3700 years ago!
What's that got to do with us now?
Your assistant who went insane and died, as you might have if you'd seen what he saw, made a transcription of part of that scroll.
Yes. I have it still.
You seem to think it has all the devils of hell in it. Burn it and be done with it.
An excellent suggestion.
What became of the mummy of Imhotep?
Somebody stole it!
Look, what's the matter with Miss Grosvenor? You still think that that mummy was stolen, Sir Joseph? Yes.
I...
I really don't know.
A thousand pardons.
I am Ardath Bey.
I am Helen Grosvenor.
I called to see Sir Joseph.
- He's in the study.
- In conference?
If I might perhaps wait?
Yes.
Of course.
Have we not met before, Miss Grosvenor?
No.
I don't think so.
I don't think one would forget meeting you, Ardath Bey.
Then I am mistaken.
But you are of our blood.
As to that, I am not mistaken.
Yes. My mother was Egyptian.
You must burn the Scroll of Thoth!
I tell you, it's the museum's property, not mine.
Who's out there with Miss Grosvenor?
Ardath Bey!
He's come for the scroll.
Ardath Bey, Dr Muller.
I accept your invitation. But I find no solitary student with his books.
I fear my visit is inopportune.
On the contrary. We were just talking about...
- Me?
- Your native Egypt.
You know Miss Grosvenor?
Ardath Bey introduced himself.
Won't you be seated?
Sir Joseph was just wondering how you knew where the tomb of the princess Anck-es-en-Amon was hidden.
Partly inference, partly chance.
Sir Joseph, you seem disturbed.
Yes. A tragedy at the museum after you left.
Tragedy?
When I was there...
When you were there, Miss Grosvenor?
Yes. They told me I went there and tried to get in after it was closed.
I don't remember, but...
Helen, it is very late.
Frank, will you please see Helen back to the hotel?
- Certainly, if Miss Grosvenor will let me.
- I don't want to go.
After what happened, you need rest badly.
But I don't.
I was tired, but...
Why, I've never felt so alive before!
- As your doctor, I must order you to go.
- I'm not a child.
Yes, please come.
Then, Ardath Bey, au revoir.
We must see each other again.
I shall be honoured.
An unusual crime. A guard killed by a man who left a gift to the museum.
- A gift?
- A scroll.
Part of which was transcribed when it was first found.
Here is the transcription.
I cannot read the writing of a period so remote.
But you read "Anck-es-en-Amon" on that piece of pottery.
That was of the 18th dynasty.
These are pre-dynastic ideographs.
The scroll from which this was copied was stolen ten years ago, together with the mummy of the high priest Imhotep.
Most interesting.
May I see that scroll, Sir Joseph?
We left it at the... museum.
- So.
- I have something else to show you.
A photograph.
Why do you show all this to me?
Do you think it conceivable that the mummy was not stolen, but given a semblance of life by the spell of the scroll?
That scroll is my property. I bought it from a dealer.
It is here in this house. I presume, in that room.
We had foreseen this.
The scroll is in safe hands.
It will be destroyed the minute it is known that harm has come to us.
You have studied our ancient arts, and you know that you cannot harm me.
You also know that you must return that scroll to me or die.
Now tell that weak fool to get that scroll, wherever it is, and hand it to his Nubian servant.
- The Nubian!
- The ancient blood.
So you have made him your slave.
If I could get my hands on you, I'd break your dried flesh to pieces.
But your power is too strong.
This is the evil force that has been attacking her.
Burn the scroll, man.
Burn it!
It was through you this horror came into existence.
It's true.
It's true.
Your father destroyed the scroll, knowing that it would cost him his life.
What's that?
Isis.
The Egyptian symbol of life. I meant it for your father.
What good could that old charm have done him?
I tell you, the doctors say it's plainly heart failure.
The Nubian is missing.
He's an old servant.
He's frightened.
He'll be back.
Don't try and make me believe that this Ardath fellow is a mummy come to life.
That idea, and the horror of it, killed my father.
The museum guard died of natural causes, too.
Frank, I need your help.
I saw your attraction to my patient last night, and hers to you.
- Hers to me?
Do you really think so?
- And I welcomed it.
But do you think I have a chance?
Cos I think she's the most won...
- Oh, but this is terrible at a time like this...
- Frank, I'm afraid.
- Will you go with me to her now?
- Yes.
Then telephone her first, not to leave the hotel.
9590.
No.
I'm not going out.
Yes.
I promise to wait until you get here.
Goodbye.
And I'm so dreadfully sorry.
What were you doing, Doctor?
Your father did not burn the Scroll of Thoth.
That creature has it now.
- The ashes in the fireplace!
- They were newspaper.
The scroll is papyrus.
Then it was murder?
The Nubian!
Wear this around your neck.
- Why?
- When we fight this creature, we must ask protection from the forces of all that it defied.
- I'll give it to Helen.
She needs protection.
- No, her life is not in danger.
It is her soul.
Should love for you come to her, he will try to destroy you.
That amulet, the Egyptians believed, was a charm against evil sendings, such as struck down your father.
Your dog is frightened.
My servant will see to him.
Sit down, Miss Grosvenor.
Ancient Egypt.
Nothing modern.
What a strange incense.
Is it not familiar to you?
- No.
- Our forefathers used it.
Yours and mine.
You will not remember what I show you now, and yet I shall awaken memories of love and crime and death.
I knelt by the bed of death.
Thy father's last farewell.
I knew the Scroll of Thoth could bring thee back to life.
I dared the god's anger, and stole it.
I stole back to thy tomb to bring thee back to life.
I murmured the spell that raises the dead.
They broke in upon me and found me doing an unholy thing.
Thy father condemned me to the nameless death.
The scroll he ordered buried with me, that no such sacrilege might disgrace Egypt again.
A nameless grave.
The slaves were killed so that none should know.
The soldiers who killed them were also slain, so no friend could creep to the desert with funeral offerings for my condemned spirit.
Anck-es-en-Amon.
My love has lasted longer than the temples of our gods.
No man ever suffered as I did for you.
The rest you may not know.
Not until you are about to pass through the great night of terror and triumph, until you are ready to face moments of horror for an eternity of love,
until I send back your spirit, that has wandered through so many forms and so many ages.
But, before then, Bast must again send forth death.
Death to that boy for whom love is creeping into your heart.
Love that would keep you from myself.
Love that might bring sickness and even death to you.
Awake.
Have I been asleep?
I had strange dreams.
Dreams of ancient Egypt, I think.
There was someone like you in them.
My pool is sometimes troubled.
One sees strange fantasies in the water. But they pass like dreams.
My dog!
Wolfram!
Wolfram!
Where is he?
Helen.
Helen!
Where have you been?
We've been so worried. We've hunted everywhere.
- In the museum again?
- Yes.
Muller's down in the Arab quarter now.
Well, if I must give an explanation, it was stuffy in here.
I can't be shut up all the time. And I don't like the feeling I'm always being watched.
- I took the dog with me.
- Where is the dog?
He's dead.
- But how?
- I don't know.
- Well, where?
- I don't remember.
But I can see it now.
Standing on poor Wolfram's back.
- A white cat.
- A white cat?
The cat-goddess Bast!
Yes, there was a statue of Bast.
The goddess of evil sendings!
Just what happened?
Try to remember, Helen!
I don't want to remember.
Besides, I don't see it's any affair of yours.
Oh, but it is.
We know that you were with Ardath Bey.
Oh, Helen.
Helen, I love you.
I'm trying to help you and protect you.
We all are.
Don't let me go again. I'll try to get away, but you mustn't let me.
No matter what I do or what I say.
There's death there for me.
And life for something else inside me that isn't me.
But it's alive too, and fighting for life.
Save me from it, Frank.
Save me.
Oh, everything's going to be all right.
Now that you've asked for help, I'll never leave you alone.
I'll get Mrs Muller down here with you, and I'll stay here till the doctor comes.
Then, we'll take you to my house.
Oh, Helen.
It's been such torture.
I love you so.
I don't like that doctor. Please go in there and find out what he's saying about me.
I will, my dear.
He'll know just what's the matter with you and cure you.
Now, don't worry.
Now, Miss Farthing, help me to get dressed and get out of here.
- Come over you again, Miss Grosvenor?
- I must escape.
I'm being held.
Help me.
You told me, when these fits came on I wasn't to listen.
I have a friend. He's rich. He'll give you money.
Now you just lie down again. You know you mustn't get up.
If you don't want money, what do you want most?
He'll give you anything, if only you'll help me to go to him.
Do you want me to call Dr Muller?
- No.
I hate him.
- Mr Whemple, then?
I'll die if I don't get away from him!
- Now, Miss Grosvenor.
- It's killing me!
Now, Helen, you must not do this again.
You're always so exhausted afterwards.
She's too weak to be removed except to a hospital.
I insist on keeping her here under our direct observation.
But, Doctor, you haven't told us what to do. She gets weaker every day.
You know that negligée I bought in Paris? Help me to put it on.
And bring me my toilet things. I want some colour. I want to look well.
You can't, my dear.
They'd never allow it.
- The nurse would be sure...
- I know.
We'll get rid of her.
This is a plot, just between us. I want to look the way I did.
Just a surprise, for Frank.
And I want you to bring him to me. You understand?
In short, I have failed to make a diagnosis.
Medical science is helpless in a case like this.
Frank.
Go to her, and don't be angry with me. I couldn't resist her.
Helen, you shouldn't have done this. They shouldn't have let you.
Just this once.
Perhaps the last time.
But you're going to get well.
Then I know I can make you love me.
I know I can make you happy.
I do love you, Frank.
And I'm trying to prove it, because I'd rather die than live and lose you.
But you're going to live. We're not going to lose each other.
- So, my dear. You...
- Don't scold me.
Just feminine vanity. I wanted to look my best again.
So you know more than I realised you knew.
- What do you mean?
- These impulses to go to him.
The pull is too strong to withstand and live.
I am so glad you understand.
Helen knows.
She knows the moment she stops struggling, he will give her back her strength to come to him.
But I don't want to lose my own mind and be someone else. Someone I hate.
My dear, while you were growing worse, we tried to find him and failed.
The next time the call comes, go to him.
Muller, what can we do now?
We can do no more. Ardath has beaten me.
The next time he draws her to him, we must follow her.
- And then?
- We will destroy him.
I've given her some bromide. She's asleep now. I'll go to bed.
- All right.
I'll wait till Dr Muller comes.
- Good night.
Good night.
Where are we?
This is my bed, but this is not the temple, nor my father's palace.
Do not look, Anck-es-en-Amon.
Do not be afraid.
I was afraid. When you knelt beside my bed, a veil came over my eyes. Darkness.
Your last memory is of me in the hour of your death as I knelt by your bed, 3700 years ago.
No man has ever suffered for woman as you suffered for me.
- Now that the gods have forgiven us...
- No, no, not yet.
Your soul is in a mortal body, renewed many times since we loved in Thebes of old.
But that love is not for us again until the great change.
I do not understand.
Look.
- Look and wonder.
- A figure of myself.
It is my coffin, made by my father against my death.
What mummy has usurped my eternal resting place?
It is thy dead shell. I tried then to raise this body.
I could raise it now, but it would be a mere thing that moved at my will, without a soul.
It was not only this body that I loved, it was thy soul.
I destroy this lifeless thing.
Thou shalt take its place but for a few moments, and then rise again, even as I have risen.
Come.
Imhotep, this is the place of embalming.
It is not lawful for me, a priestess of Isis, to see or touch an unclean thing.
Come to the altar of Anubis, the guide of the dead.
The time has come for the final prayer.
What have I to do with Anubis?
The ancient rites must be performed over thy body.
Then I will read the great spell with which
Isis brought Osiris back from the grave.
And thou shalt rise again.
No.
No, I'm alive!
I'm young!
I won't die!
I loved you once, but now you belong with the dead.
I am Anck-es-en-Amon, but I...
I'm somebody else too.
I want to live, even in a strange new world.
For thy sake I was buried alive.
I ask of thee only a moment of agony. Only so can we be united.
The bath of natron.
You shall not plunge my body into that.
Let the deed be done.
Let me go.
Let me go!
Don't kill me!
I'm a priestess of Isis.
Save me from that mummy!
It's dead!
Save me!
I no longer fear you. Do with me what you will.
Frank.
Frank!
She has gone to him. They must be in the museum.
Now I know his horrible plan.
He is going to kill her, and make her a living mummy like himself.
The gods will receive into the underworld the spirit of Anck-es-en-Amon.
But not for long.
Osiris will release thy soul.
You shall rest from life, like the setting sun in the west.
But you shall dawn anew in the east, as the first rays of Amon-Ra dispel the shadow.
Look!
What's that?
Come on.
Anck-es-en-Amon.
Frank!
Frank!
Helen!
Helen!
Helen.
O Isis, holy maiden. I was thy consecrated vestal.
I broke my vows. Save me now!
Teach me the ancient summons, the holy spells I've forgotten.
I call upon thee as of old!
Helen!
Call her.
He has dragged her back to ancient Egypt.
Call her!
Her love for you may bridge the centuries.
Helen.
Helen!
Come back.
It's Frank.
Come back.

Thief!
Why do you insist I stole something?
It is our customer's handbag. Give it back!
Search anywhere!
If we find it, you'll be knocked out!
You've chased me all this way.
You'll regret it!
See? Where is it?
Remember this, you cucumber!
Today we have work at the harbor.
Don't do little trifle jobs.
Hollywood queen Tamae Kiyokawa returns today.
Do you have any special reason for your return?
I've come home to see my child.
Do you have a child?
Six years ago when I left Japan, I left my baby behind.
What is the name of the child?
Where is it?
I cannot tell you.
Tamae's salary is 4,000 dollars a week.
And now she has a fortune of 500 or 600,000.
Her money is just one concern for me. I have others too.
If you did something with her when she was in Japan...
No, you're too young for it.
Sister!
I knew you were my sister, but you have a different name.
Thief!
I found this dropped here.
The angel Tamae had left in Japan...
Mother, I'll bring your dishes now.
Father!
How is the trouble at the company?
Is Mother in the house?
I will fetch her.
Be a good girl, Shigeko, go and play for a while.
I think you could guess it already from before, but now you have to prepare.
Then, are you bankrupt?
I did everything possible, but in this recession, I couldn't recover.
From the start, I was against you becoming president of that fishing company.
It was obvious from the start.
It was your fault, you thought you could do it alone.
It's none of your business.
Frankly, I don't want to be poor.
Mother has lived without knowing any hardships, it's natural she can't give it up.
Let's go walk around, I have time today.
I don't mind being poor, but I'd like her to grow up without any sacrifices.
She is happy, she has a good mother like you.
Even though you're in trouble, please don't do anything illegal.
Pull yourself together! Masako! Masako!
When did Mr. Atsumi marry his wife?
It was soon after you left.
Then the child thought she was her real mother, and became attached to her.
In six years...
That's understandable...
It might be wise if you gave her up.
I didn't come back from the US to give her up.
Sister, is this Atsumi's company?
According to this, that company's going broke.
You got injured by being careless.
I'm sorry.
Please go to bed now.
You'd better sleep too.
Is Shigeko asleep already?
Yes.
Why don't you sleep?
I can't sleep.
My mother was hit for me, I couldn't sleep.
Thank you, Shigeko.
I will be cured with those words.
Please get well soon.
I will, I will.
So please go to bed quietly.
We are not asking for your explanation.
We are asking about our unpaid salary.
I will not disappoint you.
Please wait for a few days.
I've got an offer from someone, so my secretary Ochiai is there.
Then we will wait for your answer til 3 pm tomorrow.
How about it?
It's fine!
I met a young agent, who said he'll see you today and make an offer.
Shunsaku Atsumi
Please let him in...
I am very glad to see you looking well.
Is it you who offered me the money?
I think it's because we have a chance.
We separated six years ago!
Have you forgotten what you did?
Who is the woman who abandoned her husband and child, and ran off?
I came here because I could not forget.
I'd like to pay you for my past sin.
I refuse!
Please, please forgive my sin and let me be Shigeko's mother again.
Shigeko has a respectable mother!
I refuse your offer to be her mother!
I can find a good house.
How did it go?
I will not lose!
I will not lose this way!
Bankruptcy!
I've lived this long, and now I'm ashamed...
I'd rather die than bear it.
And now I have to move to a small house.
I've lost face.
Where can I go?
Please leave just that doll...
How about you?
I'll be up in a few days.
I have to go now, I have business to take care of, please rest well.
Where are you going?
Don't worry.
Detective: San'nosuke Yamano
Please come to the police station.
Please keep the house while I am away.
Father, where are you going?
Please buy me a souvenir.
Be sure to wait, be a good girl.
Mother, why are you crying?
I am not crying.
See, I am smiling.
Why did they take the furniture?
Shigeko, let's be friends.
It's two hours since he left.
Is he all right?
I think he won't fail.
I gave him careful instructions.
Who are you?
Why did you bring me to such a fine house?
Don't worry. You will soon understand.
I missed you, mother!
Did you forget me?
I am Kinuko.
I understand I failed in my social duties, but, please forgive my past and...
You have become rich...
I think I am dreaming.
I have heard of your situation.
I guess you are worrying so much.
I think I can be of help.
That's why I brought you here.
Is it possible to let me be Shigeko's mother again?
Mother!
Here comes Uncle Kusakabe.
When did you come back from Manchuria?
This morning.
I visited your old house as soon as possible, but I had trouble finding you here.
It seems you've got thinner this time.
I am sorry I could not help you...
I was not in the country.
By the way, what will you do?
I found a job.
I start working tomorrow.
There comes an interesting picture-show at that corner. You can go there.
What is your name?
Shigeko Atsumi.
Why don't you come to my house riding in this car?
If you come with me, I can introduce you to your real mother.
Liar!
Kidnapper!
Fool!
There's a kidnapping woman at that corner.
Next day...
"To Masako From Mother"
"I am taking Shigeko to a certain place.
Don't worry." "I will hasten to inform you further.
- Mother"
I know where they have gone.
I hear Atsumi's former wife, that is, Shigeko's real mother, has come back to Japan.
I guess they went there, but I do not know where she is.
If it is true, must I give her up?
You don't need to give her up.
Only you are Shigeko's mother.
I'm sure to find her.
Leave it all to me and wait.
This is the wife of my good friend since early school days.
Bring her something.
I don't want a doll. I want to go back to my mother.
This is not your own bar. Be quiet!
Don't you know me?
That's not your sake, you show-off.
I know you are strong.
Then, fight.
I'll have a word with you.
Brother! That's him.
I know you know!
Where is Atsumi's child?
If you don't know where the child is, tell me where your sister is.
Quiet!
It's not your business!
I'd like to go back to my mother's.
Let's play with some interesting things.
They will show you a battle between a lion and leopard.
Please take me home, grandma.
Your home is here.
Be a good girl, play with this mother here.
I like that mother.
Please go back to that mother's home.
I think you have no chance to win.
It's your fault!
You talked about Kusakabe in front of her, that reminded her.
There's a woman here named Masako Atsumi.
That's my mother!
Please let her come in.
How do you do. I am Masako, Shigeko's mother.
I came here to bring her back.
Why do you, not related to her, think of taking charge of her?
Shigeko is my child.
Even if I hadn't seen her in ten years, or even forever, she is still my child.
Didn't you decide to cut the connection between mother and child?
Can you insist she is your child when she was never at your breast?
Mother!
I think badly of you.
Be a good girl, please stay in that room with your grandmother.
Push her out!
Failed?
I think you'd better go back tonight.
I came here today to apologize.
Mother and Shigeko were taken by your former wife.
I went to bring her back, but I was kicked out after only seeing her face.
Day after day, Mr. Kusakabe is carrying on negotiations, but she won't even meet with him.
If she does not come back to me...
what should I...
Forgive me!
It is all my fault.
It's my fault.
I was careless.
At last, she's asleep.
Why doesn't she take to me easily?
Even though we've long been separated, I never forgot her.
But she dislikes me, she even refuses to sit by me.
The bond between mother and child is so fragile?
You don't need to worry so much she will come around sooner or later.
Mother!
I can't find Shigeko anywhere!
Please go away, Auntie.
Grandma, I'd like to see my mother.
Please bring her here.
Your mother is here. Please be a good girl.
That is not my mother.
I'd like to see my mother's face.
Is she gone today too?
I brought some food with me today.
I will wait here until she returns.
Madame will see you.
Please come in.
Well? Did the child get attached to you?
I think she's not lacking filial devotion to her mother...
I believe I am going the right way.
I won't be under your care.
You are the winner.
You have taken her.
I admire you on that point.
But, I guess you feel disappointed at your victory.
If she liked you better than nothing, I would ask Masako to give her up instead.
But I think it's not bearing a child but raising one that makes a woman a mother.
The doctor has some words for your daughter.
Is she ill?
No!
You go back!
I won't insist on taking a sick child.
I would only like to see her face.
If she met you, she would want to go back!
Mr. Kusakabe, please think of me also!
I hear Shigeko is ill.
Is she bad?
That night...
Auntie, don't sit by me!
Go away!
I am sorry.
I'd like to stay here only while you are asleep.
Be a good girl, don't say such things.
Please call her mother, even just once.
If I call her that, could you take me to my mother?
No, Shigeko.
I will wait until you call me that from your heart.
Grandma, why do you keep me in this house?
I'm starting to dislike you, Grandma.
I can't imagine you like that mother so much.
That's because that mother is a very good mother.
Mother!
I will let you meet your mother secretly.
Please stay here.
Please let me see Shigeko, just for a moment.
I wouldn't leave you even if I died.
I will...
I will...
Forgive me.
I'm the one who let them meet secretly.
I feel pitiful, Shigeko loves Masako so much.
Anyway, please go back tonight.
No!
If she goes, I will go, too!
"I think it's not bearing a child but raising one that makes a woman a mother."
And...
Today I bring you some good news.
First, Tamae has decided to give all her fortune to Shigeko.
She's decided to let Shigeko stay with you.
At this point, I feel sorry for her.
And there's other news, that is more pleasant.
The good news is...
I can't believe Shigeko came too.
It's because Tamae... no, Kinuko came to know the real love of a mother.
Anyway, we will visit Kinuko soon.
I will tell you the details on the way.
The car is waiting for us.
But on that day, Tamae is...
Brother, I didn't imagine even in a dream that we could go to America.
What are you doing?
We've been looking for you.
I cannot see her anymore...
Now listen, men.
Spring is here... and spring is a dangerous time of the year, especially in Paris.
The wanderlust is in the air.
Travelers are coming here from everywhere - from Cincinnati and Singapore.
- Now, what do they come for?
- We know.
That's right. Chicago packers don't come here for a plate of cold cuts.
Big planters don't come from Brazil just for nuts.
From Norway and Sweden, they don't come here to fish.
But whether they come from Amsterdam or Birmingham or Siam... we let them do whatever they wish.
We let them play in any way... as long as they're willing to pay.
That's okay.
But spring is here.
And after dark, our cafés are empty.
But every park has standing room only every night.
- Now that's wrong. - That's right.
The situation is not funny.
Our best cafés are losing money.
We must clean up the public parks.
We must clean up the public parks.
Cleaner parks and more prosperity.
Cleaner parks. Cleaner parks. More prosperity.
Come on. Come on. Where do you think you are?
What are you doing?
What's going on here?
The French Revolution.
Hey! You can't make love in public.
- I can make love anywhere. - No, you can't.
- Oh, but, Officer, he can. - Darling!
Get up.
- What's your name? - Dr. Bertier.
And your name?
Madame Bertier.
- So you're married, eh?
- Yes, Officer.
And you expect me to believe that?
- Oh, please. - Please.
Now let me tell you something.
You're the only married couple in this park.
Get out!
Well, there's only one other place to go.
Why not?
Listen, Officer. Do you see that moon?
If he could talk French, do you know what he would say to you?
Phooey.
Ladies and gentlemen, I must talk to you.
This is a very delicate situation.
There is Colette, and here am I.
And I know what you think. Oh! I know.
How dare you.
You remember that policeman?
He was wrong. And so are you.
Believe it or not, we are married.
I am her husband.
And she is my wife.
And I can prove it to you.
Oh, look. This is a picture of our wedding.
Myself and the bridesmaids.
And this is my wife.
Before the wedding, naturally.
And look at this lady.
My mother-in-law.
A marvelous cook.
In other words, I am married, and I like it.
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
Now, gentlemen, as a doctor... let me ask you a personal question.
How long since you have been in a park?
I mean - I mean, with your wife.
Ah. Ladies, that's what's wrong.
Build up your park life to ensure your home life.
Darling.
That's for me. Sweetheart.
That's for her. I'll be with you in a minute.
That's for both of us.
Vive la France.

Oh, darllng, I forgot to tell you.
Tell me, sweetheart. Tell me.
You know who's coming tomorrow for lunch?
Sweetheart, tomorrow morning... when the sun is shining and the breakfast is on the table... and the little birdies are singing in the trees...
I want you to tell me all about it.
But not now!
But, darling, you don't even know who it is.
It's Mitzi. My old school chum Mitzi.
- Not Mitzi!
- Yes, Mitzi!
Oh. Mitzi!
Andre, what have you against Mitzi?
- You don't even know her. - No.
- I want you to meet her. - Yes.
- I know you'll like her. - Mm-hmm.
She's the very best friend I had until she moved to Lausanne.
- Mm-hmm. - And now she's come back.
Mitzi, Kitzi, Fitzi, Bitzi.
So that's Mitzi.
That's she.
My wife.
When I married her, she was a brunette.
Now you can't believe a word she says.
That's all very well, Professor, but have you any proof?
As a prospective client to a detective, let me ask you a question.
Would you call me handsome?
Well, as a detective to a prospective client, uh, no.
- Have a cigar. - Thanks.
Now let me ask you another question.
As one man to another, would you call this a beautiful woman?
Oh, sweetheart.
- She's lying again. - Lie back.
- Yes, angel?
- Good morning.
Good morning.
Are you busy?
No. Not at all.
Well, uh, I don't want to disturb you.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
In Switzerland we have a very peculiar law.
When a husband shoots his wife, they put him in jail.
- Is this taxi engaged?
- Yes, madame.
Oh, that's too bad.
But, madame -
- Really, I - I hate to do this, monsieur. - It's perfectly all right, madame.
But perhaps both of us - Perhaps I could drop you, if you -
- I'm going towards the Bois. - So am I.
- Oh. That's fine. - Oh, that's splendid.
- Professor- - Yes.
Speaking "detectively," you're as good as divorced right now.
Do you think the Five-Year Plan will go over?
Madame, I don't believe in making plans.
Neither do I, monsieur.
I leave everything to the moment.
It's a very good place to live in.
You know, I think it was awfully sweet of you to take me along.
I think so too.
Oh, monsieur, you're conceited.
No, madame. I am married.
So, you have a wife.
Mm-hmm. And she has a husband.
Mmm. I can imagine.
- Madame. - Monsieur.
Tell me. Do you see anything wrong in us being alone together in this cab?
- Absolutely not. - Neither do I.
Two strange people of opposite sex, riding in a cab... sitting side by side.
The gentleman reading a newspaper.
The lady looking out of the window.
Explain that to your wife.
She won't believe it! Would you believe it?
- Never! - I wouldn't believe it myself.
No, and let me tell you something. My husband wouldn't believe it either.
Your-Y-Your-
Oh, m-madame, we're in a terrible situation.
Oh, we're as good as guilty. All the facts are against us.
What shall we do?
Throw your newspaper away and let us face the facts.
Madame.
Monsieur.
Driver, stop!
Madame, you may think I'm a coward.
I am!
- Mitzi! - Colette!
Darling!
You look marvelous!
Oh, Mitzi, my darling. How have you been?
I haven't seen you since that day in Lausanne.
I've so much to tell you I can hardly begin.
But weren't we happy and gay in Lausanne?
You look just as smart and as stunning as then.
Oh, I'm much wiser, though, thanks to several men.
Oh, how's the composer you went with so much?
He's gone, but he had such a wonderful touch.
And the painter who painted you all draped in gauze?
One night I found out what an artist he was.
Your boudoir's adorable, simply divine.
And that bed - It's too gorgeous. I wish it were mine.
My favorite perfume. Femme de Paris.
Yes. Andre's so generous. He gave it to me.
- Ah.
- Oh, I must show you my new lingerie.
Too stunning for only a husband to see.
- Those dresses - how thrilling!
- Yes, they're really quite fair.
I was just telling Andre how I've nothing to wear.
- Ah?
- Of course, these are his.
Oh, they're as cute as can be.
But where is the rest of them?
Oh, pardon me.
- Well - - Colette!
I buy all his things, and believe it or not, he wears even the ties.
- Well, he must love you a lot. - How's the professor?
- Which one do you mean?
- The one that you married.
- Oh, he's still on the scene. - You don't sound so happy.
Unless you're well mated, this business of marriage is much overrated.
Oh, Mitzi, you don't know how sorry I feel.
As for Andre and me - well, he's just too ideal.
He sets me atingle. I set him aflame.
♪ And no matter what happens ♪
♪ We still stay the same ♪
♪ Day after day ♪
♪ We will always be sweethearts the same ♪
♪ As the day we began ♪
♪ Do what he may ♪
♪ We will always be sweethearts ♪
♪ For he is my boy ♪
♪ And my man ♪
♪ He kisses me and my lips are so willing ♪
♪ But we both agree ♪
♪ That each time it's more thrilling ♪
♪ And so I can say ♪
♪ We will always be sweethearts the same ♪
♪ As the day ♪
♪ We began ♪♪
Darling.
This is Mitzi. And this is Andre.
I'm - I'm extremely happy, madame.
Doctor, the pleasure's mine.
My very best friend and... my very, very husband.
Don't you like her?
Oh, y-yes. Oh, yes. I
Look at him. Look at him.
Oh. No.
Isn't he darling?
I think he's cute.
Oh, please.
Oh!
You mean to tell me -
- He can?
- Yes, he can.
- No! - I tell you he can!
Let's see him do it.
Darling, look like an owl.
- Oh, no. - Oh, please, darling.
Please.
- No, no. - Oh, please do, Dede.
- Oh, no, no.
- Oh, please, Doctor. Look like an owl.
- Oh, now, madame. Will you - No.
- I can't do it
- No, no, no.
- Please.
Please, Doctor.
Madame, luncheon is served.
It's about time.
- After lunch you'll do it?
- You will do it for me?
- No, no. Really, I - - Mitzi, I hope you have a good appetite.
- Do you play Ping-Pong?
- Oh. Now, now stop it.
My wife thinks I am a darling.
And my wife's friend thinks I'm cute.
It's a terrible situation.
But I am determined not to weaken.
We'll see.
Oh, madame.
Oh, call Élysées 0546. Tell Dr. Bertier to come.
- Yes, madame. At once. - Describe my condition.
- Tell him you fear the worst. - Oh, madame!
Madame, what happened?
Please tell me. Tell me.
Come on. Do as I tell you. Élysées 0546.
Tell Dr. Bertier to come. Now hurry up. Hurry up.
Oh!
Élysées 0546.
Hello. Yes?
Yes?
What?
What?
She's sick?
Oh. Oh, yes.
Mitzi's sick.
Tell her I'm too tired.
Uh, what?
Well, yes. Yes. Naturally.
She wants the doctor right away.
Can't she make it tomorrow?
Just a minute, please.
Andre, this is no time for joking.
But why should I go?
Let her get another doctor.
Let her get two other doctors. I don't want to mix business with Mitzi.
He doesn't want to mix business with you.
- Why can't you be nice to my friends?
- But this is business. This is different.
- You hate her. - Oh, darling, don't be ridiculous.
- I have nothing against her. - I know you hate her.
- But why should I hate her? - Well, you certainly don't like her.
I'm crazy about her!
- Then why don't you want to go?
- Because I don't want to mix "musiness" with Bitzi.
Business with Mitzi. Oh, Mitzi, Kitzi, Bitzi.
All right. I'll go.
Yes, Madame Bertier. Yes. Thank you.
Oh!
Good-bye, sweetheart.
Good-bye, darling.
And remember.
No matter what she has - heart trouble, appendicitis... rheumatism, neuritis -
I love you.
Oh!
Madame, you sent for me.
I want it to be clearly understood that you're sick.
Oh, Doctor.
Not "Oh, Doctor."
Just "Doctor."

Hello.
This is Dr. Bertier.
My husband, Professor Olivier.
Dr. Bertier?
Dr. Bertier, physician.
Professor Olivier.
Ancient history.
- Doctor. - Professor.
Ah.
Ah, yes.
Ah.
Darling, I'm not feeling very well.
Why should you?
Oh, no, Professor. Madame is in a very serious condition.
Why-Why shouldn't she be?
Conditions are bad everywhere.
The professor is joking.
Oh, no. No, I have no sense of humor.
No sense of humor at all.
Now, children.
You are my wife's doctor.
My wife is your patient.
You are the husband of my wife's best friend.
And I am the husband of your wife's best friend.
I am looking forward to a very happy Christmas.
Now get out.
Hurry. Hurry. It's getting late.
Hello?
Just a moment. Madame Lacroix.
How do you do, Madame Lacroix?
Yes, Madame Lacroix.
No, Madame Lacroix. No.
No. Not next week. The party's tonight.
Yes. Yes, thank you. I'm fine.
Yes, thank you. He's fine. Good-b
Oh, you're fine too?
That's fine. Good-bye.
Yes?
Oh, Madame Rodevska.
Yes. Yes, I see.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm. How interesting.
What? You're wearing a red dress?
Very décolleté?
Practically no back?
No stockings at all? But you're coming?
That's fine.
Who is it?
Oh, Adolph.
No, Adolph. What do you want?
Oh, really, Adolph. It's 7:30.
I have a million things to do.
This is no time for silly conversation.
Hmm?
Hmm?
Colette, am I sitting next to you tonight?
Colette, tonight, next to you?
Now, Adolph, listen. You're Andre's closest friend.
You were best man at our wedding. That's as far as I'll go.
What?
Romeo?
You're coming as Romeo?
Yes. Yes, Romeo.
Of Romeo and Juliet.
What?
What?
Not a costume party.
Oh.
- Marcel. - Yes, sir?
Why did you tell me it was to be a costume party?
Ah, monsieur. I did so want to see you in tights.
Uh, I don't think that Martel girl is so attractive.
I do.
All right. All right. I
Everybody-Everybody is entitled to his own opinion.
That's what makes the world go round.
For instance - For instance, take Russia.
Darling, I swear I've been true to you.
Why did you change those place cards?
Sweetheart, you know I love you - and only you.
Why did you change those place cards?
If I tell you the truth, would you believe it?
No.
Darling, I'm going.
Good-bye, angel. Sorry I can't go with you.
Are you staying out late tonight, precious?
Yes, beloved. I don't think I'll be home before morning.
Aw, that's too bad.
Good-bye, sweetheart.
Good-bye, darling.
- What are you doing tonight?
- Nothing, madame.
- Wouldn't you like to go out?
- No, madame. I'm too tired.
Too tired?
For a little dance and a good time?
- Not really. - Yes, madame.
- You can have the night off. - I'm sorry, madame, but really I'm too tired.
Other girls are grateful for a day off, and you -you're too tired.
Oh, you're a most unreasonable girl and most ungrateful.
- Oh, but I -
- Oh, be quiet.
Mitzi, I suspect Andre.
Colette.
You know what I found out?
How should I know?
He didn't want to sit next to you tonight.
- And you know why?
- Why?
He wanted to sit next to Mademoiselle Martel.
Uh-huh.
What do you mean, "Uh-huh"?
- Have you heard anything?
- Now, Colette, darling.
I believe Andre is absolutely faithful.
I don't care what people say.
People say?
- So everybody knows. - Oh.
- Oh, tell me, Mitzi. Tell me everything. - Darling.
There's absolutely nothing to tell.
Nothing definite.
There she is.
Look at that dress.
Ah, madame.
Oh. Oh, my dear.
How are you?
I'm so glad to see you.
- You look perfectly stunning. - Do you really think so?
Oh, gorgeous. I'm simply crazy about that dress.
And you're looking so well too.
Hello, Andre.
Where is Colette?
- What's the matter?
- I want to say "How do you do?" to her.
Dinner is served.
Let's be happy. Let's be gay.
Come on. Let's drink and be merry.
Let's have a good time.
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes, Romeo.
Oh. Oh, Colette.
Colette, when are we going to dance?
Oh, when are we going to be gay?
When are we going to have all that fun?
Hmm?
Well, Colette, when are we going to have -
Right now.

Mitzi, please, don't.
Mitzi, don't be so Mitzi.
Why do you do that? I can't tie a tie.
I never could tie a tie.
But I can tie a tie... and how.
There you are.
Just a sample.
Mitzi!
Mitzi!
Mitzi, my tie!
Pardon me.
I'm a prisoner on my own veranda.
If I go inside, my wife sees me... and I get into trouble.
If I go to the garden to Mitzi, I get into trouble too.
But anyhow, I get my tie fixed.
What shall I do?
I go inside, my wife sees me, and I get into trouble.
I go to the garden to Mitzi, I get into trouble, too, but anyhow, I get my tie fixed.

I go inside, my wife sees me, I get into trouble.
I go to the garden to Mitzi -
I get my tie fixed.
A night in May.
Look at the moon.
Colette, how does the moon affect you?
It turns me inside out and upside down.
I tell you, if I didn't have such a splendid education, I'd -
I'd yield to the animal in me.
Yes, I - I admit I come of a very fine family.
Well, should a refined gentleman not have any luck?
Does one have to be a roughneck to get along in the world?
I wonder where Andre is.
I love you, Colette.
Colette, I love you.
Let's - Let's - Let's run away.
- You're still a young woman. - Andre!
My tie. My tie.
- Andre. - Andre!
Andre?
Andre?
Oh!
- We had a most delightful time, Doctor. - Thank you.
- Good night. - Good night, Andre.
- Good night. - Thank you.
Good night, Dr. Bertier. I had a perfectly charming evening.
- Thank you so much. - It was a pleasure, madame.
I'll be waiting in a taxi on the next corner for five minutes.
Impossible.
- Ten minutes. - Ridiculous.
All right. Fifteen minutes.
Positively maybe.
Good-bye, madame.
- Good night. - Good night.

Why don't you go back to Mademoiselle Martel?
- Oh, darling. - It may be a joke to you, but it -
Our romance is over.
Oh, darling.
If I wanted to start something with Mademoiselle Martel... would I do it here?
Couldrt I call her to my office?
So, that's what goes on in your office!
Darling, we have been married for three years.
And for three years, you've gone to your office every day.
Sweetheart, take my word - This Martel girl -
- I don't believe you! - I demand that you believe me.
I saw what I saw.
Let's not talk about it.
Let me take you in my arms. I love you.
You're lying!
Darling, if you don't believe me -
If you don't believe me, in two and a half minutes, I'm going out.
Oh. So you're threatening me, are you?
All right. Go out.
Darling, I warn you, I'm going.
I heard you. Go!
All right.
- I'm going. - My compliments to Mademoiselle Martel.

Oh.
Sorrow makes you look even more beautiful.
Thank you, Adolph.
More feminine... younger.
- Do you really think so?
- I do, Colette.
Oh, thank you, Adolph.
Any man who leaves a woman like you... on a night like this, with a man like me... deserves it.
But it was my fault. I was wrong.
You have a right to be wrong.
You're a woman. Women are born to be wrong.
I like my women wrong.
You poor, lonely little thing.
Oh, I'm so unappy.
- You need love. - Yes. Love.
Lots of love.
Lots of love.
Get out!
Get out, or I'll call my husband!
- Oh, darling. - My dear, how excited you seem.
I just had a dream, a terrible dream.
I dreamed that last night, when you were gone, I was downstairs alone and -
Yes, yes?
Go on.
Suddenly a man took hold of me. I - I struggled, and he -
- Choked you?
- No.
- Shot you?
- No.
What did he do?
He kissed me.
Oh. Kissed you.
Your dream shall come true.
But the man wasn't you.
Someone I know?
- He's your pal. - What a pal!
- It was Adolph. - Oh, no. Not Adolph.

Come in.
Darling, whatever-
- Professor!
- Doctor.
- Oh, it's nice of you to drop in. - Uh-huh.
We missed you a lot last night.
- Wort you sit down? - Thank you. Yes.
- Excuse me one minute. - Yes.
- Uh, it's a bit drafty, eh? - Yes.
Did you, uh, have a good time last night?
Well, we -we tried our best.
First we had, uh -we had dinner.
Then we danced.
And then we -we played a little.
Played?
May I ask what?
- Cards. - Cards?
Bridge.
You didn't play cards last night, Doctor.
Oh!
Professor.
I ought to know.
You were in my apartment last night.
- In your apartment?
- Mm-hmm.
Let me see.
You left your house... at 2:10.
You went to the corner, jumped into a cab.
My wife was in that cab.
Yes. Yes, that's true.
That's absolutely true.
Uh, your-your wife - your wife was alone.
See, naturally, as her host...
I wanted to see her get home safely.
Thank you for protecting my wife, Doctor.
- It was only my duty, Professor. - Yes.
Now, let me see
-The car arrived in front of my house at 2:35.
You and my wife stayed in the car... for eight minutes... up to 2:43.
Right. Right.
Your-Your wife just - just asked me something.
And then I answered.
Then another question, and then another answer.
One question follows an answer. You know?
Eight minutes - Eight minutes can go like that!
Yes. Yes.
Then you, uh - you got out of the car.
You went to the house, and at the door... my wife handed you the key.
You unlocked the door... and after a short conversation, you went in.
This was exactly 2:51.
Uh -Am I boring you?
Oh, not at all, Professor.
Uh, yes, y-your wife - your wife said...
"Wort you come up and have a little brandy?"
And I said, "Ah, a little brandy can't hurt."
- So, I - I went up. - Yes.
And, uh - And you had the brandy?
Yes.
Was it good brandy, Doctor?
Excellent, Professor.
You drank this brandy from 2:53... to 4:44.
Professor, I assure you... that there is absolutely nothing wrong.
We just -We just had a chat... and a few laughs.
You know, y-your wife - your wife is very amusing.
Yes, everyone says so. It must be true.
Now, Professor, all appearances are against me.
I know. I know. But let me tell you again -
Not another word, Doctor.
- I believe you. - Thank you.
You're very welcome. I believe you.
But no one else will. Too bad, isn't it?
I just came up here this morning to ask you... if you would appear, voluntarily, as a... shall we say, witness in my divorce suit?
Professor, please believe me.
I'm an innocent man.
I'm not guilty. And neither is Mitzi.
I mean - I mean, your wife.
My friend - May I call you my friend?
- Please. - My friend, nobody is guilty.
I have a theory that nobody is responsible for their actions.
Right! That's absolutely right.
Our doings are controlled by circumstances over which we have no control.
Oh, excellent. Truer words have never been spoken.
Therefore, nobody can be held responsible for his actions.
Oh, what a beautiful thought, Professor.
You know - You know that you're a poet?
This, of course, has nothing whatever to do with our case.
- Good morning, Professor. - Madame.
Ah, I'm so glad you dropped in.
We should see each other more often.
I'm afraid the doctor doesn't like me.
Oh, Professor. Where did you get such an idea?
Oh, by the way, how's Mitzi?
- Mitzi?
- Yes.
Oh, Mitzi. Uh, let me see.
She left this morning for Lausanne.
- Lausanne?
- Mmm.
- Oh, to see her mother. - I suppose so.
- I hope nothing's happened to her mother. - To her mother?
No, I don't think so.
Well, we'll see. I'm sorry, but I must be going now.
Well, you must come again sometime.
And when you write Mitzi, you'll give her my best regards, won't you?
Oh, I surely will. And yours, Doctor?
Please.
- Well, good-bye. - Good-bye.
- Good-bye. - Good-bye.
Don't you think he behaved strangely?
Oh, no, not at all.
Andre?
There's something wrong between the professor and Mitzi.
Oh. What an idea, Colette.
I feel it. I feel it. My womars instinct tells me.
And there's a man in it.
Andre?
You know who the man is?
- Who?
- This Russian artist Rodovsky.
- No. No, it's not Rodovsky. - How do you know?
I don't know. I don't know. My-My instinct tells me it's not Rodovsky.
I tell you, it's Rodovsky.
All right. All right.
Let's hope it's Rodovsky.
You're right, Andre. It's not Rodovsky.
Now I know who it is.
- Who?
- That American - Goldberg.
Maybe - Maybe you're right.
I - I wouldn't be surprised if it were Goldberg.
Andre!
- I have it now. - Who?
No. No. No, it can't be.

- Have you had any breakfast?

Was -Was it a good breakfast?
Marvelous.
Had a - a good night's sleep?
Yes. Wonderful.
- Feel strong?
- Great!
Strong enough to face - to take a-a nice - a nice, long walk with me?
I'd love it.
Sit down, darling.
Darling, I've got to disillusion you.
Your instinct was right.
There is something wrong in Mitzi's marriage.
Didrt I tell you?
Didrt I tell you?
And who wouldn't believe me?
Oh, darling, tell me. Tell me all about it.
You were right. There's a man in it.
Rodovsky?
- No. - Goldberg?
- No. - But who is it, darling?
Tell me, who?
Me.
You?
You?
My husband... and my very best friend.
Look at me, Andre.
Oh!
Go away!
Either you leave this house or I do.
- But, sweetheart - - Our marriage is over.
- Darling - - From now on you're nothing but a doctor to me.
- I love you. - Tell it to my lawyer.
Believe me, there was nothing wrong in it.
I know I shouldn't have done it... but please, please forgive me for-for what I didn't do.
I don't want to hear another word!
You can keep the house, my jewels, the furniture, everything!
I don't want any alimony!
How do you do, sir?
Adolph.
Don't go.
Sweetheart, you must forgive me.
Forgive you?
I'm in no position to forgive you.
You think you were bad?
You were just a naughty little boy.
Look at me. I'm the one that's bad.
You think you're a Don Juan, eh?
Well, if you're a Don Juan, then I'm a Cleopatra.
You, with your one hour.
What's your one hour compared with my 25 minutes?
Remember the dream I told you about Adolph and me?
Well, that was no dream. It happened, right here, on the night of our party.
- Oh, so you think a man couldn't fall in love with me.
- Let me kiss you. - You think I'm not attractive enough?
Maybe I'm too old.
- Well, I'll show you. - Oh, darling! Darling.
Adolph!
Adolph, I want the truth... and nothing but the truth.
After the party was over, did you or did you not... wait in the garden till after Andre had gone?
And didn't you come into the house in the dark?
And didn't I find you on the couch?
Yes.
Well?
Sit down!
And then, Adolph, didn't you, with - with an uncontrollable impulse - didn't you untie your tie?
- Yes. - Well?
Sit down!
And then, Adolph - then didn't you take me in your arms and kiss me?
And didn't we sit on the couch, and didn't you kiss me again?
And didn't I like it?
- I guess so. - Answer yes or no!
- Yes. - Well?
Sit down!
Well, Doctor? We're even.
A tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye... an Adolph for a Mitzi.
Fifty-fifty.
But if I ever catch you aga -
Kiss me, sweetheart.
- You don't mind, do you, Adolph?
- No.
- Ladies - - And gentlemen -
- If he were your husband - - And she were your wife -
And you find out he's a Don Juan -
And you find out that she has dreams -
- And he confesses - - And she admits -
- But you like him - - And you love her-
- And you adore him - - And you're crazy about her-
What would you do?
That's what I do too.

There's a new crew coming out, and every guy that's got money enough to buy a gun   is gonna try to step into his place.
You see?
They'll be shooting each other like rabbits for the control of the booze business.
Here come the coppers.
Where's Camonte?
- Hello, Guarino.
What's your hurry?
I got lotsa time.
- Who wants to see me?
Come on, you rat!
"Tony Camonte, alias...
"Assault, carrying brass knuckles and sap, DW, disturbing peace ...
"... street robbery on three counts, loft burglary, violation Volstead Act.
"Indicted for murder of Buck Kempner. "Member Five Points Gang.
Came from New York, 1920.
At present, bodyguard and strong arm for Louie Costillo."
Bodyguard for Costillo, eh?
Pretty smart boy.
- I suppose you didn't kill Louie Costillo.
- Who, me? That's very funny.
Big Louie and me, we're like this.
Can I slap it out of him, Chief?
I'll let you have him in a little while, Ben.
This fella got ideas I don't like.
Costillo hired you for a bodyguard.
Where were you at the shootin'? I was havin' my beauty sleep.
- Where?
- In a lady's house.
You want her name?
Phone number? - She's very nice.
You been hangin' around Johnny Lovo, haven't you?
Lovo split with Big Louie.
What are you doing at Lovo's house last week?
Now, listen, Tony.
I'm gonna give you a chance. You play ball with me, and I'll play ball with you.
Last night, you met Johnny in Spinelli's Barber Shop.
What'd he give you money for? Now, listen, you.
What kinda mug you think I am?
I don't know nothin', I don't see nothin' and I don't hear nothin'.
When I do, I don't tell a cop.
Here's Epstein.
Hi, boys.
Writ of habeas corpus for the release of Tony Camonte and Guino Rinaldo.
- Who gave it to you?
All right, gentlemen, see you later.
- Hey, I-I don't go with this guy?
- No.
Listen to me.
You come into this town, and you think you're headed somewhere, don't you?
You think you're gonna get there with a gun, but you're not.
Get me? You know why?
Because you got $1,000 bills pasted right across your eyes.
And someday you're gonna stumble and fall down in the gutter   right where the horses have been standin' ... right where you belong.
Hmm.
You've got me all figured out, huh?
I've spent my life mixin' with your breed, and I don't like it. Get me?
You can hide behind a lot of red tape, crooked lawyers   politicians with the "gimmes," writs of habeas corpus, witnesses that don't remember overnight   but we'll get through to you just like we got all the rest.
- Oh, maybe me, I'm different.
- No, you're not.
I'd give up a month's pay for the job.
- Are you gonna see Lovo? - Yeah. Right away.
- Hi, boss. - Come in, Tony.
Glad to see ya. Hey.
That's pretty hot.
Silk. Expensive, huh?
I see that Epstein got to you in time.
- Sit down. - Thanks.
He said, "You stay here till the heat's off." He said ...
- [Whispering] Hey.
That's pretty hot. - That's Poppy.
Meet Tony Camonte.
Hi.
Mm-hmm.
- How are the coppers taking it?
- Huh? Oh, I didn't pay much attention.
- What about the newspapers?
- Yeah. I bring 'em along.
The News has got the best story.
Pictures of you and one of me too. Huh!
Where'd they run it, in the razor ads?
That's an old business.
It takes a long time with the pincher's, huh?
You've got an office for this sort of thing, Johnny.
Why don't you use it?
There you are, Tony. That's a bonus.
- Hey, that's a nice feel.
- That was a fine job, Tony.
Remember, that's only chicken feed.
You've stepped into big company.
You stick to me and do what I say, play square   you'll be walkin' around with lace pants and a gold hat.
- You know what I mean?
- Sure, I know.
Now, listen, I'm gonna cut you in on a percentage. Give you a raise... double.
The South Side is rollin' in jack.
All we gotta do is step in and take it.
Yeah, and have some fun with O'Hara too, huh? Who? Now wait a minute.
O'Hara's too big a guy to buck now.
There's lots of jack on the North Side.
Now listen, you. You let me think up the ideas.
I'll take care of that big hop in my own way when the time comes.
I say we stay out of the North Side.
I say we leave O'Hara alone. And what I say goes.
Don't ever forget that.
- You're the boss.
- That's better. From now on, next to me, the boys take orders from you.
Yeah, me and you, huh? That's fine talk, boss.
- Here. Have a cigar.
- There'll be plenty of work for everybody. - Costillo slowed down too much. - Yeah. [Spits]
And now he come to a dead stop. Here.
You'd better smoke one of mine.
Mmm. That's pretty nice.
Expensive, huh?
I don't like cigar smoke in my room.
Do you mind?
Listen, I'm gonna hold off that meeting with the boys a couple of days.
After Big Louie's funeral, it's better. You know what I mean? Hmm?
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.
It don't look so good. And I want you to send some flowers ... a cross of white carnations from me, see?
Yeah, and I send lotsa purple bunch.
Big Louie, he always liked purple.
Why don't you go and do it now?
You'd better make that meeting' Monday.
Well, good-bye, Poppy.
See ya again.
Expensive, huh?
Here you are, Little Boy.
Easy dough, huh   for just standing outside and listenin' to a gun go off?
- Cinch.
When are we gonna get some more? - We'll get plenty. There's business just waitin' for some guy to come and run it right.
- And I got ideas.
- We're workin' for Lovo, ain't we?
Lovo. Who's Lovo?
Just some guy who's a little bit more smart than Big Louie. That's all.
Hey, that guy is soft. I could just see it in his face.
He's got a setup, that's all, and we gotta wait.
Someday I'm gonna run the whole works.
Yeah? Remember, those monkeys on the North Side ain't so soft.
Oh, yeah?
Why didn't they come and take Big Louie before we did? Listen, Little Boy.
Do it first, do it yourself and keep on doin' it.
Mmm! [Speaking Italian]
[Italian] Where's Cesca?
Oh, I don't know.
She go out.
What do you mean?
Ain't she comin' home for dinner?
- Oh.
- That's a nice way I catch ya, huh?
- What do you mean, "catch me"?
- I wasn't doin' nothin'.
- You was kissin' him. - Sure. What of it?
- Well, I don't like it.
- You're missin' lots of fun, Tony.
- Listen, I don't want anyone ... - ... kissin' my sister. Understand?
- You're hurtin' my arm!
- I don't want anybody putting' their hands on you!
- What do you think you're doing? - Well, I'm your brother.
- You don't act it. You act more like ... I don't know.
- Sometimes I think... - I don't care what you think.
- Sure, and never have any fun.
You call that fun, huh?
That's fun.
Listen, you want real fun, huh?
Here.
How's that?
- Gee, Tony! Where'd you get it?
- Never mind where I got it.
Tony, you're swell.
Go on.
Get ready for dinner.
And remember, you do what I say.
No more fellas, understand?
Sometime, I think you crazy.
Cesca!
- What for you take that money, huh?
That's why. Give it back.
It's bad money.
Tony no got it in no good way.
It gonna bring you lotsa trouble.
What do I care where he gets it? There's nothing wrong with his giving it to me.
- Tony wants me to have a good time.
- Oh, yes? You listen! Tony no love you like he make you believe.
All the time, he smile on top   but what he thinks ...
Oh, he's got lotsa tricks.
- He no give money to nobody for nothing.
- He would to his sister. Sister. Huh!
That make no difference.
To him, you're just another girl.
Someday when he need you, he mix you up in his business   just like anyone else, and he's gonna make you bad like him.
He can't make me do anything I don't want to. I'm gonna live my own life. I can take care of myself.
Yeah?
All the time, Tony say like that.
Afterward, he no belong to me no more.
He's-a no good   and now you start to be just like him.
[Barrel Organ Continues]
That's all right, boys.
Where's Berdini, Zeigler, Meehan?
- [Man] I did. - They ain't comin'. - [Lovo] Is that all they said?
- They said you could take a flyin'... - Okay, okay.
Now we know where they stand.
All right, you guys, I'm makin' a speech.
Here it is. Big Louie gets a wad of dough, and then he gets soft.
He lets you guys come into the South Side and run beer.
Well, I'm gonna change it, see?
You can still stay in   but, from now on, you're operatin' the way I say.
Are you askin' us or telling us?
I'm tellin' ya.
We're gonna get organized, and I'm gonna handle the works.
It's gonna mean twice as much dough for everybody and half as much trouble.
- You got somethin' figured out, Johnny? - Everything.
Not being able to get it's gonna make this town thirstier than ever.
Runnin' beer ain't a nickel game anymore.
It's a business. I'm gonna run it like a business. Swell.
We've been cuttin' each other's throats long enough.
There are 3,000 saloons on the South Side ... half a million customers.
Figure that out. Add up what they're gonna lay on the line every year for drinks, and nobody in charge.
- So you're going to be it.
I make my own beer, and I got my own trucks.
I don't have to go into business with nobody.
- Where you goin'?
You sit down here, and don't interrupt the president no more.
All right, President.
- Well, are the rest of you guys in or out?
- [Men Chattering Assent]
- What about Meehan? - Yeah.
Berdini and Zeigler?
Why, they been sellin' to 700, 800 joints between them.
Yeah? Well, from now on, they're out.
Those joints buy from us. Sure.
If you try to sell at one of those places   Meehan'll turn this side of the town into a shootin' gallery.
Anything he starts, we'll finish.
You guys don't have to worry. All you gotta do is to haul beer. Yeah?
Well, who's gonna stick his neck in those joints to get the orders?
- My friend Tony Camonte.
- Yeah.
Hey, I start right now to get orders, hey, boss?
[Italian Accent] Oh, boys, I don't write.
Come on, Little Boy.
Business.
[Chattering]
- Do you ever go home?
- Once in a while.
What is this? Let go of me, will ya?
What do ya want?
Let go of me.
Let go!
What's the idea?
Come on.
- Say, what's the big idea?
- Sit down.
- Who you buyin' your beer from?
- Meehan and Berdini.
- How many barrels a day?
- Three.
He's lyin', Tony. He's been takin' five. Chiseler.
Well, you're gettin' eight now, see?
- And you're buyin' from us ... Johnny Lovo. - But, listen ...
- I can't use eight barrels around here.
I'll get ya a hunk of soap. You take a bath in it. - What are you payin' a barrel?
- Fifty. Well, ours is $65.
- Get delivery tomorrow. - What am I gonna tell Meehan and Berdini? We'll take care of them.
Well, that's order number one.
Now we get plenty more.
There's a system to these things.
[Tony] How many barrels did you say you wanted?
Well, you're gettin' 10. You're gettin' a delivery tomorrow.
Hi, boss.
[Sniffs] Mm! Lotsa garlic.
[Italian] Get me some too. - Well, how's business?
You get some more orders?
- Lotsa orders.
They all buy from us. All we have to do is fill 'em. Yeah.
That's a good idea.
You better tell Meehan and Berdini.
- Oh, them fellas, they retired from business.
- What have you been doin'?
You remember you say all they have to do is start something, we finish? - [Paperboy Shouting] Well, did ya?
- About an hour ago. - Hey! Hey, kid.
Come here. - Hey!
Extra here! - Hey! Keep the change.
- All right. Thanks.
Here you are, boss.
Look at that.
Come on.
Hey, keep this hot.
We'll be back for it.
What's the matter.
- [Man Screams] - [Gunshots]
- Hiya, Poppy.
- Hello.
Hey, what's all the time biting' you?
You afraid of me? Well, that outfit's enough to give anybody the yips.
Nice, huh?
I got three more ... different colours.
It's kind of effeminate, isn't it? Huh? Yeah.
I got 'em at an auction.
- A bargain.
- [Laughing]
You sure are a funny mixture, Tony.
- That's the first time you smiled.
- Yeah?
- Well, how do you mean you think I'm funny? - You just are. That's all.
What else are you doing with all your money?
- I hear you're gettin' a new car. - Mm-hmm.
It's different.
It's got bullet-proof glass and a steel body.
And I got myself a new house too.
Come up sometime?
Yeah. I'll bring my grandmother.
No kiddin.
You come up?
[Billiard Balls Clicking]
Hi, boss.
- When are you gonna learn that I am the boss?
- Sure, you're the boss.
Then what do you mean by breaking up that Lakeview joint last night?
- Didn't I tell you to stay out of the North Side? - Listen, Johnny, it was easy.
Now you listen to me, stupid.
That was one of O'Hara's places, and you know it.
Didn't I tell you I wasn't ready for O'Hara yet?
- It was a nice little order ... 50 barrels a week.
- I don't care if it's 50 a day.
What do you use to think with, an empty beer keg?
Just when we get this territory lined up and runnin' smooth ...
- ... you step out and gum up the parade.
- How do you mean, Johnny?
I just sell a little more beer. Aw, don't worry.
Don't worry? You know what O'Hara's liable to do now?
He'll send his guns down here on the South Side.
They'll move around like hummingbirds. You're liable to get it, and I'm liable to get it.
- I know that hop. He's tough, see.
- Aw, he ain't so tough   hangin' out in a flower shop.
You afraid of a guy like that?
I ain't afraid of anybody.
Sure, you're not.
[Phone Rings]
Hello.
Hello?
Hel... Hello.
Hello.
This Mr. Camonte's 'secetary'.
What's the name, please?
This Mr. Camonte's 'secetary'. 'Secetary', I told you.
Hey, hey, hey. Secretary, you dope.
Secretary.
O-O-Okay, boss.
I no talkin' on you. I was talkin' on Mr. Camonte.
That's my boss. - Hey. Hey hey.
- That's... Get a name.
What's your name?
No, no. I don't wanna know what's your brother's name.
I wanna know what's your name.
Listen, I come on over there, I smack you right in the teeth.
- I get you, your brother ... - Hey!
Tell him to state his business.
- [Receiver Clatters]
Who was it?
- I don't know. - What do you mean, "I don't know"?
Didn't I tell you always to get a name and write it down over here?
- Oh, boss, I forget again.
- You forget again.
Hey, what are you writin' there, huh?
- I don't know. I can't write.
- Can't write?
That's nice ... a secretary that can't write.
A secretary must be able to write, must be educated.
Get an education.
[Rings]
This Mr. Camonte's sec...
Please, you're wrong. I no hang up on you.
I thought you was through.
You have to write a letter. You have to make ...
Oh, you do, huh?
Let me tell you ...
You pick yourself a nice one.
- You get one for me? - Didn't have time.
- How many was there?
Hey.
Hello.
Who is it? I'm so ...
I don't get ...
Boss, I don't get the name.
Oh, sure.
Send her right up.
Hello, handsome.
- Hello, Tony. [Door Closes]
They tell me O'Hara was killed in his flower shop this morning.
- Did Johnny send you up here?
Johnny?
How do you like this place?
I'll show you something nice.
Steel shutters ... on all the windows.
My own idea.
- In case you have visitors you don't like, huh?
You see that?
Someday, I look at that sign and I say   "Okay, she's mine."
Yeah, I got a pretty good idea.
[Imitating Tony] That's-a pretty hot.
I'll show you somethin' what's pretty hot.
How do you like this place, huh?
Come here.
Here's some stuff I buy.
- Mm, aren't they sweet?
- Huh? You like?
I'm gonna get some ties made to match.
See, what I'm gonna do is wear a shirt only once.
Then I give it right away to the laundry.
A new shirt every day.
- Yeah.
Meaning me, I suppose.
Look at this.
I bought it at an auction. It's a buy.
Go ahead, sit down.
It's all right.
- You like it? Hmm?
I thought you were Johnny's friend.
I like Johnny   but I like you more.
Scusa, boss.
Cops is downstairs.
Tell 'em to come in and sit down. I'll be right out.
Okay.
- This is a mess.
- It's all right.
Don't get excited. It's easy.
- Oh, great.
Thanks.
- Hello, Guarino.
- You all alone?
- Yeah.
Ah, you're a cute fella comin' here all by yourself.
- No, nor 10 like ya. - Come on.
The chief's waiting. - Hey, Angelo. Call up Epstein and tell him that ...
Naw. Hey, Little Boy, call up Epstein.
Tell him there's a kidney foot here taking me down to the chief's office. Let him come right down with "habus corpis." Understand?
Hey, you know, I just hear O'Hara, he was-a met with a terrible accident.
[Boards Creaking]
So Camonte thinks he's gonna run this side of town   now that he's got O'Hara.
- [Man] He's gettin' too big.
He won't get any bigger.
We'll take him before he finds out about these guns.
300 slugs a minute.
Get the rest of them unpacked.
- How many we got? - Plenty.
And there's a lot more coming.
O'Hara had them run in across the line last night. - We'll have the cops on our necks.
- Forget it.
They can't do anything about it.
There's no law against bringing guns into the state   and we can buy all we want.
- You said it. Gaffney, listen. Camonte just left headquarters.
McGill's trailing him.
He's gonna phone. Hey, you guys.
Load those guns.
You get the cars ready.
Stick the hearse in front of 'em.
- Hello. - Hello, Tony.
Have a seat.
Hello.
Well, what took you so long? Eh, the moxie, he was late with the "ibious corpse."
Go on, order some food, will ya? I'm hungry.
You know, every time I see you, you look better.
- That's a cute hat. - Please! My stockings.
- What's the matter? - Don't do that, Tony.
They're brand-new. - Hands off, huh? - No.
Feet.
You know, I know lotsa girls.
Uh, redheads and blondes ... and all kinds.
- They all like me. - Yeah. You're pretty good, eh?
- I'm the best. - Are you gonna eat, by any chance?
I'm not hungry, except for you.
You got somethin' I like. Yeah.
I'm nice with a lot of dressing.
- You work fast, don't you, Tony? - No.
Say, I've been waitin' a long time. I'm crazy for you.
Everybody say, "Tony Camonte, he's a big shot.
He's got everything he wants." Yeah.
I got everything but what I want. You understand? Pardon me.
And get a name. Hello.
This Mr. Camonte's secretary.
What's your name?
I say what's your name?
This Mr. Camonte's secretary.
You have to speak louder.
Don't be a fool, Tony!
Your name, please?
[Machine Gun Fire]
I can't...
- [Gunfire Continues]
- [Gunfire Continues]
- ... say... can't...
... loud... [Indistinct among the gunfire]
That's it.
Hey, lookit!
- [Woman Screaming] - [People Shouting]
Hey, that's swell! Look, it's little. You can carry it.
Come on.
Let's get outta here.
Boss, there was too much noise.
I didn't get their name.
That's all right. The back door! The back door!
[Pounding]
Hey, look at that. Come here. Get me some shells.
Let's see if she works.
[Tony] Hey, you, call Fugatti. Tell him we want three cars ... side curtains.
Hey, Johnny.
Look what I got. - You dirty murdering' mug!
You bumped off O'Hara. - Who, me? That's foolish.
You told me to stay out of the North Side.
I stay out.
- I've been home all day, hey, Little Boy?
- Sure. - Sure. - Oh, so that's it?
I told you to lay off. I don't hear so good sometimes.
You won't be hearing anything if you go on like this.
Look what happened to me. They clipped me.
Lookit, Johnny.
You can carry it around like a baby.
Aw, shut up.! We gotta get organized.
This is only a starter.
- They'll be back after us. - What do ya mean?
We don't give 'em time. We go after them.
We throw them Micks up for grabs.
Yeah, well, when you're laying in an alley with your head blown off   maybe you'll learn how this business oughta be run.
And who's gonna do that?
- O'Hara's mob. Gaffney, he's runnin' it now.
He'll give it to you here - a pound of hot lead in the belly.
- Make sure it's him, Johnny.
- [Man] Cars are here, boss!
Hey, Little Boy, it's business.
You fix who goes in each car.
Understand? - Say where do you think you're going?
- To the North Side, like I always knew someday. - You can't do that!
- What do you mean, can't? Who's stoppin' me? I am.
I'm givin' you orders for the last time.
There's only one thing that gets orders and gives orders, and this is it.
That's how I got the South Side for ya, and that's how I'm gonna get the North Side for ya.
Some little typewriter, huh?
- Come on, fellas!
Dugan ... come on. [Amidst chatter]
It was a big, black car with side curtains   and a machine gun gave 'em the works.
- Oh, hello, Ben. - Hello, Chief.
What are we gonna do about them machine guns?
What can we do about 'em?
There's no law against manufacturing them, just against having them.
They can't get 'em in one state, they go across the border and get 'em in another.
These fellas bootleg machine guns like they bootleg booze. Yeah.
They better do something about that. Because with these toys to play with ...
- ... what happened before will look like a tea party.
- I know it.
[Whistle Blowing]
[Man] What is this, a pinch?
[Man #2] No. We're bringing you a valentine.
- Don't you know it's Valentine's Day?
- Oh, yeah.
Come on. Line up, you guys.
Over there, all seven of you.
Plenty. Face the wall!
- Here's Gaffney.
- Gaffney, what do you know about this?
Well?
Well, I was on my way here to the garage to keep an appointment ...
- ... and I was late. - Yeah? And a car drives up and some guys pile out.
Two of 'em was cops ...
at least they was dressed like cops.
- Cops. That's a new gag.
- Then what?
Well, it looked like a pinch, so I beat it around the block 'til it was over.
Seven of 'em ...
Mowed down, just like that!
- Didn't have a chance!
Fat chance!
[Knocking]
Let him in.
- Hi, Gaffney.
- How'd you find me?
Oh, we boys from the Journal always get around. - Yeah?
Anybody else know I'm here? - Nope. Just my own little idea.
- Well?
- Can't get a thing on him.
We're right up a blind alley wherever we go.
- And Gaffney's turned yellow. He's hiding out.
- What about Lovo? Lovo is practically out.
He's as scared as Gaffney.
- Camonte, all right, but we can't prove it yet.
- No, but we will. - Hey, Chief. - What do you want?
- This fellow Camonte. - What about him?
A story.
Public's interested in him. He's a colourful character.
Colourful? What colour is a crawling louse?
Say, listen, that's the attitude of too many morons in this country.
They think these big hoodlums are some sort of demigods.
What do they do about a guy like Camonte? They sentimentalise, romance, make jokes about him.
They had some excuse for glorifying our old western bad men.
They met in the middle of the street at high noon and waited for each other to draw.
But these things sneak up, shoot a guy in the back and then run away.
- I guess you're right. - Colourful!
Did you read what happened the other day?
A carful of 'em chased   another down the street, broad daylight.
Three kiddies playing hopscotch on the sidewalk get lead poured in their little bellies.
When I think what goes on in the minds of these lice, I want to vomit.
- Ben? - Yeah?
See if you can find Gaffney.
- They got all the others. - Right.
[Man] Our organisations are opposed to your policy, Mr. Garston.
Your paper could be an influence against the gangster   yet you keep right on playing up his activities as front-page news.
Murders, gang war, killing! That's all we read about!
You're glorifying the gangster by giving him all this publicity.
You're trying to tell me you can get rid of the gangster by ignoring him?
By keeping him off the front page?
That's ridiculous! You're playing right into his hands! Show him up!
Run him out of the country!
That'll keep him off the front page.
In the meantime, you expect our children to read of nothing but outrage and murder?
That's better than their being slaughtered.
The city is full of machine guns, gang war in the streets.
Kids aren't even safe to go to school.
- You want that to go on?
- Certainly not.
But what can private citizens do?
Even our police force can't stop it. Don't blame the police.
They can't stop machine guns from being run back and forth across the state lines.
They can't enforce laws that don't exist.
Then it's up to the federal government to do something about it.
You're the government! All of you!
Instead of trying to hide the facts, get busy and see that laws are passed that'll do some good!
- For instance?
- Pass a federal law  that puts the gun in the same class as drugs and white slavery!
Put teeth in the Deportation Act!
These gangsters don't belong in this country. Half of 'em aren't even citizens!
[Italian Accent] That's true. They bring nothing but disgrace to my people.
All right. I'll tell you what to do.
Make laws and see that they're obeyed   if we have to have martial law to do it!
The governor of New Mexico declared martial law to stop a bullfight   the governor of Oklahoma to regulate oil production!
Surely gang rule and wholesale law defiance   are more of a menace to the nation   than the regulation of oil or a bullfight!
The army will help. So will the American Legion.
They offered their services over two years ago!
And nobody ever called on 'em.
That Sadie Thompson, she's pretty smart girl.
What's a girl wanna hustle in a place like that for?
Yeah, it's rainin' all the time.
Yeah, that rain. That's pretty good.
That comes from a pipe, you know, just like a shower.
Them two fellas ...
Which one do you think she takes?
- The guy with the collar? - Nah. He ain't so hot.
Hey, listen. Them marines ain't so hot too.
That's a fine show.
I gotta see more shows like that. You know, serious.
Ain't got no jokes. I like a show with jokes.
That's-a dope. What more do you want?
Listen, this girl Sadie, she's got what you call a problem.
This fella with the collar, he's gonna ...
- What's the matter? - They found Gaffney.
Spotted him down at Frank's Bowling Alley.
He got in there and got in a game.
- Yeah? - It's a setup. Take about an hour to get the boys ...
I'm lookin' at a show now. Listen, it's the last act.
There's two fellas after a girl, which is called Sadie, see?
And this girl Sadie, she's been what you call ... disillusioned.
We gotta do it now!
He's liable to slip us again.
- Come on, Tony.
Ah, that's too bad.
All right, come on.
- Hey, wait. You stay here.
- [Groans]
You stay and see the show. - Aw, boss!
- I gotta know which fella this girl Sadie, she take.
It's all right, boss. The copper's gone.
All right. Come on. Hey, Little Boy, you go around the back, up on the balcony.
Red cent, side door. He may have friends.
You never can tell. Joe, I want you to stand in the alley.
If he gets that far, you do your stuff.
You keep the motor running. Bring the presents.
You stay here.
Come on, fellas.
Ah, now we'll know what happened to that girl, Sadie. Hey Angelo, did she take the guy with the collar?
Nah.
She climb back in the hay with the army.
Yeah? That's fine.
She's a smart girl, that kid.
Not bad, huh?
Just watch this one.
- Hello, Tony.
Ahhh, that's-a pretty hot!
- Hello.
- Hello, stranger.
Chair.
Well, Johnny! Well, you're lookin' swell.
I thought we were gonna see something of you.
- Well, here I am. - Where have you been?
On a vacation?
Noo. I've been workin'. Up on the North Side, huh, Johnny?
That's what the papers say.
Don't work too hard. I just finish up tonight.
You get your own table, Camonte.
- Why is that?
- This is a table for two. Well, maybe you get another table, huh, Johnny?
Hey, listen, you!
All right, go on.
Nothing seems to bother you much, does it?
Well, I get used to noises.
[Man Speaking Italian] - Hello, Guino.
- Why are you always high-hatting me?
- Go on, beat it. I suppose you need an organ grinder to work with?
Tony's inside.
He see you in that outfit? - [Crowd Applauding] - I looked pretty good from two stories up.
Am I different now? Wanna dance with me?
Listen, you're Tony's sister, see?
Besides, you're only a kid.
You like that music?
- Now do you wanna dance?
- No. Afraid! Afraid of Tony's sister!
Why, you...
Well, I notice you stood there and watched. Someday you'll find out you've been missing something.
Hey, how about it, you and me, huh?
I thought you weren't dancing. I changed my mind.
I need exercise.
I think you missed me, huh?
That's right.
We make up for lost time.
How do you wanna play, Tony?
That's it.
You wait here. I take her home myself.
- You can't!
You'll be sorry for this.
Next time I catch you in a place like that, I'm gonna kill you.
You're telling me what to do?
I'll do what I want, same as you! Understand?
- You listen to me!
- I hate you!
Never mind what I do! That's all right.
You're gonna stay home, understand?
I'm no baby! I can take care of myself!
Yeah, runnin' around with the fellas, huh?
Letting 'em hold you like that?
Letting 'em look at you?
Dressin' up like that for fellas to see, huh? What I do with fellas is my business!
- Oh, Mama. - Cesca, what's the matter?
What-a Tony do to you, huh? What he do?
He hit me. He said he'd kill me, and I wasn't doing anything.
- I was only dancing!
- That's all right, figlia mia.
No cry. All right, tell-a Mama. Come on upstairs.
- No cry, baby.
- [Sobbing] He hasn't any right to.
Just because I'm his sister, he can't throw me around like that.
No no. All right, no cry, baby.
I tell you. I tell you lotsa times!
He hurt you! He hurt you!
He hurt everybody.
- See if you can put out his tires.
That got 'er!
- [Speaking Italian] - Just shut up.
Give us some nickels.
Give us some nickels.
Lakeside 1305.
Get me a drink.
- Hello?
- Hello.
Tony Camonte.
Is Rinaldo there?
No, Mr. Camonte. He left an hour ago.
Is Lovo there? Lovo? No.
He left too.
Bosworth 4503.
- Hello?
- Hello. Mabel?
Camonte.
Rinaldo there?
Why, no. He ain't been here.
Say, you know, I think that guy's givin' me the runaround.
I've had a date with him two or three times ...
- Maybe he going home to bed.
- Ah, what're you talkin' ...
That tom cat!
Try Maizie.
Maizie. That's right.
I forgot about her.
Uh... uh, Hatfield 6401.
Yeah, 6401.
- Come on.
- Hello?
- Hello, Maizie?
It's Tony Camonte.
Rinaldo there? Yeah.
For you.
- Hello? - Hello, Rinaldo?
I'm at Pietro's. Pietro's!
- Yeah, come right away.
- Anything wrong?
Yeah, plenty.
Go get me a towel.
I thought you weren't doing anything tonight.
I'll be back later.
This is worse than being in love with a grasshopper.
It took you a long time to get here.
- Who done it?
- I don't know, but I got an idea.
You just wait.
How do you stand with Lovo? Huh?
- Come on!
- How do you stand with Lovo?
Who's Lovo?
That's good.
Say when.
That's enough.
You call Johnny Lovo at his office at 10 minutes past 2:00, see?
That's 10 minutes past 2:00.
- You say that you callin' from the country now, see?
- Uh-huh.
- You one of the guys that took me for a ride. - Uh-huh.
Car got smashed, and I got away.
- Me and the car got smashed, and I got away!
- Yes, yes.
- You think it was Johnny?
- I don't know, but we'll find out now.
We'll be there when Pietro calls.
And if it was Johnny, he'll stall, won't he?
- Sure. - Let's go.
Open the door!
Come on.
Let's go.
What happened to you? Yeah, look.
They spoil my brand-new suit.
- Who? Coppers?
- Nah. Monkeys.
Never seen 'em before.
Somebody must've brought 'em in.
How did they get you?
They smashed my bus, took me for a ride ... almost.
You left the café alone. You oughta know better than to do that.
Where were you?
I thought you always stuck to Tony.
Well, baby, I'm glad you got away. I'd have missed you plenty. - I'll get somebody for this.
- I knew you would, Johnny.
- [Phone Rings]
I don't want to see her tonight. I'll tell her you ain't in.
Hey, wait a minute.
I'll talk to her.
Hello? Who?
No, there's nobody here by that name. What?
What?
Oh, ring off.
You got a wrong number.
You better have a drink, Tony.
You?
I wouldn't try anything on you, Tony!
We're pals! Sure, we're pals.
No!
No, I didn't do it.
You got me wrong. Listen, Tony, I brought you out here. I've worked with you.
You're the last guy in the world I'd try to cross.
You know that. You wouldn't do anything to me. Don't take me, Tony.
Gimme a chance. You can have anything I got - anything, all the dough you want.
Poppy!
I'll let you have her. I give you my word.
You can have Poppy, Tony! I'll tell her!
- No! Let me go away!
Gimme a break! I never did anything to anybody!
I never hurt anybody!
Nah, you get somebody else to do it for ya!
No!
Don't! Tony, come back!
- Tony! - [Gunshots]
Oh, Tony.
Where do you think?
Go pack your stuff.
Hey, come here.
Look at that.
Do you remember what I told ya?
You're telling me?
Why did you hang up when I called yesterday?
Too busy.
The one on the end's kind of cute. She ain't bad.
I should think you'd want something more like ... Like what?
Me.
You're only a kid.
I told you I had grown-up ideas.
You're like Tony when you go after something, hey?
He'll be away for a month.
Uh-huh. Well, he better watch his step.
This town's entirely different than when he left it.
That new crowd down at the city hall is looking for him.
The first crack he makes, they'll climb all over him.
Hand it to Hap.
Tell him to play it for what it's worth.
She got a place of her own. She say to me, "Shut up.
Mind-a your business."
- Well, is she living' alone? - Yes.
All the time that what she tell me.
But one day I follow her.
She meet a man. They go in the house together.
I look and I see her name under the push bell.
See? See what you do? Once I have a son, I have a daughter...
- Shhh.
- [Speaking Italian]
Where is the place she live?
236 Central Street.
No, no, Tony!
Stop!
Central Street.
He was goin' downgrade makin' 90 miles an hour
When his whistle broke into a scream [Whistles]
And they found him in the wreck With his hands on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam
It's a mighty rough road from Lynchburg to Danville
And the track's on the three-mile grade
It was on this road that he lost his air brakes
You can see what a jump he made
- Hello, baby.
- I'm so happy.
- You're telling me?
You do love me, don't you, Guino?
You know I do.
Never stop telling me, will you?
I'm not like all the others, am I?
You're up there all by yourself, sweetheart. We'll always be happy, won't we?
[Whistling]
Hello, Tony.
Tony, I...
- [Gunshots] - [Cesca Screams]
Speak to me! Guino, say something!
Guino!
[Sobbing] Tony, he's my Guino!
I love him.
We were married yesterday, Tony! Really married!
We were going to surprise you. Weren't we, Guino?
Oh, darling, speak to me!
[Sobbing]
He's dead.
He's dead.
He loved me, really loved me.
Don't touch me!
Don't come near me!
You're not my brother!
Don't you think I know?
He kills people!
He kills everybody!
He kills everything! He's a butcher.
That's what you are. You're a butcher!
You're a butcher!
Drive down to the house.
Come on, boss.
Come on!
Come on!
This Mr. Camonte's secre...
You'll have to speak loud. I can't hear you.
It's Poppy, boss.
I-I got her name. [Laughs]
I didn't know.
Tony, what is it?
Tony, say something.
Tony...
Mmmm. Yeah? Oh, yeah?
Did he get the rest of them?
Now let me talk to Duffy. Alright Ben, here's what you've been waiting for.
Camonte killed Rinaldo.
Put up a fight when they tried to take him   and holed up in that steel fort of his.
Get him. Take Matt and the whole outfit. I'll send more if you need them.
Now wait a minute, Duffy.
Don't lose any men.
Block off the street, put your lights on   and smoke him out away from his guns and he'll quit. Get going.
Hello Duffy?
Yeah, send those monkeys on in.
Tell Jake to stay put.
They're coming.
The police. - Cesca... They're after you.
Why didn't you shoot me, huh?
Why didn't you shoot? I don't know.
Maybe ...
Maybe because you're me.
And I'm you. It's always been that way.
[Shouting.
You two, cover that alley back of the house.
Come here, I show you what we do.
What's the difference, your fault, my fault? You're here, that's all what matters.
- Here, you load them.
Huh? - Sure I'll load them. - I'm not afraid.
- That's the way to talk.
You're not afraid. Come on, we'll show them.
Here. Put it here, Cesca.
Put it right here.
We'll show them.
[Laughs maniacally]
They think they'll get Tony Camonte, eh?
[Laughs]
Steel! All steel!
All steel. No one can get in here.
Hey Cesca, you and me huh? We'll show them.
We'll lick them all. The North Side, the South Side.
We'll lick the whole world!
[laughs]
[Gunfire]
Let me lie down, Tony.
- It doesn't hurt, really.
Just put your arms around me, Tony.
Just for a minute. - Cesca!
- I won't be able to help you now. No, you can't go away.
I won't let you, honey.
I won't let you.
So dizzy.
Hold me, Tony.
- Don't let me get scared.
- Listen you don't understand.
I'll be here all alone.
- You can't leave me here all alone. - Why Tony ...
- You're afraid. Don't be afraid.
- Cesca, you're all I got left.
Little Boy, he's gone.
Angelo, he's gone.
I'm no good without you, Cesca. I'm no good with myself.
Cesca... [Gunfire] Cesca, they're out there.
Cesca, they won't give me a chance. Please. Cesca!
Guino wasn't afraid.
[Sirens]
I won't let you go. You hear? I won't let you.
You understand? You gotta stay here. You hear me?
I don't want to stay. You're afraid.
Guino.
Come back, I say. Hurry up with that gas.
- That second window up there.
Cesca!
Cesca!
Angelo!
[Crowd shouts] Get him out of there!
[Coughs and splutters]
Look, I'm all alone. I got no gun, see.
- Give me a break, will ya Guarino. - Break? Who did you ever give a break to?
Look, I got nobody.
I'm all alone.
Little Boy is gone. Angelo is gone.
My steel shutters don't work. - Shut up. Come down.
- Sure, I'll come down. I'll come down. Give me a break will ya.
Don't shoot. You got me covered. Me, I can't do nothing.
I can't do nothing.
Give me a break, will you?
Don't shoot, will you?
Don't shoot.
I told you he'd show up this way.
Get you in a jam without a gun   and you'd squeal like a yellow rat.
Come on. Climb into this.
[Gunfire]
Burn, Rome!
Burn!
"If in the melancholy shades below
"The flames of friends and lovers cease to glow
"Yet mine shall sacred last
"mine, undecay'd
"Burn on through death
"and animate my shade
"Lo, the blaze aspires!"
- Nero.
- Go away, Tigellinus.
The fire is spreading.
Look at this.
I was in excellent voice, too.
The fire, I dare remind you... the fire is growing.
The fire?
I'd hoped it would.
Rome will be destroyed when I die.
Why not while I live and can see it...
And enjoy it?
But the palace is threatened.
It will fall.
Tigellinus, I will build another.
A fabulous one... so that Nero can be housed like an emperor.
And like a god, immortal Caesar.
Yes, now go away.
Caesar... there are angry rumours that you set fire to the city.
Caesar might do well to avoid the blame.
Blame?
What are you jabbering about?
Who blames the master of the world?
Caesar, when thousands are perishing...
Let us hope that most of the dead... are Christians.
They're increasing.
Did you know that?
We've hunted and killed them like rats.
Yet the empire swarms with them.
A dangerous superstition, Tigellinus... that teaches that the meek shall inherit that which belongs to the mighty... that accepts another god in place of myself.
It shall not live, Caesar.
Tigellinus.
Yes, divine Caesar.
These rumours about my setting fire to the city.
Couldn't we shift the blame to...
The Christians?
If the populace could learn to fear and hate them... they might destroy them... where my own minister has failed.
Now go away.
Caesar.
"Lo, the blaze aspires!
"The glowing ocean reddens with the fires
"Confessing Jove
"Then swift from all sides pour
"The hissing brands
"The curling volumes rise
"And sheets of rolling smoke
"involve the skies"
Devil's luck.
How much now, Strabo?
A couple of pig's eyes.
All I got.
Well, trap a Christian.
They hide in their holes like rats.
I got a nose for them.
Nero's reward.
Two hundred pieces.
Who are you?
Titus, a stranger in Rome.
How do you know me?
You were described to me.
Where do you come from?
Jerusalem.
I was sent by Paul,
- apostle of...
- Wait.
Not here.
Since the great fire, we have lived in terror.
If they killed out all the Christian lice, me and you would have to go back to work!
Are you meeting tonight?
Yes, near the Cestian Bridge.
I'll tell them Paul's message and how...
Devil take them!
You put a Christian curse on 'em!
Come.
Lice!
Hey, those are mine!
Hey, look out where you're throwing those sheep knuckles, will you?
Get your skinny shins out of here.
Hey, Strabo!
Look.
The sign of the cross.
Flowers.
Roses.
Flowers. Roses.
Flowers.
You ought to close up shop on a day like this, Tybul.
Why, today?
Well, the rains are over and everybody's out.
You ought to give yourself a holiday.
If I played, I'd bring the rains back.
- You would.
- Look, Christians!
- Where?
- Down there.
- I know.
There was a sign in the dust.
- Come on, there are Christians!
- Where?
- Down there.
Come on.
Down there.
Look.
Come on.
- Who are they?
- Does anybody know?
Look, they caught some Christians!
They got some Christians down here. Come on.
- Come on.
- Hurry!
- What's that?
Sounds like a street fight.
Good.
Let's go and see.
Come on.
Come on, Philodemus.
Come on!
Come on!
Look!
Nero's lions are going to eat.
Vile killers, that's what they are!
The dirty Christian dogs!
They ought to kill all of them.
Come on, come on, let's stone them!
Keep 'em back!
If they kill 'em, we won't get our money!
Hang on to 'em!
Christians!
Stone them!
Look, it's Marcus.
You dirty Christians!
I'll kill you.
Marcus Superbus!
Stand away!
What have these old men done?
We found 'em.
There's a reward coming to us.
What did they do?
I tell you, there was no...
- Me and Strabo saw what they did.
Well, go on.
- Why did you stop?
- I...
I didn't know.
What?
That it was the Prefect of Rome.
Well, all the better.
You have the highest authority in Rome, next to the Emperor, to judge this case.
Aren't you pleased?
Now watch justice go blind.
What's your name?
Mercia.
- And you?
- Favius Fontellus.
This man is Titus, my friend.
- Is this girl your daughter?
- Then why would...
- She was trying to protect me.
Well, I...
I envy you.
What is this old man to you?
- She...
- She can talk.
He's my teacher.
- Who are your father and mother?
- They're dead. - You...
You live with him?
May they go now?
What's your faith?
My friend and I are philosophers.
He's lying.
They're Christians.
- Yeah.
- Christians!
Viturius, clear the street!
There's a reward on them, Excellence.
They made the sign of the...
I said, clear the street.
Begone!
Out of the way!
Clear the way!
Begone!
- Clear the way!
- Get out!
Get out!
- Begone, there!
Begone!
- Out!
Out!
Get out!
Get out there!
Out!
Well, you...
You are free to go.
We thank you.
Is there anything more I can do?
Nothing, Excellence.
We are grateful.
Come, Mercia.
Excellence.
Still, I...
I wish there were... something more.
Follow them.
Find out where they live... and find out which fountain she goes to.
Yes, Excellence.
Marcus, my illustrious friend... will you leave your trance for a moment?
Dacia!
Glabrio!
She was a rare specimen, I needn't tell you.
Your eyesight gets better with age.
A tasty dish for your banquet tomorrow evening.
Yes.
Yes, I'll tell the cook.
- Oh, Marcus?
- Yes.
Someone expects you this afternoon.
Yes, yes.
Why, I never saw a man so distracted.
I never saw a man with better reason to be.
You mean that girl, of course.
And you said Rome was dull.
Did I?
Well, I know exactly how to stir up some excitement.
Which perfume, Empress?
The jasmine and the acacia.
We must hurry, Zona.
No.
No, not yet.
Another minute, and then we'll hurry.
Empress, a visitor.
- Marcus already?
- No, lady.
Empress.
My dear Poppaea.
Why, Dacia, you're perspiring with news.
I was famished for a chat.
I have a great deal of news.
Well, I haven't time for a chat.
Did you deliver the message?
Dear lady, of course I did.
Of course you would.
Such things are the breath of your vicious little nostrils.
- Did he say anything?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
And what does "nothing" mean?
Perhaps all sorts of things, but...
But you haven't time for a chat.
I'll tell you when to go, dear Dacia.
Zona, all of you, go away.
Will Marcus be here or not?
I told you, Majesty, he said nothing.
Did he smile, or did he frown?
Well, he didn't smile.
It must be some other woman.
And I told him the Empress wished to see him alone, and immediately.
Stop drooling, Dacia.
- Is it serious?
- I hope not, but... you know Marcus.
And there are so many beautiful women in Rome.
Dacia, you're a butterfly with the sting of a wasp.
Take off your clothes.
Get in here and tell me all about it.
Can't you think of a single reason why he let them go?
No, Excellence.
Very competent spies.
If your brains were as good as your smell for money...
Go back to that bake shop.
Ask for her.
If you can't find out anything, watch for her!
Get out!
Marcus letting Christians go free.
Why?
I don't know, yet.
But this is what I've been waiting for... to break his favour with the Emperor... and restore mine.
I... I like that cup of yours.
- Would you sell it?
It's gold!
Would you mind?
Thank you.
I'm very thirsty.
In fact, I don't know when I've ever been so thirsty.
In that case, you'd better drink it, hadn't you?
Yeah, that's right.
Thanks.
Thanks very much.
Don't you remember me?
Of course.
Well, then why run away?
You're not afraid of me, are you?
No.
You're... You're harmless enough.
In fact, quite different...
Different?
From what?
- What do you mean by that?
- I mean... many times I've seen you riding through the streets... the Prefect of Rome... in your armour, with your guard, and now you're so human.
Didn't you know I was?
Well, yes, I've heard of your reputation.
What do you...
You mean...
You mean, that I'm...
Well, yes, something like that.
Well, not all of it's true.
Perhaps not... because your face doesn't look like that.
- It's...
- It's what?
- Oh, I don't know.
It's just different.
Is that a command?
I wouldn't do that.
You could, being Prefect of Rome.
But I don't want to be Prefect with you, unless you try to leave me.
You were too hard to find.
Do you imagine you're just going to walk away from me like this?
- But I will, eventually.
- But that would be a sin.
Didn't you know you'd see me again... and that I wouldn't let you go?
I see your reputation isn't altogether false.
Do you...
Do you dislike me?
- No.
- Well, you shouldn't.
You must like me.
In such things, I... I always have my way.
No.
The Emperor commanded me to find you... and deliver this myself.
What is it?
Who is this girl?
I'm going.
No, wait.
You met her for the first time today, didn't you?
What is this message?
I'll read it.
"To my well-beloved Marcus.
"The extermination of Christians must continue.
"None may escape.
"Those who are dangerous are instantly to be killed.
"The others are to be held for death in the arena.
"This duty has long been entrusted to you.
"I charge you to be faithful."
And the Emperor's seal.
I'm going.
- I'll go with you.
- I'd rather go alone.
By this order, Marcus, any person even suspected...
I heard the order.
Then that is all.
Don't rush off like that.
One would say you wanted to follow that girl.
At your age, too.
Absurd!
Why was this order given to me in the street?
Why were you so anxious to find me?
The Emperor was anxious.
- Did you make him that way?
- I don't know what you mean.
She's out of sight.
Don't let me keep you.
And she's been in here many times... and you don't know where she lives.
You're lying.
No.
No, I'm not.
You know that it means death to hide a Christian?
I'm not hiding her.
I've told you all I know.
Are you sure she paid for the bread?
Yes.
And then...
Then she ran out... and didn't take it with her.
Wait here.
She may come back.
Mercia, Bucco says he wonders when he can have his soup bone.
Tell Bucco, as soon as the soup's ready.
Bucco, aren't you ashamed to hurry Mercia like that?
You know, Bucco... you and I get hungry about the same time.
Greedy!
I wish you could stay longer with us.
There's no time.
I must take this letter of Paul's to Spain and Africa.
It's an inspiration... to copy Paul's own word and keep it.
Mercia!
Mercia!
If you'll wait until I have finished writing, I'll help you chop the carrots.
Mercia, water's dripping from that jug.
Is it leaking?
I dropped it.
But I didn't know that...
It was surprising today, wasn't it... to see what Marcus Superbus was really like?
- In what way?
- I mean... as generous as that, and... likeable.
Yes, and he used the whip.
He was taught to use that.
He should be untaught.
Do they all know about the meeting tonight?
All except a few.
I'll send Stephan to tell them.
Come on, come on.
Why send a child on such an errand?
He's less likely to be suspected.
You saw today what can happen.
- Are they brother and sister?
- No.
Their parents were coated with pitch... and burned as torches to light up one of Nero's orgies.
They died like hundreds of others lately... holding to the truth.
- Come here, Stephan.
- Yes, Father.
Oh, I forgot the bread.
- You know we meet tonight, don't you?
- Yes.
- In the ruins, at the grove?
- I know, Father.
Well, go and tell Melos and Caius.
Keep to the narrowest streets and be careful you are not watched.
Stephan, you're not too hungry to go before supper?
No, it won't take me long.
Stephan.
Do you know why you must be careful?
Yes.
Because there is danger.
Of what?
Death.
Stephan...
I saw the Master.
Did you?
I was in Jerusalem by the Damascus Gate... when he passed.
I saw him carrying the cross.
You know what he did for us?
- He gave his life.
- Yes.
If you had seen him, you would love him as much as I.
I would gladly die for him.
- Would you?
- Yes.
You would not betray any of us?
You would be faithful even unto death?
Yes.
Stephan, wait!
I forgot the bread.
Will you stop for it?
Yes.
I'll need money.
No, I paid for it.
Just tell him, he'll remember.
He'll give it to me. Tybul knows me.
Tybul!
Tybul!
Mercia, told me to get...
Well, you're late today.
- But we...
- And you're lucky.
There's a loaf of bread left.
But Mercia forgot.
In a few minutes, I'd have gone home... and you'd have gone hungry, young man.
- Money first.
- But Mercia paid for it.
- Well...
- Don't you remember?
Of course you do.
She laid the money right here and ran out.
Give it to me.
We'll need it for supper, please.
'Night.
Come on.
I'm not certain of these words.
"According to his mercy, he saved us."
- Stephan?
- No, that isn't the knock we use.
- Who's there?
- Open!
- Who are you?
- Marcus Superbus.
- Better let him in.
- But, without any evidence, he may...
Oh, why distrust him?
Open!
Mercia, go into the other room.
Good evening.
A bolted door isn't very friendly.
We never mean to bolt it against a friend.
We are honoured, Excellence.
Is there something you want?
Yes, but I don't see what I want.
You were very kind today, Excellence.
We thank you again.
Never mind that.
Where is Mercia?
May I ask what you want with her?
You're too old to understand.
It's only a letter.
Yes.
So, I see.
I don't want to know what sort of letter it is.
At least, not tonight.
If you are Christians, it won't matter much to you, of course.
You're old.
You haven't long to live anyway.
Mercia has most of her life before her.
Why haven't you sent her away, out of danger?
Is that what you've come...
- to tell me?
- No.
I'll save you the trouble of sending her away.
I... I've come to take her myself.
- What do you mean?
- Just what I say.
Is it her safety you're concerned about?
Well, that first, yes.
Is she here, or shall I find out for myself?
Mercia.
We didn't say goodbye at the fountain.
Yes, I remember.
Just as well we didn't.
Strange for you to come here.
Why?
You might have known I would.
Only because we didn't say goodbye?
Perhaps so we'd never have to say it.
You know, this jug broke when we dropped it.
Good.
Good, I'll buy you a better one.
- Mercia.
- Wait!
The old man is alarmed, I think.
You see, I... I told him the real reason why I came.
He doesn't understand, but you will.
I want you to leave this place, come with me.
- Why?
- Because... you're in great danger here.
- As long as you continue to live... with these Christians, if they are, of course. - Why?
Perhaps you don't know what Christians really are.
I know enough.
They're so dissatisfied with the world that they'd like to destroy it.
I've heard they want to save it by making men spiritually free.
Yes.
And would even kill Caesar to do it.
I've heard they wouldn't kill even such a monster as Nero.
Titus!
Either you must die for treason... or I must forget what you've said.
Maybe you're not Christians, but you're suspected... so Mercia cannot remain here.
That's all I care about at the moment.
- She has a right to happiness.
- Your kind of happiness...
- We're not discussing that now.
- Oh, wait, Favius.
I'm glad you came, that you cared enough to come.
But you don't understand.
I belong here with Favius.
Because he wants you to stay?
Because I want to stay.
- Even if these men really...
- I belong here.
You have strong convictions.
Try to understand.
Don't you value your life any more than that?
Perhaps...
I hold my life more dearly now than ever before.
But I don't know danger.
Oh, but it's not only danger I want to take you away from.
It's this... this poverty, this...
Favius, Stephan's arrested!
- Who...
Who is Stephan?
- I...
A boy living with us.
- Why was he arrested?
- I don't know.
- Who arrested him?
- Licinius, his men.
- And where did they take him?
- To the district prison.
If that boy knows anything, they'll make him talk.
- Help him.
- Why, of course.
Because if he talks, they might take you away before I could.
Can't anything be done?
If one of us falls by the wayside, the others must go on.
Hadn't you better change the meeting place?
It's too late.
But Stephan won't talk.
Oh, poor Stephan!
Answer!
Answer!
Do you follow this Christ?
Are you a Christian?
There's a meeting tonight.
Where is it to be?
For the last time, will you tell me?
I'll make you talk.
No.
No.
No.
No.
I didn't do anything.
No.
Let me go!
Leave me.
What are you going to do with me?
Will you tell me where they meet tonight?
Will you answer?
Will you answer now?
Please!
Please, I can't stand it.
Then answer.
I won't.
Yes!
Yes, I'll tell!
I'll tell!
Well, where's the meeting?
The grove!
The grove!
The Cestian Bridge.
And who are the others?
This Mercia, is she one of them?
- Answer!
- I'm...
I...
Answer!
Wait!
He's fainted.
Bring him up.
Well, we've heard enough.
Get your men.
We'll destroy this band of Christians... and then let Marcus explain to Nero why he didn't.
What have you been doing with that boy?
- There's evidence he's a Christian.
- What did he say?
Nothing.
Unfortunately, he fainted.
If he hadn't, you would have torn a lie out of him.
It all comes from my zeal in Nero's behalf.
You'll forgive me.
Is it true that this boy said nothing?
Tell me.
What did he say?
Answer me when I tell you to!
- What did this boy say?
- Pardon, Excellence.
He cannot speak.
He has no tongue.
Get some water.
Why don't they sing loud?
- We can't.
- Why not?
Titus has come from the shores of Galilee.
He came with the Master's blessing, and to talk to you.
- Oh, give us the message.
- Give us the word.
He brings us Paul's word.
He comes from afar.
Quiet, quiet.
I am not a teacher, but one of you.
I saw Jesus.
- You saw him?
- He saw him.
I heard him speak.
Here.
Here, drink this.
I couldn't stand the pain, I couldn't.
Here, you're all right now.
I told Father Titus I'd never betray them.
I don't want to live.
I don't want to live.
The men are ready, Excellence.
What did you say to them?
I don't want to live.
Now listen to me...
Did you say anything about Mercia?
Come on now, tell me.
Don't be afraid.
- I want to help her.
- I don't believe you.
- Do you want her killed?
- No, no.
Well, then what did you tell them?
The meeting place tonight.
Will Mercia be there?
Yes, everybody!
Oh, I shouldn't have told.
- I should have died first.
I can save her if you'll tell me.
Where is the meeting?
At...
At the grove... by the Cestian Bridge... in the temple ruins.
Take care of that boy.
Nothing I want so much will get away so quickly.
I shouldn't have told.
I shouldn't have told.
"We are to become as children," Jesus said...
"with a child's simple loving vision."
If we have the simplicity... the faith, the trust of a child... we accept that which we do not fully understand.
Keep your men quiet.
Quiet, men, quiet.
For me, for all men... he lifted the black mist from the face of God.
And there was no longer the God of wrath... but only a loving father.
All that we had been taught before about the great Spirit... became suddenly a new understanding... a compassionate God to whom we could turn.
The blood of these martyred followers of Jesus... is not yet dry on the stones of Jerusalem.
Another Helen of Troy, only more beautiful.
Good night, Empress.
Morpheus give you deep slumber.
Thank you.
I'd rather have exciting dreams.
I'd love to share them.
- Look out!
- Get back!
Get back!
Careless, drunken dog!
Arrest him!
Why, Marcus.
What an impetuous young man.
Empress!
Is this your carriage?
It was.
And I might have been in it.
Oh, the gods forbid.
I shall beg your pardon properly tomorrow.
Why not tonight?
Because I'm in great haste tonight, on the Emperor's most urgent business.
Come here.
I'm the Emperor's most urgent business.
Do as I tell you!
Your wishes are sacred to everyone, Empress.
I doubt that.
Where have you been for days?
I expected you here at Dacia's house tonight.
Must I sacrifice a carriage in order to catch a glimpse of you?
Tomorrow you shall have a very colourful account of everything.
Where are you rushing to tonight?
Is it a love affair?
I hope it may end in one.
I thought it was something of the sort.
Where are you really going, Marcus?
The Empress is romantic and must understand that I...
No, I don't.
You must explain.
I will.
I will, tomorrow.
- Tonight, Marcus.
- And you will be amused.
- And so, Empress...
- Marcus.
- Good night.
- Marcus, I insist!
Follow them.
Find out who she is.
Since knowing him and since following the truth... old habits have slipped from my body.
There are no longer any earthly bonds confining my spirit.
All is at peace within me.
If every living man knew what I know... if I could be sure that the message is in every heart...
I could be wholly at peace.
As Jesus loved God, so he loved his brothers... who are also the children of God.
With understanding, with faith... he held power over all things, even death.
He proved there is no death... only a crossing over to the Father... and life everlasting.
Jesus knew it.
He lived it.
He walked the earth in goodness... telling that we're all of his blood, his spirit.
Work for one another, comfort one another... that was his cry.
Love your neighbour as yourself.
That is what he came to teach mankind.
That message is heard.
It will be carried to all men... to the farthest corners of the earth.
And God will walk among us... and you will go out into the world... and you will carry to your brothers a new life... and that new life is freedom.
Freedom as vast and beautiful as heaven is.
And...
Why, look!
It's an arrow!
He's hit.
Titus is shot.
Where did it come from?
- Look!
- The Emperor's soldiers!
Flank out.
We are betrayed.
Oh, merciful Father!
Titus!
Titus!
Put out the brands!
Death is nothing to fear.
Father, no!
Father!
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done... on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses... as we forgive those... who trespass against us.
Blessed are they who are persecuted for...
Favius!
Mercia, my dear.
I...
It's Marcus!
Marcus Superbus!
Hark, the Prefect.
Stop firing!
Mercia.
He's dying.
- Favius.
- Come with me.
Quick.
Isn't that the girl you were talking to at the fountain, Marcus?
You couldn't have known that she was a Christian... or you wouldn't have let her go after hearing the Emperor's orders.
Why was this execution stopped?
Your apparent concern for these Christians... is traitorous.
Withdraw that.
If I was too hasty, I'm sorry.
Help him.
Can't you do something?
Peace be with you.
With you both.
Go and find them!
If you find them, make them talk!
Well, what are the Prefect's orders?
What's to be done with the Christians?
Say you will lean on me.
I can't hold on much longer.
I'm dying.
Viturius... look after the wounded... and take the others to the Martian prison.
Why to the Martian prison?
Why not to the arena dungeon?
Let it stand as I said.
To the Martian prison!
In God's name, be merciful to us!
God is mercy.
Come on.
- Viturius!
- Here, Excellence.
At the change of watch tonight, take the girl from prison.
Bring her to my house.
Put a woman servant with her.
Excellence, that's dangerous sport.
Do it.
Yes, Excellence.
Daughter.
Oh, Lord.
Mama.
Come, little sister.
I'll take care of you.
Come on, come on.
Here's one you forgot.
You...
You sent for me, Empress?
Having to send for you hurt my vanity a bit.
Oh, I'm sorry, Empress.
Leave us.
You don't need to call me Empress.
I should have been here earlier... to apologize for my rudeness last night.
Oh, don't bother.
I've since learned why you had to be so abrupt.
And you have these enemies of Nero safely in prison.
- It's true, isn't it?
All of them?
Yes.
Even this baby-faced Christian girl?
Tell me.
Even this girl who parades as innocence and purity...
- and is the scum of Rome?
- Poppaea!
Why, you're angry!
You... You misunderstand.
I have no serious interest in the girl.
Oh, don't be stupid.
All Rome knows that she's in your house...
- and Rome is laughing about it.
Sit close to me, Marcus.
I've loved you.
You've never returned that love.
You've hardly been friendly.
Oh, I know.
You haven't wanted a vile court intrigue with me.
I haven't either, particularly.
But what else is there?
So I've waited... thinking you've kept away out of loyalty to Nero... and that finally you would... comfort me in spite of it.
So I've waited... being jealous and hurt... while you played with a dozen less admirable women.
But this is different.
Knowing I cared for you... you've preferred to make a fool of yourself...
- over this Christian outcast.
- Yes, you are right.
I am loyal to the Emperor.
Too loyal to aspire to an intrigue with the Empress.
- Is that evasion?
- No, it's the truth.
Then I shall go on hoping to make you forget that loyalty.
If I can't, someday... to my shame...
I may command you to forget.
- Your pardon, Empress.
Marcus.
Do you love this girl?
Answer me!
Well, then I...
I don't know.
That says you perhaps do.
I could laugh with Rome about it if I didn't care so much.
Marcus Superbus... caught at last by a Christian wanton.
You've no right to call her that.
Oh, very much in love.
Well, why not?
It's not so impossible, so laughable.
She's young, beautiful, virtuous.
I find I'm sick of patrician women... who haven't heard of virtue.
That's a direct enough insult.
I couldn't avoid it.
I never saw a man who held his life so cheaply.
That sounds like a threat.
I've never threatened with you.
I shan't, unless you drive me to it.
The game is dangerous enough without my threats.
Tigellinus knows what you've done.
No citizen can protect a Christian from the law.
Well, in this case, I...
I can't stop to remember the law.
Then I shall make you stop to remember me.
You'll give up this girl, Marcus.
- Will I?
- Yes...
You'll forget about her entirely.
I've stayed too long.
Empress.
They were meeting openly, conspiring openly against your life... and Marcus wouldn't permit them to be killed.
Do I make myself understood, Caesar?
Yes.
My head is splitting.
The wine last night, the music... the delicious debauchery.
Caesar, will Marcus go so far as your overthrow... and your death?
Why are you always frightening me like that?
Plots against my life.
Death rides in the street with me. He eats out of my plate.
Marcus took them to prison and there released the most dangerous of them.
That can't be true.
How much further will he go?
I'll stop him right here.
I've been too lenient.
I'll make an example of Marcus.
I order him to be seized.
I shan't rest until he's dead.
Until who is dead?
Poppaea.
- Do you know what Marcus has done?
- I think it's very amusing.
- You...
I'm telling you he's turned traitor.
He's released some dangerous Christians.
Oh, just one.
A pretty little Christian girl, not dangerous to anyone...
- except Marcus himself.
- But, beloved...
Marcus is just a man with a thrilling weakness.
He took this girl to his house.
He's such a wilful, energetic boy.
Rome is amused, and you're alarmed.
Shame on you.
Caesar, the edict was not obeyed.
Yes.
Can you be amused at that, Poppaea?
I can, because it was the girl's fault.
Destroy the girl... not your most devoted, reliable officer.
Simply give Tigellinus an order to take her out of Marcus' hands.
Nero, beloved... don't listen to everyone when you have me.
You'll make a blunder someday that will make people laugh at you... the same as they're laughing at Marcus now.
- I'm not at all well, Poppaea.
- I know.
There now, relax.
Caesar, if I...
How can you disturb our beloved Emperor... when he's feeling so badly?
If it's the order for the girl you're concerned about...
I'll dictate that myself.
Beloved, there.
Marcus!
Marcus, where are you going?
Be careful, Marcus.
Ancaria won't let her go.
What ails you, Marcus?
Is it your heart or your stomach?
By Jupiter's thunderbolt, Marcus... you haven't finished your cup!
Something needs my attention, something very personal.
Keep it going!
Bring her here.
What's all this about?
Why have you left the table?
Why eat stale bread when there's luscious food in the house?
You go on back.
Go on back and make my apologies.
Luscious food?
- I see.
- Yes.
- Marcus.
- Yeah.
I hear Christians aren't digestible.
Never mind, never mind.
Go on, go on.
Marcus!
- I intended to see you sooner.
- Oh, Marcus.
I couldn't understand why you didn't.
I was called to the palace.
And then this banquet's been raging since noon.
Marcus, I told you last night...
- my life means more now than...
- I haven't forgotten that.
Suddenly everything changed.
- I wanted to live.
- You will, Mercia.
How can I now?
Some way, it will be done.
You belong here with me, and you'll stay.
You don't know what I'm saying.
I can't live if the others are killed.
- Something must be done for them.
- No, it's impossible.
Not to you.
Isn't there something?
No.
No, you'll have to forget them.
I couldn't.
There'd be no happiness for the rest of my life.
- Oh, that's absurd!
Try to help them.
What do they mean to us?
- I'm one of them.
- Not any more.
I don't understand you.
There's nothing to understand.
You're here, that's all.
They don't exist any more.
Oh, wait, Marcus.
An entirely new life begins for you.
With me.
Tonight.
I see.
Oh, Mercia.
I was very simple.
I thought there'd be something better for you and me.
Better?
It doesn't matter to you what I think or feel, so long as I'm here.
It never did matter.
Oh, Marcus... you never meant anything but to make me one of your slaves.
Don't think of it that way.
I want you here.
You want to be with me, you'll have everything with me.
- No, I'd rather go back to them.
- We have a right to this.
I can't see it like that, I can't.
Well, then something has twisted you out of all natural feeling.
Your kind of life, your faith has done it.
I've always believed Christianity was merely stupid... but it's vicious if it can do this to you.
Where is this luscious food?
Careful, Marcus.
Ancaria has blood in her eye.
If the host deserts his guests, the guests shall find the host.
And here we are.
I hope never to rise again.
Look out, Marcus.
Here she comes!
Ancaria!
Marcus!
Without you, there's no flavour to the feast.
Marcus... you and I are wasting the evening.
Why...
By the back of Venus, look!
- A Christian girl!
- I've heard of her.
Marcus plays host all over the house.
A beauty, Marcus.
Why hide her, Marcus?
So this was the enchantment.
Present us, Marcus.
Or aren't we virtuous enough?
It would, perhaps, help you both to know each other.
The lady Mercia, this is Ancaria... the most wicked and talented woman in Rome.
And my friends, who are content with life.
- Come and join us.
- Bring her out.
No.
Leave her alone.
Let's look at this model of purity.
She looks ripe enough for any party.
Tell us, Marcus, was she pleasant?
Superior to me?
Why, she's frozen with virtue.
Couldn't you warm her into life?
No.
No, I tried, but I couldn't.
See what you can do, Ancaria.
Try one of your songs.
- Yes.
A song, Ancaria.
- Perfect.
If that doesn't do it, she's dead.
A love song, Ancaria... with the pantomime.
Can you melt snow, Ancaria?
Sing.
Try it.
Dance, Ancaria.
Dance the Naked Moon!
Start the music!
- The last time she danced that...
- Don't tell!
The moon would blush at Ancaria's dancing.
- I must have missed that.
- Play!
Play the Naked Moon.
She's only got two.
Under the naked moon
I found you
We meet
I've seen you in my dreams
In dreams indiscreet
With torture so sweet
I've loved you in dreams
Breathe upon me
Draw me
Gently touch my heart
What's that singing?
The Christians, on their way to the arena dungeon.
I've danced to dirges, but I couldn't dance to that.
Go on, Ancaria. Go on.
Why, you haven't even started to undress the moon.
I can't go on when they are singing like that.
Drown them out!
A love song is stronger than a fanatical dirge.
Keep on!
Play!
Love will be warm
In the gold of your hair
Feed from your lips
Atremble with mysteries old
Persuasive, then bold
Until his madness outstrips
I breathe upon you
Draw unto you
And let love spread his wings
We have been two
We shall be one
Both throb
They're coming closer!
They're louder.
Why don't you stop them, Marcus?
Then sing louder yourself!
Play!
Oh!
We have been two
We shall be one
What are you smiling at?
Why, you...
- I told you to stop them!
- Get out!
I told you I couldn't stand...
All of you, get out!
And leave me alone with her.
- You, take her out.
- Good luck, Marcus.
You'll be back with me!
Well, right now I've got better sport.
Go on, get out!
- Get out!
- I've heard of worse.
Stop that, Ancaria!
Remove the lights.
Close the room.
Ancaria was frightened by the Christians' singing... but I'm not impressed.
- Please send me back to them.
Not yet, at least.
Not until you live as you were meant to live.
Marcus, listen to me.
I don't want to live like this.
I want to die with them.
You mean you'd give up life with me... and would rather die for a belief, for some vague...
It isn't vague.
It's certain.
One man proved it.
He changed men with it.
It's an illusion.
It's madness, I tell you.
Rome and mankind will go on as they are forever.
Your Christianity will be stamped out and dead within a year.
I know better.
Mercia, don't you see what this thing has done to you?
It hasn't let you live.
It's deformed you.
It's made love impossible to...
As you look at love, yes, not as I look at it.
I've no use for your kind of happiness.
Send me back to them.
No, you're not going to die with them.
Did you think I'd share you with this... this Christ?
Let me go.
Mercia, be honest.
You want to be with me.
You love me.
- I want to be with them.
- But with me first.
Marcus, let me go!
Excellence!
Excellence!
- Excellence.
- What is it?
From the Emperor.
What do you want?
That girl is a condemned Christian.
That's my concern.
Get out!
Not without her.
She goes to the arena dungeon... to die with the rest of the Christians tomorrow.
Take her.
- I tell you, she's not leaving here.
It's a pity she stopped you.
I like you so little...
I wish you had called your men and prevented my taking her.
It would have cost your life.
I hold the Emperor's order.
Face!
Forward!
Caesar, I pledge my honour... that she shall never menace the people of Rome... nor your own most sacred life.
Only let her live.
It must be love that has made Marcus so lenient of Christians.
Yes...
I do love her.
If this one Christian life will make our Marcus happy...
Is Nero justice in the Roman world, or merely a puppet Emperor?
What?
If he is justice... then not even one Christian can be spared... if Christians are to be killed.
Empress, have mercy.
Poppaea is right, Marcus.
I'm afraid it's impossible.
It must be possible, Caesar.
This must be made possible to me.
No faithful subject would ask it.
I do ask it.
And Nero has no more loyal subject than I.
You, Empress... who knows better than you... that I have been faithful to the Emperor?
I have the right to ask.
I have obeyed and honoured you.
I have risked my life in your service.
And all that I shall ever ask for it, a small thing to you... is that you give me the life of this one girl... whom I love, Caesar, with my whole heart.
I plead with you to spare her.
No, Marcus.
We do not want barbarians laughing at Roman justice.
This thing I ask is justice.
To achieve it, I will take steps to move the world of Caesar.
- I demand that you spare this girl!
- Marcus!
You've gone too far.
Seize him!
Nero.
Nero beloved.
Love has made him insane.
Caesar, forgive me... but spare this girl if you have any compassion.
Caesar is compassionate... but he is also justice.
I must remain justice, Marcus.
If only she weren't a Christian.
Marcus... if she would publicly renounce her faith...
Not even then.
If she renounced, then justice can be merciful.
I can't stay any longer, Marcus.
- But Caesar, she will not renounce.
- Then she dies.
Hear me.
Have a little consideration.
Would you have me late for the games?
Caesar!
You harlot.
I love you.
We can't see a thing up this high.
- I couldn't get anything better.
- The Maiuses got better ones.
Honey!
Figs!
They're in the second tier.
We won't see half what they see.
We won't smell half as much Christian blood either.
I'll wager 500 on Merius, the Gaul.
He's unbeaten.
Well, I'll take the Greek for 200.
Come along.
You would, of all the times!
Will they let the Christians defend themselves this time?
Does anybody know?
I've got two extra seats.
Would you like to sit beside me?
- How many chariot colours?
- Blue, green and red.
Green is the favourite!
As much as I've got on the green!
- Blue to beat him.
- Honey, figs.
I saw at least a thousand coffins waiting on the other side for the dead.
Do you know, I generally sink with the gladiators... and revive for the Christians.
You'll miss some wonderful things this time.
- Three programs.
- You needn't get one for me.
I've changed my mind.
The only red liquid that appeals to me is wine.
Oh, let him go.
He has a heart of cheese.
- Come on.
- I've lost my tickets.
Well, don't you remember the number of your seats?
- I heard the lions all morning.
- They're starved.
All they've had for days is the smell of bleeding meat.
Honey, figs.
It's a fine program today.
The last two's pretty tame.
Nero's said this is going to be the best that Rome ever saw.
It's about time.
The magnificent tradition of life and death combat... is going to the dogs.
Last time they had 40 pairs of gladiators... and only seven killings.
It's warm inside.
Get a fan.
- One hundred Christians!
- Honey, figs. It doesn't say how they're to be killed, just "execution."
We'll leave that to Nero.
It will be some interesting way.
- And bloody enough.
- Thank you.
Blessed are the poor in spirit... for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.
I believe, I believe.
But come down and save me now.
Soon we'll stand before God to be judged... to answer for our sin, to stand before his wrath.
His mercy, Tyros.
There is none.
Not any more.
Mercy has only begun.
- I tell you all...
- Tyros.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Daughter.
Daughter.
Stephan.
I wonder where Bucco is.
Where will he get his dinner?
Oh, Stephan, does that mean you're so hungry?
- No.
- Water.
Water.
I shall fear no evil, for thou art with me.
Water!
- Blessed are ye... - No, I'll take it to him.
when men shall revile you, persecute you... and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely... for my sake.
- We've called upon him to spare us.
- To protect us.
Where, where is he?
He is closer to us now than he has ever been.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Walk out upon the sand without fear, singing.
We have sinned.
Death is not the escape.
When even the thief upon the cross beside him... asked him to remember, Jesus said...
"This day shalt thou be with me."
Blessed are we.
He threw him over his head,
- didn't he?
Oh, God.
They are beginning.
Hail, Caesar!
We who are about to die salute thee.
I'll wager 50 pieces on the Gaul.
I'll wager that on my Grecian.
I told you we couldn't see anything up this high.
If it wasn't your wife you were taking to the racecourse... if it were some charming friend, you'd sit down in the box seats.
But of course, anything is good enough for your wife and child.
Well, the gallery was good enough before we were married.
We were interested in each other then.
The Gaul has got him!
I'll wager 300 silver... on Demos, the Thracian.
- On the Thracian?
- Thracian there.
Done.
I'll take the Gaul.
If I win, I'll give a feast.
You'll lose.
Mercy!
Have mercy!
Mercy, Caesar.
Death!
Death!
Death!
Three hundred silver.
Hail, Caesar!
Hail, Caesar!
Hail, Caesar!
Hail, Caesar!
Hail, Caesar!
Come on!
Come on!
Look!
Look!
He's got him.
Look, he's got him.
No, please.
Empress, she will enter alone.
Christ also was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father... so that we also might walk in the newness of life.
Hallowed be thy name.
In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
- Thy will be done... on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Christ also was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father.
- So that we also might walk... in the newness of life. - Forgive us our trespasses.
In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.
- It's our time.
It's our time!
- Lord!
- Lord! - Yes, Tyros, but we're not afraid.
Christ also was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father.
So that we also might walk in the newness of life.
Stand up there!
I want to be near you, Mercia.
Come on, the rest of you.
Onto the sand!
- I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid.
- Come on, get off there.
Get out!
Get out!
Where are we going?
We're going to your mother.
Go proudly, singing!
I can't.
I can't go on. I can't.
Titus said, "There is no death...
"only a crossing over to the Father."
Save us.
Are you Mercia?
- You are to wait... and go in alone. - Yes.
But I want to be with them.
The order of the Empress.
Whip the vermin out!
Our sorrow shall be turned to joy.
Joy!
I believe!
I believe!
I'm not afraid.
- I'm not afraid.
- I shall fear no evil.
Not death, but victory, victory.
Go on!
Go on!
Come unto me, all ye that travel and are heavy laden... and I will give you rest.
Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory.
Get on!
Get on!

Stephan.
I can't help it, Mercia.
I wanna stay in the world.
- But try to remember...
- I betrayed them all.
I'm sending them all to die... and I don't wanna go.
I'm afraid to go.
I'm a coward.
The Lord would hate me.
Stephan.
It was only your body that was weak, not you.
Yes.
Yes, it was my body, wasn't it?
I tried, but I couldn't.
- Get that boy out.
- Stephan.
Try to remember his courage.
Look up, trust him.
I do trust him.
I will trust him.
I'm ready.
Mercia!
Stephan, look at me.
You said you loved me.
Don't you want to be with me always?
Yes, but I...
Then go without being afraid, believing in him.
I'll be out there in a little while to go with you.
- Yes, Mercia.
- Come on, get that boy out of here.
I'll be killed first... but I'll wait for you if I can... so we can go to him together.
I'll stand by the door.
And we'll sing.
And then you'll walk on by yourself... still singing.

Dear Christ, why?
Mercia, you can't go out into that.
Mercia, we must act quickly.
I've brought the way to freedom.
I can save you.
I knelt before Nero.
There's only one way to escape this horrible death.
He'll spare your life on one condition, if you'll renounce this faith.
Mercia, do you hear me?
Poor Marcus, your eyes are tortured.
Oh, come, Mercia, a thousand gods have been called the true god... but there is none.
Each one is only a fantasy.
Yours is just a mistaken belief.
Renounce it.
No.
No, not this one.
Mercia, if you don't want to live for yourself, then for me.
I love you.
Can't you see it?
I know I told you so before, and then tried to kill your soul.
I didn't know, I was confused.
I still am, except for one thing.
I know I love you... beyond all doubt, beyond all living without you.
Mercia, I...
I prayed last night... as I imagined you always pray.
I called out to your God to save you, to give you to me.
He wouldn't hear me because I... I can't accept him in my heart.
I tried, but I can't.
So then I prayed to you.
I do now.
Oh, Mercia, live.
Renounce your faith.
Live and be my wife.
- Live and be your wife.
- If you love me, Mercia.
- I do, Marcus.
- Then don't leave me.
Don't leave me.
I love you, Marcus.
Do you know how much?
And yet I can't stay.
Marcia, listen to me.
Renounce your God in name only.
Even though I can't believe in him, I will respect him.
You'll not lose him, I swear it, if you'll live as my wife.
No, Marcus, to know that you love me is all I can have.
Mercia, how can you do this to both of us?
This is stronger than we are, much greater than our love.
Mercia, live.
- Didn't you see Stephan go out there?
- Yes, yes.
It was horrible.
I couldn't believe it.
But why should you go, too?
Didn't you hear my promise that I would follow him?
You must live, Mercia.
No, Marcus, I must follow them.
Then if you die, I shan't live either.
You must live.
If only because someday you may know what I know now.
I never will, not without you.
You could teach me to know.
Teach me to...
Come on.
You're next.
- Excellence!
- Oh, Mercia.
Marcus, beloved, someday you'll know.
I can't, I tell you.
I can't.
I believe in you, not this Christ.
Excellence, they're waiting.
Oh, Mercia, tell me.
This is all true, isn't it?
- An afterlife and happiness?
For me, too?
Even I could have it?
Yes, Marcus.
I believe you.
I believe what you tell me.
There, with this Christ, we could always be together?
- Promise me that?
- It's true.
Then I want to go with you.
- Marcus!
- Yes, with you, now.
- But it isn't fair to you.
- Yes it is, it's merciful to me.
It's some hope.
It keeps you with me, maybe always.
- Excellence, the Emperor...
- Yes, yes, we're ready.
Come, Mercia.
Why, you're pitying me, and I'm happy.
- I can't believe it.
- I'm full of strange hope.
Much happier.
- You want me to go with you, don't you?
I love you.
Well, come, then.
You'll have to go on teaching me, leading me.
Sometime I'll know.
But stay close.
Give me your hand.
I can't sing the hymn.
I shan't look up either.
I'll be looking at you... and believing you're my wife.
If it isn't Amelia, our little tower of strength from Tientsin.
And Dr. Hanson. Shades of Canton and Pearl River.
It was rain all the way. My, what a country.
- Hello, Mrs. Blake.
- Hello, Mrs. Jackson.
Come in, Mr. Pettis.
I haven't seen you since the gunboats rescued us from General Yen.
- By the skin of our teeth, too, wasn't it?
- Closer than that. Closer than that.
Step right into the living room, folks.
Everybody in China is here, literally. Everybody.
No wonder. No missionary in China would miss Dr. Strike's wedding.
No, indeed. Step right in.
Forward into battle see His banners go
And where is the bride and groom?
- They're not here yet.
- What?
She's on her way from the ship with my husband.
And Bob?
Dr. Strike telephoned. He'll be busy working among the refugees until the very last moment.
He didn't even have time to meet the boat. Imagine that.
That's Robert Strike all over.
And you say he hasn't seen her in three years?
No. They're supposed to be childhood sweethearts.
I can hardly wait till I see them kiss.
Amelia!
- Who is the bride, Mrs. Jackson?
- Megan Davis.
Finest old Puritan family in New England, my dear.
Her father's a big publisher. Very old family.
I hope Dr. Strike isn't making a mistake.
No. I hear she is young, attractive, full of energy.
- She'll need it.
- Yes.
Dedicating her life to the service of mankind in China.
Just what I did 50 years ago with my own bride, Mary.
Yes, it's glorious.
- And yet I pity her.
- Pity her?
I've spent 50 years in China.
And there are times when I think we are just a lot of persistent ants trying to move a great mountain.
Bishop, how can you say that?
After all that you've done.
Yes, I do pity her.
When I think of what she has to face, I...
Only last month, I learned a terrible lesson.
I was telling the story of the Crucifixion to some Mongolian tribesmen.
Finally, I thought I had touched their hearts.
They crept closer to my little platform, their eyes burning with the wonder of their attention.
Mongolian bandits, mind you, listening spellbound.
But alas, I had misinterpreted their interest in the story.
The next caravan of merchants that crossed the Gobi Desert was captured by them and crucified.
That, my friends, is China.
Miss Davis!
Please. Come on!
Miss Davis!
You've run down my rickshaw boy!
Yes.
That Chinaman in the car doesn't seem to care much. It was his fault.
Aren't you going to send for an ambulance?
Is he badly hurt?
Aren't you going to do anything for that boy?
He may be dying.
If so, he is very fortunate.
Life, even at its best, is hardly endurable.
How can you be so unfeeling?
What kind of a man are you, anyway?
I'm so sorry. Do you want a handkerchief?
Madam, it's raining. I'm afraid you are getting wet.
Miss Davis, I've got another rickshaw boy. Come on. Come on.
You shouldn't have done that, Miss Davis.
I couldn't help it. Everybody was so callous.
I know. But human life is the cheapest thing in China.
I do hope the Bishop's going to like them. It is a wonderful event.
Yes?
Here comes the bride!
Play Here Comes The Bride.
Here comes the bride!
Megan Davis. My pleasure.
It's been 11 years since I saw you last. Let me look at you.
Folks, this is Miss Megan Davis.
Take a good look at her, because in half an hour the poor thing will be Mrs. Robert Strike.
No, no, no. You can't get acquainted with her now.
She's got to get ready for the slaughter. Come on, Megan.
But I can't understand it.
The owner of the car looked so civilized. I wonder who he was.
Some rich merchant taking refuge in the Settlement.
But don't be fooled about his looking civilized.
They're all tricky, treacherous, and immoral.
I can't tell one from the other. They're all Chinamen to me.
Who is it?
- He's here.
- Who's here?
- The groom.
- Bobby.
Downstairs.
Here, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Here's your hat.
- Bob!
- Megan.
Let me look at you, Bob.
Will you forgive me?
I simply couldn't meet you at the boat.
- I'll forgive you anything.
- That's good because...
- Listen, Megan.
- What's the matter, Bob?
Listen, dear.
St. Andrew's Orphanage is in terrible danger.
I've got to get a safe conduct pass to get into the war zone and bring out the children.
What?
Isn't there going to be any wedding?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Jackson. The wedding will have to be delayed.
But don't you worry. I'll be right back.
Can you get a pass from the American Consulate?
No, no, no. The foreign authorities can't do anything.
I've got to get a pass from one of the Chinese generals.
That's what we call our gangsters here, generals!
- Which one, Bob?
- General Yen.
- General Yen!
- What?
You don't mean the man that expelled all the missionaries from his province?
Yes. He's in Shanghai now under an assumed name.
I think I know where to find him.
I don't see how you can possibly ask that bandit for any favors after the way he treated you.
I hate to, but he's the only man who can get me through the Nationalist lines.
I've got to go now before I lose track of him.
Where's Megan?
- I'm ready, Bob.
- Megan, you can't go with me.
Of course I can.
I'm not gonna allow you to risk your life in Chapei tonight. It's too dangerous.
If there are any bandit generals to be tamed or children to be rescued,
I'm in on it. What do you think I came to China for?
I wouldn't let her go, Bob.
If you ask me, I'm proud of her. Come on, Megan.
- God willing, we'll be back in two hours.
- With a carload of orphans.
It's great to be young.
Oh, dear!
My wedding is all spoiled!
If it isn't the war, it's the orphans.
The food's spoiled, and the flowers will be all spoiled.
It's not your wedding.
You keep still. Did you take your magnesia?
No.
- Is this the bandit's cave?
- Yes.
Now you sit right here in the car.
If anyone speaks to you, just glare at them.
Bring the General with you. Maybe he'd like to go with us.
With your provinces in the deal and you commanding, they'll get what they lack now.
- What is it?
- Money, money, money!
Keep your shirt on. Keep your shirt on.
He handles the army and the provinces.
But when it comes to money, he listens to me!
Dr. Strike. I wonder what that bird wants.
Wait a minute. You better see him.
He knows you're in Shanghai, and he may make it hot for you.
Stall him off. Get rid of him.
You are right.
Dr. Strike, my old friend.
I'm sorry to intrude like this, General, but it's a matter of the utmost importance.
Truly everything you do is important.
I want a safe conduct pass to Chapei.
What on earth do you want to go there for?
That's an inferno.
That's why I must go.
Our orphanage is between the lines. The children are in danger. We've got...
Orphans.
What are they, anyway?
People without ancestors, nobody.
Please sit down, Doctor. I'll get you a glass of wine.
General, you don't understand...
Later on, we will be entertained by some singsong girls.
Say, Doctor, have you never been curious about singsong girls?
General, will you please give me that pass?
Look here, Doctor, I am not supposed to be in Shanghai.
If my name is seen on the pass, it will do me great harm with the foreign authorities.
If you don't give me that pass, General, I'll tell the foreign authorities you're here.
Here's to your very good health, Doctor.
General, I think the boys are about ready to talk turkey on those provinces now.
No. Why bother me with the affairs of state when I have orphans to consider?
Hello, Doc. How's the missionary racket?
Say, I heard you were thinking of getting married tonight.
Yes, I postponed it to come here.
What?
You mean to say that you left the prospect of a beautiful woman's loving arms for some nameless brats?
I certainly hope she never finds that out.
Please. Please write that pass, General.
- Able to read Chinese yet, Doctor?
- Not yet, General.
- They escaped the fire, anyway.
- But the place looks deserted.
- Maybe they've gone.
- Miss Reed wouldn't go.
Soldiers.
- What do they want?
- They're laughing, so it must be all right.
Stand back from the door, dear. They're liable to shoot.
Where are the children?
In the next room. There are only six are left. The rest were taken away by friends.
- Good. We can take them all in one trip.
- All right, Dr. Strike.
Bob, I don't trust that pass.
Do you think we ought to risk taking the children out now?
They've taken our car!
Never mind. We'll have to take a chance on foot.
No, Doctor. I'm responsible for these children.
They were placed in my care. I can't risk their lives on foot.
But the fire's only a block away. We can get a rickshaw to the North Station.
Please, Miss Reed, we ought to do what Bob says.
Megan.
Megan.
Megan, I think you better take this pass in case we get separated.
Come on, now. Stick close together.
Straight ahead, Megan.
Megan, get back here.
Get back here.
Come on. Let's get out.
- Come on, babies.
- Go straight ahead.
Megan, there's the North Station over there.
God give you help, Doctor!
Bob!
Bob!
Feeling better now?
Do you feel better?
- I believe I do.
- Then drink some tea.
- I don't think I can.
- Please try.
You mustn't be frightened. No one will hurt you here.
Please try and drink some tea.
The General thinks it will do you good.
The General?
I'm terribly sorry for you.
But you are all right now.
I am charging myself personally to take care of you.
Haven't I seen you someplace before?
You were kind enough to offer me a handkerchief.
Yes.
How did I get here?
My car arrived just as you were being roughly handled by the crowd.
And you rescued me?
If you wish to put it that way.
- Are we on a train?
- My troop train.
I believe I'm well enough to get off at the next station.
I am sorry, only military trains are running.
There is a civil war, you know.
Will I be able to let my friends know I am safe?
Everything will be arranged. Please try to sleep now.
I will have you called when we arrive.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Uniforms. I know, all you guys think of is uniforms.
- Hello, Jones.
- Hi, Yen.
Did you raise that money?
Did I raise that money?
See, I got whole boxcar full of it.
I had to hock half your province to get it, but I got it.
- Have you heard from General Feng?
- Not yet.
He's still got another day to make up his mind.
We may have to convince him with lead instead of silver.
Keep your shirt on. I had to sell half your ammunition to get that dough.
I'll tell you when to go. I haven't steered you wrong yet, have I?
How long will it take you to put my boat in commission?
Boat?
You ain't going anywhere until you get rid of this Feng deal.
What's the matter?
Aren't you interested in this war anymore?
Where are those invoices?
Say, snap out of it, some of you guys.
Haven't got something new on the string, have you?
I want to send a missionary back to Shanghai.
Send him back in a freight car. My propaganda budget is about exhausted.
I am going to send this lady back in my yacht.
I had a hunch it was a female.
Who is she?
- A bride of a lamb.
- A bride of a lamb?
The young lady who is going to marry Dr. Strike.
I found our famous safe-conduct pass in her pocket.
Say, this isn't anything to laugh at.
We've got to get rid of her pretty quick.
We've had enough trouble with that guy Strike.
I think you have underestimated the good doctor.
He seems to have excellent taste in some things.
Yeah, well, never mind that.
I'm not gonna wait to put any boat in commission.
She goes back to Shanghai tonight if I have to send her back in a freight car.
Jones, Jones, Jones, I am afraid gallantry is not one of your vices.
Open the door!
Open the door!
Good morning. Are you better?
Where are we?
What is this terrible place?
This is General Yen's summer palace.
General Yen?
The bandit?
Good morning.
I hope you slept well.
I'm sorry.
It's terribly stupid of me to disturb your morning like this.
But there is a famine in my province, and I have no rice to feed my prisoners.
I assure you it won't happen in the future.
They have taken the rest of them down the road out of earshot.
Cigarette?
I have both Turkish and Virginia tobacco.
I've never heard anything so cold-blooded in all my life.
But isn't it better to shoot them quickly than let them starve to death slowly?
Don't go, please.
Please sit down and have your breakfast.
Why did you drug me on the train?
I don't remember a thing.
You were in great pain, and sleep makes a long journey very short.
You didn't have to bring me here. Why don't you send me back to Shanghai?
I intend to, but it isn't safe to send you back by rail.
Please sit down.
I don't believe you. You're lying.
I'm sorry, but you are making a mistake.
Dr. Strike told me all about you.
You yellow swine, if you think that...
I advise you to send me back to Shanghai just as soon as you can.
You will always find me your most humble servant.
See this.
What are you laughing at?
Tell me when she goes back to Shanghai in a freight car.
You lose. She's not going back at all.
Are you nuts?
You want that guy Strike to turn your province upside down?
Haven't you seen the Shanghai newspapers?
They think she's dead.
I think I will shave.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I've never interfered in your private affairs before, but don't forget this is a white woman.
That's all right.
I have no prejudice against color.
It's no skin off my nose.
Come in.
- Good evening, Miss Davis. General Yen...
- Sends his compliments and humbly requests the honorable presence of Miss Megan Davis for dinner for the third time.
And for the third and last time, Miss Megan Davis says no.
Mah-Li.
Were you able to send that note to Dr. Strike?
Yes.
Do you think you could send another?
I wanna make sure he gets it.
Maybe.
This is all I have left.
Can you do it with that?
- Maybe.
- Here.
Mah-Li, I'll never forget this.
Speak English. What did she say?
She said no for the third and last time.
Well?
I often envy the common soldier.
His wants are so few.
Even a common soldier would have knocked.
I did.
I almost broke the door down, but you didn't hear me.
You were evidently absorbed in the sublime effects of the spring upon my people.
What do you want?
In my province, this is called a Cherry Blossom moon.
It's a time when young and old, rich and poor, sick and sound, pay their homage to the god of love.
You think you can wear me down, don't you?
But you can't. Do you hear me?
You can't.
Please let me go. I can't stand this any longer.
Please send me back to my friends.
But I have told you. The country is in state of war.
If anything should happen to you,
I have to answer to Dr. Strike.
How long will it be?
I don't know.
Maybe a week. Maybe a month. Maybe even longer.
But I will do everything I can to make your visit pleasant, if you would only relax and let me improve our acquaintance.
It's pretty hard to become acquainted with a man who ruthlessly slaughters helpless prisoners in one mood, and in the next, shows such a tender reverence for the beauty of the moon.
You have a true missionary spirit.
Really, Miss Davis, there are times when I would like to laugh at you.
But there are also times when I find you admirable.
There are also moments when I...
Perhaps I shouldn't speak of it. I might astound you.
Perhaps you believe us incapable of such moments.
Yes, I'm sure you do.
Have you ever read our poetry, Miss Davis?
Do you understand our music?
Have you ever seen our paintings of women walking among fruit trees?
Where the fruit trees look like women, and the women look like fruit trees.
There has never been a people more purely artist, and therefore more purely lover,
than the Chinese.
- I think we ought to end this discussion.
- Certainly, if you find it objectionable.
But I wish you didn't. If you should change your mind.
If you would, follow our custom of accepting the third invitation, we are having dinner at 8:00.
Yes?
I'll give you more suitable gifts later.
Why?
That was Captain Li.
That's all right, Mah-Li. You don't have to bribe me.
- Then you won't tell the General?
- It's nothing to me.
If you wanna do something for me, help me get out of here.
Escape?
Isn't there some way you could persuade him to send me back to my friends?
But it would be easy for you to do it yourself, after dinner.
Please come. You could help me so much with Mr. Jones.
Jones?
An American?
Yes. The General's financial advisor.
- What kind of a man is he?
- He is very smart.
- I'm afraid of him.
- Could I meet him?
Yes, if you come down to dinner.
- This dress of mine looks terrible.
- I can arrange that.
Do you like this one?
I like that one.
I have noticed you were in need of powder and paint.
Yes, perhaps I am.
- I will see you at dinner.
- Thank you.
Miss Davis, I am so glad you changed your mind.
This is Mr. Jones, my financial advisor.
Hello, how is the missionary racket?
And this is Captain Li, my aide.
Hello, ma'am.
Please.
You are a newcomer in China, I take it.
Yes, I landed four days ago.
You are learning an awful lot about China in four days.
I certainly am.
No champagne?
That's Pol Roger, 1906.
- I wonder if I could have a glass of water.
- Water?
You'll catch your death of typhoid.
To your health, Miss Davis.
And the same to you, Mrs. Yen.
That chair is for my wife, who does not exist as yet.
You see, Mah-Li isn't his wife.
She isn't even allowed to sit on the same level with us.
She may seem kind of lonely tonight, but I have seen her with plenty of company.
I was greatly relieved tonight when I heard there was another American in this strange place.
Thank you for the compliment.
But I guess I am what's known in the dime novels as a renegade, and a darn good one at that.
I don't think I would be much of a relief to anybody.
What's that?
I was just trying to find out the duties of a financial advisor.
He is the secretary of my treasury.
I am the big squeeze and if I do say it myself,
I can milk more money out of this province than any man alive.
You advise the General on other matters, too?
Sure I do. But he never takes it, except when it comes to money.
Then he's all ears. Aren't you, General?
Well, as they say in your country, money talks.
Money talks in any country.
Wait till you hear how that boxcar full of money
I've got out there is going to talk.
$6 million Mex can make a lot of noise in any language.
I thought you had asked me not to mention that, Jones.
We're all friends here.
Besides, Mah-Li knows anyway.
I didn't tell her.
You're not the only man around this ranch who tells her things.
We play dealer's choice, Miss Davis.
Stud, Jackpot, Spit in the Ocean, Roodles, anything you like.
- I'm sorry, I haven't any money.
- I'll be glad to carry you.
- It's only a friendly little game.
- No, thanks, I think I'll watch.
How about you, General?
- Pass.
- $2.
$10 more.
Not me. I thought you said you passed.
I'll raise you $10.
$10 more.
He loves to steal the pot.
Don't pay any attention to Jones. He has a bad liver.
Don't try to kid me, General.
Don't I know you better than you do yourself?
Him and me, thick as thieves.
- Don't you tell me everything you know?
- Do I?
And if you don't, don't I know how to find it out anyway?
- I don't know. Do you?
- Sure I do.
All I have to do is give $50 to the General's bodyguard.
- You give too much.
- Sometimes I give more than that.
Yes, sir.
$500 Mex to Captain Li, and you can get the lowdown on whatever happens around here.
How many cards?
Two.
And how does Captain Li know?
You better ask Captain Li about that.
How pretty.
Do you know good jade when you see it?
Valuable as diamonds, jade like that.
You like them?
- Look at them closely.
- Yes, they're lovely.
I want you to keep them. They're yours.
They're yours.
Put them on and wear them.
I couldn't think of it, really.
I don't want them.
But you must take them. I assure you they're mine to give.
Please take them.
It was cruel of you both to humiliate her that way. It was disgusting.
Nice girl, Mah-Li.
Raised in a mission school, she tells me.
She's charming and I'm quite sure she's good.
That's an idea.
Now you're talking.
What about this one?
Come on, gigolo.
Don't forget your rings, Miss Davis.
How could you employ a man like that?
Jones has everything I want of the Western mind.
I don't follow you.
As long as I can make my interests his interests, he is not going to betray me.
But your Dr. Strike is unreliable as a friend, and also as a lover.
He'll betray you every time for his God.
The subtlety of you Orientals is very much over-estimated.
I can't get the connection.
East or West, men seldom deviate very far from their main passion in life.
You might as well know once and for all that Bob Strike is everything I want or ever will want in a man.
Put it on the table.
Come in.
- Here are your rings, Mah-Li.
- But the General gave them to you.
I am giving them back to you, General or no General.
Miss Davis.
Will you send them to my parents when you get back to Shanghai?
They live in Soochow and they are very poor.
I'll write the address.
Why don't you take them yourself?
That's impossible.
Impossible?
What's the General going to do with you?
You've got a chill, Mah-Li.
You go right straight to bed. I'll order some hot tea.
No, don't bother.
See, I have my hot-water bottle.
That'll keep me warm long enough.
They aren't going to take me far. Goodbye, Miss Davis.
Look here, Mah-Li.
I've wanted to tell you from the first that if I could ever help you in any way, I would.
That's what I came to China for. To help people.
You're very kind.
But I am waiting for the guards to take me away.
Guards?
What guards?
Where are they taking you?
Not far.
No, they won't.
You stay right here, Mah-Li. I'll go and see the General.
What's the idea, Miss Davis?
Isn't it long past your bedtime?
Is that any of your business, Mr. Jones?
No, you don't fool me even a little bit, young lady.
Mah-Li has been spilling her grief to you, and you're all steamed up with Christian charity.
- Then it's true.
- Sure it's true. But you keep out of it.
Besides, the General's gone to bed.
- If you think I am going to let that child...
- Now, Miss Davis, maybe you think I acted pretty rotten tonight, but I know what I'm talking about.
Mah-Li is not your kind.
She's just a conniving little dame who deserves every bit that's coming to her.
- Including murder, I suppose.
- You let the General be the judge of that.
He runs his own show out here with about 50 centuries of authority back of him.
You missionaries come out here and expect to convert 500 million people overnight.
Why, changing a leopard's spots is duck soup compared to changing China.
You are lucky to be alive out here yourself.
Now, you go back to your room, go to bed and behave.
Not until I've seen the General. I'd like to see the General.
Please, Miss Davis, have a little common sense.
You've no right to go to his room in that getup.
Besides, I know, the General's a nice fellow. He is well-educated. He has lovely manners.
But don't forget he is a Chinaman.
If you're through, Mr. Jones, I'll do as I please.
All right, young lady.
It's no skin off my nose.
Well, Miss Davis.
What I have done to deserve the honor of your visit at this hour?
You have ordered the murder of Mah-Li.
Couldn't we speak of something more pleasant?
Here I have some excellent brandy.
It's supposed to be over 1,000 years old.
Would you like to try it?
You're murdering her just to satisfy a cruel jealous revenge.
May I?
Mah-Li has been betraying military secrets to my enemies.
Can't you silence her in some other way?
Yes.
In the old days, in the days of the Manchus,
I could have had her tongue cut out.
But now that you missionaries have taught her to read and write, she's a constant menace as long as she's alive.
I feel sorry for you, General Yen.
A powerful man like you afraid of a poor little slave.
The only way to get loyalty is to compel it.
Take Captain Li, for example.
He's the only son of a very powerful family which claims to support my rule.
All right. I believe them.
But as evidence of their good faith, I made them place him in my hands as a hostage.
Now, if they would betray me, the life of Captain Li enables me to save my own face.
That's the way we get loyalty in China.
That's why China is 2,000 years behind the times.
- Don't you see...
- Why are you so interested in Mah-Li?
I'm just as much interested in you.
- I am deeply flattered.
- But not deeply moved.
Can't you forgive her?
She is only a child.
You can always do so much more with mercy than you can with murder.
Why don't you give her another chance?
I know you feel that she has deceived you and sold information to your enemies, perhaps even been unfaithful to you.
That's dreadful. If it's true, you have a certain justification in wanting to crush her.
But I want you to think of all those things and then forgive her.
I don't know how you feel about Mah-Li, whether you love her, well, as a lover.
But that's of no importance.
I want you to see the beauty of giving love where it isn't merited.
Any man can give love where he's sure it's returned. That isn't love at all.
But to give love with no thought of merit, no thought of return, no thought of gratitude even, that's ordinarily the privilege of God.
And now it's your privilege.
General, with all you have within you, your superior brain, your culture, how can you be so blind to spiritual greatness?
Do this thing, I ask you. Do it for me.
Do it even blindly, if you must, and I promise you, I'm so sure of it,
I promise you that for the first time in your life you'll know what real happiness is.
You'll know that I...
I have one of my own.
That's what you said to me that day.
You must be sincere, Miss Davis.
I don't believe a word you say.
But when you ask me like that, I forget I am General Yen.
- Then you won't have her killed?
- But I ask myself, what do you get out of it?
You've hardly known her more than a few days.
And still you act as if she were of your own flesh and blood.
She is. We're all of one flesh and blood.
Really?
Do you mean that?
Of course I do.
Words.
Nothing but words.
- You came in here to preach.
- Not my words.
The one who first spoke them gave up his life for them.
- What are you willing to give up for them?
- What do you mean?
Surely your pleasure wouldn't be complete without some sacrifice on your part.
- Sacrifice?
- Yes.
You are so interested to save the life of Mah-Li.
Are you willing to be a hostage for her future loyalty?
Like Captain Li?
I expect nothing from you.
Nothing but words and phrases you learned in Sunday school.
You don't believe in them any more than I do.
You were wrong when you said I resent missionaries.
I despise them.
Should be another Great Wall to keep your kind out.
You've already got a Great Wall around you that isn't built of mud and stones.
It's made of ridiculous pride and inhuman cruelty.
You won't allow one single human feeling to reach you.
You want me to be hostage for Mah-Li?
All right, I'm not afraid of you. I'll answer for her loyalty.
- What the Sam Hill is going on here?
- Come here, Mah-Li.
I'm going to spare your life.
- Are you off your nut?
- Get up.
Thank her. I'm going to place you in her hands.
She agrees to answer for your future loyalty, but you know and I know the moment my back is turned, you are going to throw a knife into it.
Miss Davis, I swear I'll never betray your trust.
I swear by my fathers and by the bones of my ancestors, and by the holy book in the mission school.
I believe you, Mah-Li.
What are you up to now?
I'm going to convert a missionary.
- Here's your slipper, Mah-Li.
- You are so kind.
Now I want you to promise not to see Captain Li again as long as we remain here.
Anything you say, Miss Davis. Will you take me to the temple today?
What, again?
I want to have a prayer of forgiveness read. See?
I've written it while waiting for you.
I'm so proud of you, Mah-Li. I know you're a good girl.
Certainly I'll take you to the temple. Come on.
Here.
I couldn't sleep. Couldn't sleep. I had to get up.
We gotta get this money train out of here.
I got a hunch, and I always follow my hunches.
Between war and women, the General's got me about nuts. Come on, open up, there.
- Hello, Mr. Jones.
- I want you to take the train away from here.
Bayside Station, savvy?
Money no safe here. Money no safe here now.
- Yes, sir.
- Hide train, other place. Chop-chop.
- Tonight?
- What's that?
No train due here now.
I say, ever since this American girl came here, you've been off your nut.
You wouldn't get rid of Mah-Li when I told you. Now try and find her.
Here, take a look at this if you want to see something.
Here it is, the whole works.
Position of the money car, right down to what you had for breakfast.
Where did you get this?
Where do I get everything else around this dump?
I paid a lot of money for it.
- You wanted to see me, General?
- Yes.
- Come in, please.
- Must have been important to have me dragged down like this.
- I'll say it's important. Where's Mah-Li?
- Isn't she in her room?
No, she isn't in her room and she isn't anywhere else.
- What?
- You'll never see her again round this ranch.
- Thanks to you, she skipped out.
- I don't believe it.
You'll believe it when we all pay for it with our necks.
- Ever see this before, Miss Davis?
- Why, yes, that looks like the prayer
- Mah-Li had read at the temple.
- Prayer!
Prayer, my eye.
That thing read at the temple?
Why, there's enough dynamite in that to blow General Yen's province into the Yellow Sea.
There you are. Try that.
I told you you were crazy to listen to these screwy missionaries.
That will be enough. Everything is going to be all right.
All right?
Do you realize that your money's all gone?
Money that I've ground out of this province by the sweat of my brow?
Now, the General and I and Captain Li were the only ones that had that information.
Now, how did Mah-Li get it?
I'm to blame, General.
The paper must have been in the shoe that I carried from Captain Li to Mah-Li.
Perfect. There you are.
How long do you suppose your troops will remain loyal now?
With all that dough, Feng will buy them out right under your very nose.
You can say goodbye to this little empire of yours in about two days' time.
That will be all, Miss Davis.
You will remain in your room until you hear from me.
That's a pretty fancy price to pay for what you're counting on.
Calm yourself.
Conquest of a province or the conquest of a woman.
- What's the difference?
- Yeah?
- There's one thing we should be grateful for.
- What's that?
We finally got some skin off your nose.
Come in.
Well, Miss Davis.
You certainly gummed up the prettiest set-up I ever saw.
I had visions of making General Yen the biggest thing in China.
But you sure queered that beautifully.
I hate your insides, Miss Davis.
But you're an American. We've got to stick together now.
- Where's the General?
- The General's all washed up.
His army is deserting him as if he had the leprosy.
Darned if I'm not even out of cigars, too.
Yes, sir. He could have been the biggest thing in China.
One thing you've got to say for him. He sure can take it on the chin.
Darned if I don't believe he isn't glad this thing happened to him.
Come on, now. Don't you get to worrying. I'll get you out of this somehow.
I've been in tougher spots than this before now.
You go on, get your things together. Wait here till I come back for you.
Here. Here, what's this?
You tell the General she's busy now and can't see him.
Here, wait a minute, you don't have to see him. Here, wait a minute.
I'm warning you.
Your sportsmanship is magnificent.
Won't you sit down?
Please.
You're just in time to help me select my portrait.
Did you ever see a book like this?
It's a painter's catalog.
The idea is to select the features that most resembles one.
For example, ear number three, nose number six,
and a chin number 27, equal General Yen.
How do you like this nose?
Do you think it resembles mine?
Perhaps you wonder why I don't sit for the picture myself.
You see, a Chinese is never painted until he has joined his ancestors.
May I offer you some champagne?
May I?
In the days of our greatest civilization, we drank to excess.
In fact, one of my ancestors, a very famous poet, was drowned in an attempt to catch the moon in the Yellow River.
This portrait is of his wife who was made very unhappy by his death.
She left a very famous collection of swords.
I have them in my bedroom. May I show them to you?
Please, why do you torture me?
I'm afraid you misunderstood my purpose in sending for you.
I'm not altogether a fool.
You didn't think I meant the conventional thing, did you?
Didn't you?
Do you think that General Yen could accept anything that the heart did not freely give?
No.
That opportunity has been open to me ever since you came here.
It was your life you put up as a forfeit for Mah-Li's loyalty.
My life?
Yes. What else do you think it meant?
I see. You're afraid of death as you are afraid of life.
You want me to send you back to your Dr. Strike.
He speaks the same meaningless words as you do.
He has everything you want.
You would like to be able to boast to him that the great General Yen, whom everybody feared, was destroyed because he was fool enough to hope.
Well, why don't you go?
Go on to him.
- You taught me a terrible lesson.
- Yes.
For to be able to do good works, one has to have wisdom.
You depended too much on your beauty,
and also on the fact that you are so young.
Young and pale as a lotus blossom which blooms at night.
Torture. Real torture is to be despised by someone you love.
Bargain or no bargain, province or no province.
Do you know what I expected to do tonight?
I was coming to your room to kill you.
And then follow you to some celestial garden.
Where there is no General Yen, no Megan Davis.
Just you and I.
I had to come back. I couldn't leave.
I'll never leave you.
Silk. China gave the world silk.
We ought to be in Shanghai in an hour.
I'll bet your week in China seems like a lifetime.
Maybe it is at that.
You know, Yen once told me...
Yen's dead, ain't he?
Great guy. I don't think you will marry Strike.
I got a hunch you're going back to America.
Yen once told me you could crowd a lifetime into an hour.
Yeah. Into a drink.
Great guy. Great gambler.
He told me he couldn't lose.
The joke was certainly on him.
He lost his province, his army, his life.
Maybe not. Maybe the joke's on us.
Maybe you will marry Strike, at that.
Yen was crazy. He said we never really die.
We only change.
He was nuts about cherry trees.
Maybe he is a cherry tree now.
Maybe he's the wind that's pushing that sail.
Maybe he's the wind that's playing around your hair.
It's all a lot of hooey. I'm drunk.
Just the same, I hope when I cool off, the guy that changes me sends me where Yen is.
And I'll bet I'll find you there, too.

Cry, when love broke your heart...
Flowers bloom and wither to then grow again, when the sweet song of the birds is heard in the fields and woods.
Like a man's love comes back with wanting and regrets, like the blood runs back to the heart, that's how life circulates.
Cry, when love broke your heart.
Cry, why shouldn't you?
And laugh, like youth and beauty do when life still promises joy and happiness.
Cry, when love broke your heart.
Cry, why shouldn't you?
Eva!
Eva!
Eva!
Hello?
Dad...
Telephone.
Telephone?
Come.
Hello.
No.
No.
What?
Yes.
Good night.
Why did I have to lie?
So that I have my peace.
So that you have your peace.
What happened?
Nothing, Dad.
Nothing?
As if I could hear your mum talk.
You still have your whole life ahead.
Yes, that's exactly why.
Good night.
Daddy!
I have never understood you, neither you nor your mother.

Asking for divorce of their marriage because of unmendable differences.
Put that in the next paragraph and use stamps 5 and 10.
The request for divorce, because of unmendable differences caused by the defendant, is based on the following reasons, hyphen...
This horrible cold!
My marriage was a mistake.
The very first day of it, I realized that we didn't have anything in common at all.
Perlod.
Where is my handkerchief?
From the very first day on, the defendants behavior...
No, the defendants egotistic and careless behavior... behavior...
Is it gonna be much longer?
I need more paper.
Three more pages.
Loni!
Loni!
Okay, this evening.
But into town I have to drive alone...
Because of the people.
Where have you been?
We have been waiting for you, the whole night.
What more do you want from me?
You.
It's too late.
Are you driving into town?
Would you take me along?
A glass of water, please.
Of course.
Some change, please.
Some change, please.
Change, please...
Some change please...
There you go.
Six cylinders?
Nice car.
I'm happy that I have met you.
Today I wouldn't wanna break my neck.
I have...
I also will buy a car.
Also a two-seater.
Why should I drag along a third person?
Isn't it?
Don't you feel well?
May I take you to a hotel?
You have to take a rest.
It's the heat.
It's okay.
You will see, tomorrow you will feel a lot better.
I think so, too.
Good evening.
Do you have another wish?
No.
'My dear Mother!
Today, it is... '
Terrlble...
And I'm partly responsible.
What...?
You know who that is?
No.
I don't know...
We came here together.
I should have seen it in his eyes.
And I could have prevented it...
If I consider that he had also loved someone.
So you don't know it?
Come...
We will wait at the train station overnight.
Excuse me.
Do we now have a connection to Berlin?
No, first there is one in the other direction, but the next one has a connection.
Thank you.
There you can still sleep for a long time.
Your son had an accident. Please come immediately.
Tell him...
No...
Don't tell him anything.

Thank you, Bridges.
- Everything ready, Bridges? - Yes, sir.
I thought we should never get here in time.
I'm sure that cabbie was tipsy, Robert.
So am I. He called me his old cockalorum.
- Gave him another shilling.
You didn't mind our leaving the others and coming on home'?
Why, darling, I loved you for thinking of it.
I hoped you would.
- Oh, Ellen, what lovely flowers.
- They're from Bridges and me, ma'am, with our very best wishes, I'm sure.
- Oh, Ellen.
- Thank you both, so much.
Not at all, sir. It's a... It's a pleasure, indeed.
How sweet of them to think of giving us flowers on New Year's Eve.
Rather touching.
So touching that I almost want to cry.
Well, if you must. This evening was planned sentimentally.
Sentimentally, but not tragically.
Splendid!
You'll have to hurry up, cook, if you want to see them celebrations.
Now... Now, which would you wear, Mr. Bridges...
This nice porkpie hat or the lovely picture hat the missus give me'?
Well, why not wear them both and go as Lady Godiva? You're vulgar.
Oh, look what you're doing, squeezing that thing in people's eyes and blinding them.
You'll be blinding someone if you went as Lady Godiva.
Oh? Indeed?
Watch your step, cookie, when you're celebratin'.
You know what you're like after you've had a couple of snifters.
Don't be disgusting', Mr. Bridges.
New Year's Eve's gone to her head and no mistake.
She's been queer all day.
Says she feels like as if it's the end of everything.
Oh, so do I, for that matter.
Oh, don't start that all over again. Oh, Alf, we've been so happy here in service.
Can't bear to think what it's going to be like when you've gone to the war.
Well, don't.
You were never cut out for a soldier.
Never mind what I was cut out for.
I am a soldier now, see?
What's gonna happen to me and baby if anything happens to you?
Now, look here, old girl. You married me for better or for worse.
Not for this kind of worse, I didn't.
You gallivanting in Africa, and me stopping at home.
Oh, you got a lot to take on about, I don't think.
Look at the missus and her brother out there in that there Mafeking, besieged by them there Boers right from the beginning.
Not enough to eat, only horses and rats.
Yes, and now her husband's going and two growing boys to look after.
- Sense?
What's the sense in the war?
Nobody wanted to have a war.
We have to have wars now and then just to prove we're top dog.
Now, stop arguing and help me get out this punch or the bells will be ringing and they won't have anything to drink.
You look so beautiful tonight.
- Do I, Robert?
- Only your dress, I suppose. Very deceiving.
Yes, Robert.
- And the star in your hair.
- And the star in my hair.
And the fact that I love you so very, very much.
After ten whole years and two enormous children, how can you?
Perhaps you're hideous and ill-dispositioned and tedious really, and I never knew.
- Perhaps.
- Well, it's too late now. I'm set in the habit of loving you.
I shall never know the truth.
Oh, how wonderful our marriage has been.
"Has"?
Give the future a chance.
We don't know if there is to be a future, now.
That's a cheerful thought for the new century.
About as cheerful as the thought of being without you.
Oh, Robert, my dear, I shall miss you so.
What does it matter about the war, about the Boers?
It can't matter, really.
Aren't you forgetting about your brother Jim in Mafeking,
- hemmed in by the Boers?
- No, I'm not forgetting Jim.
- But it does seem so desperately hard. - What does?
- Nothing.
I was merely behaving badly.
- You? You couldn't behave badly.
- I suppose this war will end someday.
- Why, of course. - In a few months!
- Perhaps it'll be over before you get there.
Perhaps.
I believe you'd hate that.
I wonder if Jim's still alive.
Of course he's alive. They're all alive.
Mafeking's bound to be relieved soon.
- Just on time, sir. Nearly midnight.
- Put it down there, Bridges.
- Stay and drink with us, won't you?
- Thank you very much, ma'am. - Thank you, ma'am.
- That's right. - Mum! - Oh, the children.
How very impolite of the 20th century to wake up the children.
Mum. Oh, Joey, you awful child.
How dare you make such a noise.
Oh, darling, you haven't got a pain, have you?
- I want to see New Year. - Little boys mustn't.
What would you say if I spanked you soundly and sent you to bed?
I would say, old woman that lived in the shoe.
And what would you say if I spanked you again for calling your mother an old woman?
I would say nothing.
Mum, can we see New Year tomorrow instead? Shh.
You'll wake up Edward. By George, we ought to have the children down.
A new century is a new century.
Ellen, go and get 'em some milk to drink good luck.
- Darling... - Shh.
They're asleep.
Thank heaven they're too young to fight.
Peace and happiness for you, my darlings.
Please, God.
Peace and happiness always.
Darling, let's take them downstairs.
No, it's bad to break their sleep.
Once in a century won't matter, surely. Just for once.
- Oh, well. - Oh, Mum, how lovely!
Quiet, you naughty little scamp.
- Come along, Edward.
- What, Mum, what?
- We're going down to see New Year!
- New Year?
Come on. Put this on, dear.
- Do we sing, Daddy? - Do we not?
- This is yours, Joey. - Thank you.
- Here you are, dear. - Thank you, darling.
Nineteen hundred! Happy new century!
Nineteen hundred! Nineteen hundred!
ls Mrs. Marryot in?
- To you, ma'am, yes.
- Come on.
But, Mum, we wanted to go down and see Daddy off on the ship.
I know, darling, but you simply can't.
Joey's cold's much too bad. You wouldn't leave Joey all alone, would you?
Mrs. Harris and Miss Edith, ma'am.
- Oh, Margaret, how nice of you. - Jane darling.
Edith, run along.
Robert's gone to report at the barracks.
He's got leave to travel down to the boat with me.
Oh. Oh, then, perhaps you'd like me to stay and amuse the children till you get back.
- Oh, my dear, do. - Mmm.
Oh, hello, Margaret.
You're on parade early. - I just ran in to say good-bye.
- Oh, how kind. Uh...
What the dickens?
Stand easy.
Now, youngsters, I want you to look after your mother very carefully while I'm away.
- Yes, Dad. - And be very good and learn your lessons and all that.
Dad, is Bobs a very big soldier?
Lord Roberts, if you please. He's head of all the soldiers.
- Who's head of all the Boers?
- President Kruger.
And you and Bobs are going to fight Kruger?
That's right.
Are you going to cut Kruger all in pieces with your sword?
- You blood-thirsty little devil!
- Oh, promise you will, Daddy.
All right. Little tiny pieces.
There, I told you he would!
Oh, El, it won't seem like no time at all till Mr. Bridges comes home again.
- If he ever does come home again.
- Mother. Now what have I said?
Well, we'll all have a good laugh when he does get back.
That's what they said about my poor Uncle Harry's brother Bill in the war against the Zulus.
But they never had that laugh 'cause he was cut in half with a assegai the day he landed.
Attention!
Oh, here, here, here, here.
Now, let's have a bit of life in it.
Here, half a mo, cookie. Someone's gonna eat that pastry - you're cryin' into.
- Oh, Alf, don't be such a fool.
Oh, my Lord. Here, Fanny. You can give your old dad a smile.
Come and have a look at your old dad. Look at his buttons.
All shined up nice and bright, ain't they?
Oh, now, come on, old girl, now.
Cryin' won't do no good.
Fanny, your old dad's goin' to the war.
He's gonna be a soldier of the Queen, my lass Who's been, my lass, to sea
How many days will they be at sea, Colonel? Sixteen.
It's 6,000 miles to South Africa.
You see, they land here at Cape Town, then proceed by rail to Kimberley.
Then, by forced march, to Mafeking.
Let's hope they get there in time.
Mafeking's in a very bad way.
It's doubtful they can hold out much longer.
Isn't it a wonderful sight?
I'm wondering how many of them will come back alive.
It's come at last, hasn't it, this moment?
- You'll be brave, won't you?
- Take care of yourself. I shall probably be seasick.
Then lie down flat on every possible occasion.
- I'll try to remember.
- Bridges will look after you.
Perhaps he'll be lying down flat, too.
This is horrid, isn't it?
I must go, too.
No, not just for a minute.
I really must go.
I'm going to kiss you, then I want you to turn away and go on talking so you won't see.
Mm-hmm.
I'm glad I didn't bring Edward and Joey.
They're too young, really, and they'd get overexcited.
Besides, Joey has a cold.
Take care of yourself, my darling.
I felt you go when I said that bit about Joey.
Oh, Robert! Robert!
Well, so far, they seem to be all right.
Thank God.
Dirty old Kruger! Dirty old Kruger!
Shut up, you silly kid, firing without orders!
- But I'm relieving Mafeking. - You can't relieve it like that.
All right, then, I'm defending Mafeking. - Shut up. You're wasting ammunition.
Don't do it again! You kids have no idea how to fight a battle.
- Sorry, Bob. - Get your men and guns over there.
- You're the Boers. - But I don't want to be the Boers.
- Somebody's got to be the Boers. - And that's all a girl's good for.
- I don't want to be the Boers. - But I tell you.
I won't be the Boers! I won't be the Boers! I won't be the Boers!
Oh, you cheat!
Come on. Stop, stop!
- What's the matter?
- Edith doesn't like being the Boers. Well, and who would?
- Bang! Bang! Bang!
Oh, Joey, you're a naughty, wicked little boy. - Go straight upstairs this minute.
- Now, come here, Edith.
- Come here and don't be so silly. - Oh, go away, all of you.
Edward, take Joey upstairs.
Can't you play any other game but soldiers, fighting each other, killing each other?
Now, run along up to the nursery, all of you. And behave yourselves.
There's no escape from that tune anywhere.
- Well, shall I throw him something?
- Yes, you could throw it at him.
Oh, Jane dear.
Hi! Hi!
Will you go away?
Further down the street.
Jane dear, do sit down.
You've been standing about all the afternoon.
- I don't believe I shall ever see them again.
- Nonsense. Mafeking's bound to be relieved in the next few days.
- All the papers say so.
- Everyone's been saying that for months.
My brother's still out there, dying by inches, starvation, disease and horror.
And Robert... I can't bear to think of it and I can't stop thinking.
Oh, no news yet, Ellen.
Have a nice cup of tea, ma'am.
Don't fret about the master, ma'am.
He's all right.
You see, he's got my Alfred with him.
And we'd be bound to hear if anything happened.
Poor Ellen. It must be just as bad for you.
Well, no news is good news, and what must be, must be.
That's what I say. You'd never believe how that cheers you up.
Now, come, darling. Drink this tea. Extra!
All about the war! Extra!
Special, all about the war! - Hi! Hi!
- Latest from the front! Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you, lady. Extra! All about the war!
- Extra! All about the war! - What is it, Ellen?
What is it?
- Nothing, ma'am.
All about the war! Extra! Paper!
"No news is good news and what must be, must be."
Now, look here, Jane dear.
I'm going now, and I'm coming back at a quarter to 7:00. Quarter to 7:00.
Why? We're going out to dine at a restaurant and we're going to a theater.
Restaurant?
Theater?
By ourselves? Oh, Margaret.
Well, why not? Now, there's no sense in sitting at home fretting.
And it doesn't do any good.
We'll get Ronnie James to take us.
And if he can't, then we'll go by ourselves.
I don't care what people say.
It's sweet of you, Margaret, but I simply can't.
Now, Jane dear...
I'm going home to have a bath and to put on my new Redfern model,
- and I shall be back at a quarter to 7:00. - But, Margaret, I...
Now, don't argue.
Do just what you're told.
Robert and Jim would hate to think of you sitting at home weeping and wailing.
They're being gallant enough. We must be gallant, too. We'll dine at the Café Royal.
- Margaret, honestly, I...
- Now! We'll dine at the Café Royal.
Play louder! Play louder!
Soldiers of the Queen, wounded and dying, suffering for their Queen.
Play louder! Play louder!
- Tell me something, Ada. - What?
You're not a dairymaid, are you?
Mr. Inquisitive! Well, what are you?
- Me? - Uh-huh.
Oh, I'm lady's maid to the Princess Mirabelle.
The princess?
Then he wins his bet after all. Who?
What bet?
Lieutenant Edgar.
All the officers on the ship wagered him that he would not win the hand of Princess Mirabelle.
He said he would marry her if she was as ugly as sin.
- Oh! - He needs the money!
- Tom!
What are you doing here? - Yes, sir. - Just coming, sir.
- Stop!
Ladies and gentlemen, Mafeking has been relieved!
Come and hold this fork a minute, Annie, or they'll have to call a fire brigade to put my face out.
I once knew a woman whose front hair caught fire when she was making toast.
And before you could count ten, the whole room was ablaze.
They'd never have been able to recognize her remains
- if it hadn't been for her cameo brooch.
- Fancy that now.
And how's our ladyship today?
Who's a lovely girl?
Don't burn that toast, Annie. Kitchy, kitchy, kitchy, kitchy, kitchy.
Your dad's comin' home today, love, safe and sound.
Safe and sound.
I only hope he is safe and sound, I'm sure.
You're a nice, cheerful body, I must say.
I've had experience.
When I was a girl, a friend of mine's husband come home unexpected-like from the Crimea with no legs at all.
Stop it, Annie! Now look what you've done.
Put another piece, quick! They'll be here in a minute.
I do hope Ellen didn't cry at the station.
It does make her nose so red.
Alfred will be that pleased to see her that he won't care whether it's red or blue.
Come on, Annie. Hurry up.
- Where is Africa?
- What do you mean, where's Africa?
Where is Africa? - Don't be silly.
- Well, where is it?
I never heard such an ignorant girl in all my life.
Haven't you ever seen it on the map?
I seen it on the map.
But where is it, really?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself asking such daft questions.
Well, do you know where it is, Mrs. Snapper?
Oh, get away, Annie. You're getting on my nerves.
Well, I would like to know where it is.
I was dying and laughing at the time.
That's right, Ellen, you pay. I want to see that baby of mine.
Cheers, old blowhard. Takes my kit in.
- How much? - Half a crown.
Ooh-eh! Where's my love-a-duck?
Hello, cook. Hello, Ma.
- Where's my girl?
- There she is.
Ooh, ain't you grown?
You ain't half been feedin' her up, Ma.
Look at her smile.
She knows her old dad.
Here. Put it down there.
- Good luck, old man. - Same to you, mate.
Ooh, I thought it would never come to an end, that I did.
And all the people yelling and screaming.
Here, Alfred.
Take your great head out of that pram or you'll frighten her.
Oh, she's knows me, that's what.
She knows her old dad.
Look at her, rosette and all.
Smart as me eye. Hello.
Who's this? We haven't had the pleasure.
- That's Annie. - Hello, Annie.
Oh, welcome home, Mr. Bridges. - Well, Ma, how's everything?
- Well, I mustn't grumble.
I should just think not. I've got a surprise for you.
- What is it? - Ellen knows.
I told her in the cab. - Tell her, Ellen. - No, you.
Go on. Well, Ma... You know I said in my letters about a lad named Herbert Smart?
Yes. Ellen read your letters out loud.
- Not all of them, I hope.
- Get on with you.
You never let yourself go further than a PS and a couple of crosses. Well, listen, Ma.
This chap's got a pub. - Pub?
- A pub. A beer house.
Oh, now, don't pretend you don't know what a pub is, you rascal.
Well, anyhow, he's got a pub in London here.
But he's stayin' in Africa, so I bought it from him cheap.
Now, you can come and live with us, Ma.
What do you say?
Is it a respectable pub?
Oh, well, of course, it all depends how you behave, Ma.
You know what you're like after you've had a couple of snifters.
- Well, what do you think?
- What about them upstairs?
Oh, that's all right. I took the master into me confidence.
He helped me with the money.
Oh, I can hardly believe it, not having to live alone anymore.
Here, cheer up. Have a cup of tea.
Let's all have a cup of tea! Come on.
Well, cookie, old girl, here, how would you like to be a barmaid?
Where is Africa, Mr. Bridges?
Well, I don't rightly know where it is, but it's bloody hot when you get there.
- We're so glad you're home, Daddy!
- Ohh. I'll be glad too when you stop pounding the breath out of me.
- Children, not quite so rough. - Did you see many Boers?
Mmm? Oh, yes, lots of them. - Did you kill any?
- No, we won't go into that.
- Did you kill any lions?
- Forty-four lions, a zebra, two ostriches and, uh...
Oh, yes, a cockyolly bird.
What is a cockyolly bird?
I'll come up and tell you tonight in the nursery.
Now, then, off with you both. I want to talk to your mother.
- Can I wear your hat, Daddy?
- You may. Off with you.
Quiet, Annie.
- Paper! Paper! - What's he yelling about?
Paper! Extra special from the palace!
- The Queen! Paper! - Well, what's the matter?
It ain't nothing to concern us.
Oh, Ellen, how can you, when it concerns the whole country? What concerns the whole country?
Alfred's coming home is all that concerns me.
Well, what are you all looking so miserable about?
The Queen. The Queen?
The Queen. It says she's sinking.
- There, I told you so. - Let's have a look.
She's very old, ain't she?
Oh, be quiet, Annie. What's that got to do with it?
Well, I never seen her.
I have.
Driving along Birdcage Walk once...
Years ago.
God. England won't half seem funny without the Queen.
Mum, will Father be riding in the beginning part of the procession or at the end'?
At the beginning, darling.
He'll be with the troops that go in front of the gun carriage with the Queen's coffin.
All these crowds of people.
They've been waiting for hours, so patient and quiet.
There's hardly a sound.
I feel listless and sad...
As though her death were a personal loss.
Mum! Mum!
There's a policeman on a lovely white horse!
Oh, darling, don't jump about and get excited.
- Edward, keep Joey quiet. - Yes, Mum.
- Mum, could I ever be a policeman?
- Perhaps, if you're very good.
- Are all policemen good? - Oh, as good as gold.
Why did Queen Victoria die, Mum?
Because she was a very old lady and very tired.
Could I have another piece of cake?
Only a tiny piece, then. There.
And a piece for Edith. - And Edward. - Yes.
- There now, run along. - All right. - Here, Edith.
Here's your piece. - Thank you.
- Which hand? - That one.
- That's not my piece. - Yes, it is.
Edward's quite good, but Joey...
- Well, Edward, are you all behaving?
- Yes, Mum. - Listen, they're coming!
- The procession's in sight, - and the servants are here. - Oh, come in, all of you.
- You'd better go out on that balcony. - Yes, ma'am.
- Look! Look! There's Father!
That was Lord Roberts. He held up his hand to stop them from cheering.
Is that Bobs, Mum?
Is that Bobs?
Now, children, stand absolutely still, to attention as your father showed you.
Five kings riding behind her.
Mum, she must have been a very little lady.
Adjutant General of the forces.
Lord and Lady Cumberland.
Captain Sir Albert Montague and Lady Montague.
His Eminence, the Cardinal Humbolt de la Torre.
Maharajah of Rantoula.
Earl and Countess of Norfolk.
- I met Lady Marryot there.
- Who did you say?
Marryot...
Jane Marryot.
Oh, her husband's just been knighted, you know.
Oh, those Marryots. I know them well.
- He thoroughly deserved his knighthood. - Yes.
His war record was splendid. You don't get a VC for nothing, you know.
Mrs. Harris and Captain Ronald James. - Good evening.
- How do you do.
- How do you do.
- Sir Robert and Lady Marryot.
- How do you do. - Nice to see you.
- How do you do. - And you, Sir Robert.
- So glad you could be here. - Thank you very much.
Mr. and Mrs. Geoffrey Pellier.
How do you do.
Well, Sir Robert.
Well, my lady.
- Isn't this fun?
- I think I want to run away and hide.
However, it may get me a little respect from your children.
Oh, darling, they're wild with delight.
I'm so proud of you, Robert.
It's all you, darling. Always has been. Is my hair all right?
I remember we was just near Pretoria with the old regulars...
Fusiliers and that lot.
They all seemed sort of helpless-like.
So I went up to the commanding officer, and I said, "Look here..."
Mr. Bridges, is Harry good for a drink? - Has he had it?
- Yes. He's good for it.
- What say, Harry?
- Hello, Alf. So I went to the commanding officer.
I said, "Look here," I says.
"These lads ain't got no initiative," I says. "Righto, Bridges," he says.
"You go down and tell them from me..." - Alfred!
- Coming. "Go down, Bridges," he says, "And tell the commanding officer from me..."
Alfred, will you kindly come in here a minute?
I'll tell you what he said when I come back.
Well, what is it?
Oh, come in here.
Alfred, how can you go on like this day after day? - What's the matter?
- I thought you was gonna pay the rent to the brewers this afternoon.
- Well, what about it? - What about it?
You ain't never been on time with the rent yet.
Do you want to have us turned out of the place?
Well, I've got to look after me bar, I suppose.
You ain't gotta go and drink up all the profits.
Oh, Alfred, ain't you got no pride left?
You were so respectable when we was in service.
Well, you don't have to snap a man's head off just 'cause he wants to be his own boss.
Fine boss you are.
Dressed up like a public house loafer. Now look here, Ellen.
Don't you make me have to speak to you severe.
I'm the boss here, see? And my clothes are my affair.
Matter of fact, I was going along to the brewers now, see'?
But don't you tell me what I gotta do.
- Has he gone? - Yes, he's gone.
Hello, Fanny, me girl. Been doing your lessons? Yeah.
Come on. Give your old dad a kiss.
Too proud to kiss your old dad, eh? Come on, now.
You'll do as you're told. Go on.
Get inside. Don't stay out here playing on the streets.
Freedom ain't for everybody.
There's some that it's better for them to have a firm hand over them.
Oh, Mother. My, you are late. Here, put your books down.
And go upstairs and put on your white dress.
Go on, hurry! - Hello, Alf.
- Hello.
- Hello, Alf. - Hello there.
Hello, mate. - Hello, Alf. How 'bout one?
- No, nothing to drink.
Just going to the brewery.
Business, see? Oh, one won't hurt ya. All right.
- Only one, mind you. - That's all we're going to have, just one.
Why, Ellen, she dances beautifully.
Come here, dear.
I knew you when you were a little tiny baby.
The child's a born dancer, if you ask me.
Highly talented. Highly.
On the go, you know, from morning till night.
Have you any children, Annie?
Well, I haven't exactly, if you know what I mean.
George don't believe in families. Not in the retail business.
Now, what I mean, you've got enough to do to look after the shop.
Oh, I see.
You see, my cousin George is a greengrocer, milady.
I see.
Can I press you to another cup, my ladyship?
Oh, no, thank you, really. We've...
- it's getting very late.
- Yes, Mother.
And how was Cambridge when you left it, Master Edward?
Oh, awfully nice, I suppose. I'm at Oxford, you know. Oh, Oxford.
I've never been to Oxford. But my husband has.
Haven't you, George? Yes.
Nice place, Oxford. Very antique, if you know what I mean.
Sir Robert will be so sorry to hear of Bridges's illness, Ellen.
Ill? Alf ill?
What's the matter with him?
Before you and Annie come, George...
I was explaining to her ladyship about poor Alfred's bad leg. - Bad leg?
- Yes, very bad.
He's been in horrible agony since Sunday.
You would laugh at someone being hurt.
- Where is he?
- Upstairs in bed.
- I'll pop up and have a look at him.
- No, he mustn't be disturbed. And how did he come to have the accident? Eh...
Cycling, Annie.
He was cycling and he fell off.
I didn't know he had a cycle.
He hasn't anymore.
Well, please tell him how sorry we are. Come, Edward.
We really must be going now.
It was ever so kind of you, milady, to come all this way to see us and to give Fanny that lovely doll and everything.
Say good-bye to her ladyship, Fanny.
- Good-bye, milady. - Good-bye, dear.
Good-bye. Good-bye, Annie. I'm so glad you settled down so happily.
Pleased to have made your acquaintance, I'm sure. Good-bye, Ellen.
Please remember us to Bridges.
- We miss you both still.
- We miss you, too, milady.
Well, time changes many things, but it can't change old friends, can it?
No, milady. Oh, no, milady.
Good-bye, Ellen, and good luck.
Good-bye, Master Edward, and thank you for coming.
Good-bye. Alfred!
Oh, so this is why you wanted me out of the way, eh?
Alfred Bridges, behave yourself.
Pleased to see you again, milady, I'm sure. Welcome to our hovel.
Oh, proud and haughty, are we?
- Alfred, stop it! Stop it! - Ellen.
Dear Ellen. I'm so very, very sorry.
I quite understand, quite. I'll come and see you again soon.
You drunken great brute!
You shut your mouth.
You mind your business, and I'll mind mine. Look here, old man.
You better come up - and have a lay down. - Leave me alone!
Lot of snobs, that's what. - Lot of blasted snobs! - Now!
Now!
Oh, I'm not good enough to be at home when the quality comes. Oh, no!
I'll show you who's good enough!
I shall never be able to hold my head up again. Never!
Never!
Oh, who give Fanny that doll?
Her noble ladyship, I suppose.
Well, we don't want none of her blasted charity around here. Get out!
Come here! No, let go! Let go!
You're going upstairs. That's what you're going to do.
You're coming right up here. Blasted snobs!
She was right. She was right.
Time changes many things.
Running out of the house like that, swearing before Fanny and hurting my leg.
He needs a lesson, a good lesson. - That's right, a good lesson.
- All right. That's all right.
Look here, Ellen.
Alf will tell you how sorry he is when he gets back.
Hey, Mrs. Bridges, I think you'd better come.
Alf's met with an accident.
He hurt bad?
Yes.
Alf. Alf! Alf!
Ladies and gentlemen...
And kiddies...
I am happy to be able to announce to you the winner of this week's song-and-dance competition.
It is...
ls... ls...
None other than little Miss Fanny Bridges.
Come on up here.
It gives me great pleasure to present you with this magnificent prize, a souvenir of Uncle George and His Merry, Merry Men.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, to conclude our program,
Uncle Dick will sing Take Me Back To Yorkshire.
Edward. - We're going down on the beach.
- Oh, Lord.
We have to, dear. Your father's going to join us there.
Yes, I know, darling.
He has strong nerves. But he doesn't need a whole deputation of us to meet him.
Edith and I are going to the concert on the east pier.
Concert? How loathsome.
Nobody's asking you, my little man.
You just take your spade and your bucket and have a nice little paddle.
- Oh, Edward. - Come along, Edith.
You don't mind, Mummy?
Of course not, darling. Do just what you like.
Are those two children getting romantic by any chance?
- Romantic? They're absolutely pathetic.
- Oh, Joey, behave.
Oh, but, Mum, can't you see they've gone completely dippy about each other?
Why, it seems only yesterday they were quarreling over their toys in the nursery.
I wonder if Joey's right.
- Would you mind?
- Jane, dear, of course not. - Would you?
- My son and your daughter? Darling, you know I'd be delighted.
Well, if we're ever gonna meet Father...
- Oh, yes, we mustn't keep him waiting.
Why, Ellen, what a surprise.
Oh, milady, fancy you being here.
- How do you do, Ellen'?
- How do you do, ma'am? - Hello, Ellen.
- Oh, Master Joe. Oh, you have grown.
I got your letter, milady, when my Alfred died.
It was kind of you to write, I'm sure.
We were so sorry. - I hope your business affairs are...
- Oh, quite all right, milady.
I kept on the place.
I left my manager in charge.
We're just only here to give Fanny a holiday.
She goes to dancing academy now.
She won this prize today for dancing.
- Oh, it's lovely.
- Not half good enough, if you ask me. - Dances like Pavaliver, that child.
- Dances like who? Pavaliver, the Russian dancer.
Don't be so ignorant.
Oh, she wants to go on the stage, I suppose. - Oh, Jane darling, there you are.
- Oh, hello, dear. Oh, Sir Robert.
- Why, Ellen, how are you? - Quite well. Thank you, sir.
- Grand. - This is my cousin, Mr. Grainger.
- How do you do? - And his wife. How are ya?
I never met you before, - but I met your missus, all right.
- Oh, yes. I don't think she told me.
Why, it was the day poor old Alf popped off.
I do believe you'd rather be at that revolting concert on that peculiarly hideous pier listening to Mendelssohn's Spring Song or a great beefy contralto singing Sweet And Low.
I adore contraltos. I love Sweet And Low.
And I simply worship Mendelssohn's Spring Song.
What are your other vices?
Oh, sitting on boats with cynical young men and looking far out to sea.
Oh, but, Edith, I am not a cynic, only a realist.
Look, big steamer.
Bearing her precious human freight to the farthest flung outposts of the Empire.
Don't laugh. I'd love to be on board.
Wouldn't you?
Together? - Perhaps.
- We'll be seasick. - Hideously.
- Oh, everyone is. - What?
- Seasick hideously. Horrors.
All the same, I'd risk it.
Would you? Together?
On the loveliest ship in the world.
And the most wonderful honeymoon in the world.
Oh, Edward, darling...
Edith, I'm so terribly in love with you.
Look!
Blériot flying the Channel. He's done it!
- it's getting colder, isn't it'? - Well, that's to be expected in mid-ocean.
We're nearing the banks of Newfoundland.
- Would you like to go in?
- No. It's all right.
- Too big, the Atlantic. Isn't it? - Far too big.
- Ooh, and too deep.
- Oh, much, much too deep. I don't care a bit.
Not a scrap.
Wouldn't it be awful if a magician came to us and said,
"Unless you count, accurately, every single fish in the Atlantic,
- "you will die tonight." - We should die tonight?
How much would you mind...
Dying, I mean? Oh, I don't know. A good deal, I expect.
I don't believe I should mind so very much.
You see, we could never in our whole lives be any happier than we are now.
Could we?
Sweetheart.
- Are all honeymoons like this?
- Exactly.
Oh, Edward. It's rather disheartening, isn't it?
I do so want this to be unique. It is, for us. Did you ever think when we were children,
- going to the pantomime and the zoo...
- That we should end up by getting married?
- Mm-hmmm.
- Of course I didn't.
You were a horrible child.
Well, so were you. And so was Joey. Vile.
Yet we all liked each other, really. Dear Joey.
He's passing gallantly through the chorus girl phase now, isn't he? Mm.
Gallantly but not quickly.
- Well, darling, you took your time over it.
- Now, Edith. Didn't you?
Light of my life, shut up.
You'd be awfully cross if I'd had affairs.
- If you'd what?
- Had affairs. Love affairs before you.
- You didn't. - Hundreds. You liar.
I rather wish I had sometimes.
Perhaps then I should have learned some tricks to hold you with when you begin to get tired of me.
I shall never do that, tricks or no tricks.
Oh, yes, you will one day.
People always do.
This complete loveliness will fade, and we shall forget what it was like.
- Edith, don't. - Oh, it's bound to.
Just a few years and the gilt wears off the gingerbread.
Darling, answer me one thing truthfully.
Have you ever seen gingerbread with gilt on it?
- Oh, fool! - Then the whole argument is disposed of.
Anyway, look at Father and Mother.
They're perfectly happy and always have been.
Oh, yes, but they had a better chance in the beginning.
Things weren't changing so swiftly, and life wasn't so restless.
How long do you give us?
I don't know.
Oh, and, Edward, I don't care.
This is our moment, complete and heavenly.
I'm not afraid of anything.
This is our own, forever.
Oh, dear.
It'll be 10:00 before we get to London.
If we're held up by many more troop trains, it'll be tomorrow morning.
- Oh, Joey. - Or next week.
May I see your paper, Robert?
Hmm? Oh, of course, my dear.
Darling, what's the matter? Can I help you?
- No, it's all right. - Shall I get a taxi, Father?
- Yes, go ahead, Joey. - All right.
Oh, here they are. Hello, Charlie.
- Mum, where shall I put these bags?
- Oh, put them anywhere. All right. Oh, really, why does one ever go abroad?
It's misery when you're away, and you come back to this sort of thing.
I'm absolutely dead beat.
No servants, no food in the house, no nothing.
Oh! I thought that awful journey was never going to end. Oh!
Oh, it was awful, wasn't it?
Oh! Come on, Margaret. Help me with these abominable things.
Mm-hmm.
What fools we were to start back without making sure of the servants.
Well, anyway, it's much better to be here in London. If anything is going to happen...
It's going to happen, all right.
This is a lark, isn't it?
I put the bags up...
- Hello. Spring cleaning?
- Where's your father?
Oh, groping about in the cellar, like an angry old beetle.
- He wants a drink. - Hear!
Hear! So do I.
Well, I'd better go and see if I can find some biscuits or something.
- Cigarette? - Oh, thank you, Joe.
- Pretty thrilling, isn't it?
- Just a bit too thrilling, my dear.
Oh, rot, Aunt Margaret.
It's absolutely marvelous.
Passing all those supply trains and guns.
Being pushed aside to make way for the troops.
The crowds waiting for something to happen.
Oh, it was wonderful.
Jane's howling for you in the kitchen, Margaret.
Oh, all right.
Well, I can't find anything but Hock.
We'll have to drink to Germany's downfall in their own damn wine.
- I rather like Germans.
Don't you, Father? - Enormously. Give me a hand, Joey.
If there is a war, how long do you think it'll last?
Oh, three months at the outside.
- We shall win.
- We shall win.
Perhaps it'll last six months.
Economically impossible.
Have you any idea what a war costs?
- Hell of a lot, I suppose.
- Hell of a lot. The Germans can afford it even less than we can.
- Then there's Russia. - Good ol' Russia.
And France, Italy and America.
Japan, China, Nicaragua, Guatemala. Oh, why, we've got 'em licked before we start.
- Don't be silly, Joey. - Sorry.
What's the time?
Nearly 12:00. Is that right?
Well, it oughta be. Hasn't varied a minute in the past 10 years.
It's all happening now.
Short of a miracle, it's all happened.
Are you glad you left the army, or not?
Absolutely delighted.
- Will you go back again? - I expect so.
- How will you feel about that? - Absolutely delighted. I suppose I ought to do something about it, too.
- You want to?
- Terribly.
Why?
I don't know.
I wish...
I wish Edward hadn't been drowned.
We could have started off together.
Don't be too impulsive and patriotic and dashing, Joey.
Think of your mother. Think of me, too.
Found some potted meat and biscuits and Worcester sauce and... War declared official!
We are at war! War declared official!
War declared official!
My dears, we're at war with Germany. No. Listen.
Listen.
It's very hot, isn't it? Don't look sad, Mum.
It won't last long.
Father says it can't possibly. And it's terribly exciting. I feel rather tired.
Here, Mum, dear, have a nice sozzle.
We all oughta get drunk, really, and go roaring about the streets.
Edward missed this anyhow.
At least he died when he was happy...
Before the world broke over his head.
Jane darling, we've had wars before without the world breaking.
My world isn't very big.
Drink to the war then. I'm not going to. I can't!
Rule Britannia! Send us victorious, happy and glorious.
Drink, Joey.
You're only a baby still, but you're old enough for war.
Drink as the Germans are doing tonight.
To victory and defeat and stupid tragic sorrow. But don't ask me to do it, please!
Those awful recruiting songs again.
You can't get away from them anywhere in London.
Oh, they give me rather a thrill.
The girls give me a thrill.
I'll bet that little dark one sung her share of fellas into the war.
By George, I'm excited.
Finally leave off to France Saturday. Marvelous.
Marvelously marvelous.
Oh, good Lord, Ainger, do you mean to say you don't want to get back'?
Seriously, don't you feel pretty marvelous?
I feel pretty thirsty.
Well, that's easily remedied.
Uh, waiter.
- Uh, some more wine, please.
- Ah. Oh, it's a bit of luck, the war coming when it did.
I was properly fed up at Oxford.
Oxford? I was just starting in an accountant's office.
Well, you'll probably finish up under the poppies in Flanders.
Drink up and have another.
My hat, that girl can dance.
- Who is she'?
- A kid by the name of Fanny Bridges.
- Fanny Bridges?
- Yes. Know her?
- Excuse me, old chaps.
- It's all right. Come on. Drink up.
I... Now, don't be afraid. I say, you're marvelous.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing?
- I was waiting for you. - Waiting? You don't mean to say you've been here all this time while I...
Oh, no, no.
I mean, as a matter of fact...
I say, you are marvelous. - Who are you?
- One of your oldest friends.
Oh, what a lie. I've never seen you before in my life. - Oh, but you have.
- Oh, but I haven't. Oh, really you have.
We lived under the same roof for years.
Oh, I'm sure this is a very good joke, but I'm awfully busy and...
- My name's Joey. - Oh, how interesting.
And I have a dog called Towser. Now, do you mind going?
'Cause I have to finish dressing.
But you don't remember anyone called Joey when you were a little girl?
Little girl?
You're not Joey Marryot?
Fanny!
Isn't it marvelous?
Take cover! Take cover! Take cover!
- Did you hear that? - Yes.
Air raid.
Take cover in the basement.
Well, that's all very well, but where is the basement?
Oh, never mind the basement. Let's go up on the roof.
Oh, that's that. I can't see a thing.
Oh, curse the dark. I'm smashing the room to bits.
What on earth have I got hold of? Feels like a tray of squashed bananas.
Thanks. That's my makeup box. Here, we're missing all the fun.
Catch hold of my hand. - That's better. - This way.
Now, don't fall over. Oh, dear. I can't see a thing.
Oh. There it is.
Oh, Joey, isn't it thrilling? Marvelous.
Yes, it's pretty hard at times...
All the muck and filth.
And it's a bit weird when you find yourself the only surviving officer who went out with the battalion.
'Course it may be sort of the law of averages, to make up to Mother for Edward going down on the Titanic.
Or perhaps I'm just lucky.
Anyway, what's the good of talking?
Gotta go back tonight.
Just one last twinkle.
Oh, my darling, don't give me any more. I shall be tight.
You don't want me to fall down during my first number, do you?
Fun, having dinner here, wasn't it?
Lovely fun, darling. Curtain's up, please.
Oh, heavens. I'm on in five minutes.
Will you really write to me tonight? Of course I will.
I promised.
Well, you'll be smothered with people after the show, and you won't have time.
I'll write you in the first interval and send Maggie out to post it.
Dear old Maggie. Darling.
In about one minute, we've got to say good-bye.
Flowers, miss. Oh, give them to Maggie and tell her to put them in water.
Yes, miss.
Don't go yet, Joey. Stay till my first act.
Wait. Can't. I promised to go home.
Mother's waiting for me.
- Do stay, darling. - I can't. Really, I can't.
I'm sorry. Of course you can't. So I'll give it to you now.
What?
Just a little something I had made for you.
With my love.
Oh, how marvelous.
Oh, it's nothing. Just a reminder of all the fun we've had.
You're a darling.
Oh, but you've missed the whole point.
It opens. Look.
I'll keep it...
Forever and ever... And ever.
Oh, darling, I almost wish I didn't love you quite so terribly.
It makes going back just a bit too thick somehow.
I shall miss you... Dreadfully. Miss Bridges, please.
Heavens, that's my call.
It has been fun, hasn't it?
Heavenly.
And you don't regret it?
Any of it?
Not a moment. Oh, how wonderful you are.
Do you really love me?
Deep down inside, I mean.
Of course, I do.
Enough to marry me?
Yes, but I wouldn't. - Oh, why not?
- Too difficult.
Besides, we shouldn't be happy married.
- And your mother wouldn't like it. - She'd be all right.
Let's not talk about it now.
Let's wait until you come back.
- Oh, no. - No.
No, not now, dear.
I see. Miss Bridges, please!
Listen, Joey. I love you, and you love me.
And I've got to go now. I'm late. And you've got to go, too.
But I'm not going to say good-bye. We've had fun, grand fun.
And I don't want you to forget me.
That's why I gave you the locket.
Keep it close to you, Joey.
Darling Joey.
Miss Bridges, you're keeping the stage.
Not much time for good-byes.
- I'm glad, really.
Aren't you?
- Awfully. - I never know what to say.
- I'm almost hardened.
This has happened so often.
Dearest Mum, you are wonderful.
You never make a fuss.
Don't be too sweet to me, Joey.
I don't want to behave badly.
You? You couldn't behave badly.
Oh, how funny.
Robert said that to me years and years ago.
'Twas the Boer War then.
This is all so different. Good-bye, dear.
Good-bye, darling.
Take care of yourself. Try to see your father on the way.
- Yes, if I can. Good-bye. - Good-bye.
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.
- First time out?
- Yes, marvelous, isn't it?
- Marvelously marvelous.
- Aren't you glad to be going back?
Terribly.
I thought it was all going to finish before I was old enough to go out.
So did I, once.
- Sorry, I gotta see the RTO. - RTO? What's that?
Railway Transport Officer. Don't you know anything?
- Excuse me, sir. - Yes. What is it?
Returning from leave. First Greenjackets.
Staff Sergeant, see about this officer's train, will you?
Yes, sir.
May I speak to you a moment?
I'm fearfully busy. Won't the staff sergeant do?
I'm afraid not, Father. What the...
How'd you know I was here?
- Found out at the base.
- Oh, you young devil.
How's Mother?
- Splendid.
- Just about killing herself, I suppose, with war work and all that.
She's pretty wonderful.
You look pretty tired, too, sir.
Well, we're moving troops very rapidly. Enemy's on the run.
- What did you do with your leave?
- Oh, I don't know. Lots of things.
- I saw Aunt Margaret.
- Yes. Couldn't dodge it, I suppose?
- How is she?
- She's all right.
- When do you go on leave, sir?
- Probably never again. Good Lord, why?
Because they're talking about an armistice.
- No.
- Fact.
We may all be home in a few weeks.
Train for First Greenjackets, number one platform, five minutes, sir.
Five minutes? I gotta collect my kit.
- Good-bye, Dad. - Good-bye.
Good of you to look me up, Joey.
Good-bye.
General Staff Home Command speaking.
"An armistice has been signed and hostilities will cease today
"at 11:00 ack-emma.
"At 11:00 precisely, the Hyde Park battery will fire a salute of 21 guns.
"And the officer in charge of mortars will let off a salvo of maroons.
"Written orders will follow.
"Officers will now proceed to synchronize watches."
Are you ready?
Her ladyship will not keep you a moment, madam. Much obliged, I'm sure.
Why, Ellen.
My maid said, "Mrs. Bridges." it never occurred to me that it was you.
Yes, I just thought I'd call.
It's rather important, as a matter of fact.
Do sit down.
I'm delighted to see you again. Thank you.
- How's Fanny?
- Oh, very well. She's in Over the Moon now, you know.
It's about her I've come to see you, really.
Oh. Well?
Well, it's rather difficult.
Oh, what's the matter?
About her and Master...
Her and Joe.
- Joe'?
- Yes, Joe. They've been having a...
Well, to put it frankly, if you know what I mean...
They've been having an affair.
His last two leaves he's spent a lot of time with her.
I wouldn't have come to see you about it at all, only...
Well, I think Fanny's very upset about it.
Now that the war is over and he'll be coming home, I thought that... - What did you think?
- I thought they ought to get married.
Does she want to marry him?
No, not exactly.
That is...
Oh, well, I haven't talked about it to her.
She doesn't know I know. - How do you know?
- Found a letter from him.
- And you read it?
- Yes. I've got it here. - I brought it with me.
- I don't wish to see it, thank you.
Oh, but I only brought it because I thought you might...
Tell me, is Fanny in any sort of trouble?
Oh, no, nothing like that.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
I think we'd better wait until Joe comes home. Then they can decide.
Well. I'm sure I didn't wish to upset you.
I'm not in the least upset.
But it's been on my mind. It's been worrying me to death.
I think you should have spoken to your daughter before you came to see me.
I never interfere with my son's affairs.
I'm sure I'm ever so sorry.
Please, don't let's discuss it any further.
Good-bye, Ellen.
Oh, I suppose you imagine that my daughter isn't good enough to marry your son.
Well, if that's the case, I can assure you you're very much mistaken.
Fanny's received everywhere.
She knows all the best people.
How nice for her. I wish I did.
Things aren't what they used to be, you know. - No, it's all changing'.
- Yes, I see it is.
But Fanny's at the top of her tree now.
She's having the most wonderful offers.
- Oh, Ellen! - What is it?
I'm so very, very sorry.
I don't know what you mean.
Oh, yes, you do. Inside, you must.
Something seems to have gone out of all of us, and I...
I'm not sure that I like what's left.
Good-bye, Ellen.
I don't know why you should talk like that.
Some of us have got on in their world, and some of us haven't.
I said, "Good-bye, Ellen."
Yes, what is it?
It's all over, milady.
The maroons are going off.
Excuse me.
There's no answer.
What is it? What's happened?
You needn't worry about Fanny and Joe.
He won't be able to come back. He's...
Dead.
Oh, your ladyship.
Oh, milady.
Why are we here in Geneva?
To bear witness to the truth that if the world war is to be crowned by peace, the world must disarm.
All efforts to appoint this paramount... You talk of disarmament, but where is it?
What defense does it offer?
But this poison gas gives us security.
What's all this talk about balancing the budget?
The whole world's broke. We're all broke.
The whole thing is a heartless mockery.
After centuries of investigation, it comes to this.
God is a superstition too crude to impose upon a child.
We abandon the primitive yearning of a savage for an object of worship
- and focus instead...
- We are all free to join the scramble for power and riches, and to sell our beliefs to buy success.
But each of us must one day face an awful question that is echoing down through the ages.
What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world?
Introducing Miss Fanny Bridges and her new song hit.
But, Jane dear, I like jazz.
I don't see the sense in sitting, waiting for the grave.
Oh, I'm not waiting for anything. I have a perfectly good time.
I go to the opera. I go to theaters.
I go to the zoo.
So far, I must say, I found the zoo infinitely the most entertaining. Really, Jane dear, you're quite hopeless.
Well, I refuse to be jostled about it.
All this jazz and whizzing about.
No wonder you're always in the clutches of a new doctor. Now, dear, I don't think it's quite fair to say that.
He's the most wonderful man I've ever met.
And he has the most marvelous touch.
He's completely cured me.
Cured you of what, darling?
Oh, of my ailment.
Well, I'm perfectly comfortable where I am...
Without taking cures for ailments I haven't got.
Yes, but how do you know you haven't got any ailments?
Because I'm sane and active and as strong as a horse.
So is Robert. - It's nearly time, milady.
- Oh, put it on the coffee table. Good heavens!
I must fly.
I wouldn't interfere with your little ritual for the world.
Oh, my dear, you wouldn't interfere.
- You're an old friend.
- Oh, that's very sweet of you, Jane dear. All the same, I must go.
Why, I'm late as it is.
- Oh, going already, Margaret?
- Yes, Robert.
Why, I promised to be at the embassy at half past 11:00.
And now don't forget that you're both dining with me on Tuesday.
Oh, my dear, how can we, if you're going to Paris on Monday?
Oh, but I shall be flying back in the afternoon.
Flying?
She would. Now, Robert, don't bother to come down.
- Nonsense.
Of course I will.
- No, no, no, I insist.
- Now, I can easily let myself out.
- Very well.
And a happy New Year to you.
- Bless you both. - Good night, dear.
The same to you.
Twice over.
Well, Robert, here we go again.
One more year behind us.
One more year before us. - Do you mind? - No.
Everything passes, even time.
That means you do.
And you don't?
I still believe in the future.
Ah, that's your strength, my dear.
I believe in the future, too, but not quite in the same way.
It's been quite an adventure, our life together.
A great adventure, Robert.
Anxious sometimes and sad.
Sometimes unbelievably happy.
But thank God, never dull or sordid.
And most of it has come to us in this house...
- In this very room. - Yes.
Sometimes I've almost hated it.
- You wouldn't move?
- Oh, my dear, of course not.
Well, we might have some new curtains, of course.
- We have, dear. - Hmm?
Have we?
Oh, so we have. I never noticed.
- They've only been up a week. - Oh! Dear Robert.
In one minute, it will be 1933.
Well, Robert, what toast have you in mind for tonight?
- Something gay and original, I hope.
- No, just the future. Our old friend, the future... The future of England.
But first of all, my dear...
I drink to you.
And I drink to you, Robert.
Loyal and loving, always.
Now, let's couple the future of England with the past of England...
The glories, the victories, the triumphs that are over.
And the sorrows that are over, too.
Let us drink to our sons who made part of the pattern.
And to our hearts that died with them.
Let us drink to the spirit of gallantry and courage that made a strange heaven out of unbelievable hell.
And let us drink to the hope that one day this country of ours, which we love so much, will find dignity and greatness and peace again.
Dignity... Greatness and peace.
En voiture!
- Bonjour. - Bonjour.
Bonjour!
Alors, vous trouvez que ça me ressemble?
Tout à fait.
- J'ai I'air aussi bête que ça? - J'en ai peur.
Voyons, Mademoiselle, regardez ce nez!
C'est le vôtre. J'y peux rien.
Enfin, passons pour moi.
Mais alors, lui.
Vous I'avez bien arrangé.
Mais ce n'est pas sa tête, ce n'est pas son crâne.
D'où je suis, c'est tout à fait ça!
Son maxillaire supérieur n'est pas aussi proéminent.
Au contraire, c'est ce qui ressort le plus.
- Et le menton? - Exactement le sien!
- Trop accentué! - Je le vois comme ça.
Et puis comprenez, monsieur, que ceci est une caricature... et dites-vous bien que le but d'un dessin ou d'une peinture... n'est pas de reproduire une vulgaire photographie... mais de faire ressortir les caractéristiques d'un faciès... vues selon la personnalité de l'artiste, même en les exagérant.
Oh, nuts!
Well, baby, the name is Curtis.
- May I present Thomas B. Chambers. - My name is Gilda Farrell.
- Coming back to the subject of art - - Are you a painter?
- Yes. - What did you say your name was?
- Curtis. - George Curtis?
Yes.
You exhibited a painting at the Shale Galleries.
- True. - Let me see.
- Oh, Lady Godiva, wasn't it? - Did you like it?
I saw it with a friend of mine. She loved it.
We haven't spoken since.
I, uh -
I wouldn't consider her one of your greatest admirers.
- Are you a painter too? - Oh, no, no. Not me.
I'm a playwright.
I write unproduced plays. And very good of that kind.
- Why didn't you like my picture? - It's smart-aleck.
You're wisecracking with paint.
It simply creaks with originality.
Lady Godiva riding a bicycle!
I know what she means.
A bicycle seat is a little hard on Lady Godiva's historical background.
Shut up!
I see.
Lady Godiva doesn't belong on a bicycle... but it's okay to put Napoleon... in a Kaplan and McGuire non-wrinkling, 2.50 union suit.
Quite right. That's not history.
And if I may say so, they, uh - they do wrinkle.
I'm a commercial artist.
I'm being paid for telling the world that if Napoleon were alive today... he would wear Kaplan and McGuire's 2.50, non-wrinkling underwear.
Pure hooey.
You're wasting your time painting for art galleries.
You should get in contact with some bicycle manufacturer.
You'd clean up.
I'll give you a good slogan:
"Join Lady Godiva on our tandem."
Don't say "nuts." Not to a lady.
- Hurry up, Gilda! - Shake a leg!
It's amazing how a few insults can bring people together in three hours.
It was certainly good to hear all the names you called me.
I haven't heard 'em since I left Father and Mother.
What we want to know is, do you like us better than Kaplan and McGuire?
Let me tell you, Curtis and Chambers deliver the goods.
En voiture!
En voiture!
- Max! - Gilda! Darling!
I don't think it's Kaplan.
I doubt if it's McGuire.
And it's certainly not Napoleon.
- Take a letter! - Yes, sir.
My dear Mr. Thomas B. Chambers.
Uh, cross that out.
Mr. Chambers.
Comma. Paragraph.
I am writing you in regard to your undesirable attentions to Miss Gilda Farrell.
Hello. Yes.
No, no, no, that won't do at all.
I want the copy to read exactly as I laid it out.
"The real aristocrat surrenders to Murphy Hold 'Em Up Suspenders."
And put "Hold 'Em Up" in a brighter color.
A-And listen, put that French touch in the suspenders.
Where was I?
Undesirable attention to Miss Gilda Farrell.
I'm afraid, Bassington, that you are wrong.
I'm afraid, Bassington, that you are wr -
I'm afraid, Bassington... that you are right... but nonetheless boring.
Very good.
Very good.
Bassington curls his lips foolishly... and crosses to left.
Bassington speaks:
There's only one thing I have to say to you.
What could he say?
There's only one thing I have to say to you.
Come in, come in.
There's only one thing I have to say to you.
Ah, Plunkett, Incorporated!
Well, welcome to Bohemia, sir.
- How do you do? - Why, I'm getting on, sir, in my modest way.
- And you? - I'm well, thank you.
You're looking splendid.
That's a fetching tie, Mr. Plunkett. And these spats - very exciting.
What an ensemble?
But personally, I don't like derbies.
They give a man that undertaker look.
My dear Mr. Chambers, I have come here to speak to you man to man.
My favorite type of conversation.
I wish to broach a rather delicate subject.
Oh, now, don't let's be delicate, Mr. Plunkett. Let's be crude and objectionable, both of us.
One of the greatest handicaps to civilization, and I may say to progress... is the fact that people speak with ribbons on their tongues.
Delicacy, as the philosophers point out... is the, uh, banana peel under the feet of truth.
And, uh, if you've come up here to raise a fuss about Gilda... this derby is a thing of the past.
Mr. Chambers, I -
Mr. Chambers, I don't wish you to misunderstand me.
I am not Miss Farrell's husband, nor her fiancé in any shape, form or manner.
Hmm. I see. Her devoted friend.
- Yes. For five years. - Mm-hmm.
- Her guide, I take it, and counselor. - Yes.
- Her protector. - Exactly.
Mm-hmm. In other words, Mr. Plunkett, you, uh - you never got to first base.
Yes -
- I'll overlook that insult. - Thank you.
Will you be seated?
Mr. Chambers, your attentions to Gilda are undesirable.
- Has she been complaining? - No.
Well, good, good. I'm very busy, Mr. Plunkett.
I, uh - I'm creating.
Mr. Chambers, there's only one thing I have to say to you.
- Do you know what it is? - Yes.
Immorality may be fun... but it isn't fun enough to take the place of 100% virtue and three square meals a day.
Now, wait a minute.
Immorality may be fun -
But it isn't fun enough to take the place -
- Of 100% virtue - - And three square meals a day.
- Superb! - Furthermore -
Ah-ah!
Not another word!
Th-That's a curtain.
Three square meals a day... and Bassington exits.
Mr. Chambers -
Listen to me, Plunkett, Incorporated.
I'm in love with Gilda. I adore her. I'm quite insane about her.
I love you, Gilda.
Oh, that's sweet to hear.
Gilda, sometimes I wonder what I see in you.
You don't appreciate me, and you know nothing about art.
Maybe you love me because I'm an imbecile.
It must be something like that.
I really love you.
I'm amazed at myself.
It's sincere. That's what gets my goat.
Gilda.
I'm very fond of you.
Oh. You're fond of me, huh?
I don't like that.
I know what's the trouble.
I swear I'll break his neck!
Gilda, you're mine! Tell him to get out of your life and stay out or I'll cut him to bits!
- Who? - That pal of yours, Max Plunkett.
Well, what's the verdict?
Are you jealous?
No. No, I'm not jealous.
The whole point is that I just don't want any competition.
It belittles me in my own eyes. It - It interferes with my work.
I - I can't paint when I'm worried.
All right. I'll tell Max.
See that you do. Understand?
Yes, sir.
Gilda.
Now please go. I'll see you tomorrow.
Tomorrow my life begins!
- Hello, Mr. Plunkett. - Hello.
Oh! Mr. Curtis.
- How are you? - I'm well, thank you.
- Good night, Mr. Plunkett. - Uh, just a minute.
What are you doing here?
- At the moment I am leaving. - I mean, you've seen Miss Farrell?
Yes, I've seen Gilda.
- Well! - She's expecting you.
She has some news for you.
Mr. Curtis, I wish to, uh, broach a rather delicate matter.
It concerns Gilda.
Sit down.
Shoot!
Mr. Curtis... what is your annual income, in round figures?
In round figures... zero.
- May I ask what you live on? - Nothing.
I survive by miracles.
Mr. Curtis, I must ask you man to man to discontinue your attentions to Gilda.
Now you're making very unbecoming faces, Mr. Plunkett.
- She doesn't need you. - Guess again!
Mr. Curtis, there's only one thing I have to say to you.
Immorality may be fun, but it isn't fun enough to take the place of 100% virtue... and three square meals a day.
So!
This is the way you talk to a man who wears Kaplan and McGuire union suits.
Mr. Plunkett, I shall report you to your clients immediately.
Good night, sir.
- Yesterday it was Tom. - Yes?
- Today it's George. - Yes?
Okay.
Hoodlums.
Artistic bums.
Both of 'em put together aren't worth a dime.
Gilda, no one knows better than you how unselfish I've been... in all matters pertaining to you.
- You've been nice. - I've been marvelous.
No, just nice.
Gilda, I've been your friend for five years -
And I want you to remain my friend for the next 50 years, so please shut up.
Max, have you ever been in love?
This is no time to answer that.
Have you ever felt your brain catch fire... and a curious, dreadful thing go right through your body... down, down to your very toes... and leave you with your ears ringing?
That's abnormal.
Well, that's how I felt just before you came in.
Yes? How'd you feel yesterday after your promenade with Tom?
Just the opposite.
It started in my very toes and came up, up, up very slowly... until my brain caught fire.
But the ringing in the ears was the same.
Hello.
Hello.
Did you go for the laundry?
Hardly.
Why not?
Two cans of sardines, five francs.
Madame Poperino, blackmail, seven francs 50.
- No laundry. - That's fine.
I haven't got a clean shirt to my name.
Clean shirt?
What's up, a romance?
I'm not talking about pajamas.
I'm talking about a clean shirt.
I don't want to go around looking like a rag picker.
I'm talking about a white shirt, a shirt without a spot, without any holes... that won't fall apart when you unbutton your coat.
How old is the laundress?
Oh, she's about 45.
A young 45?
Oh, I don't know.
She goes barefoot.
She's, uh, rather plump, a little soapy... but a very interesting mustache.
Very charming, very charming. Not my type.
Mustache or no mustache, I need a clean shirt for tomorrow.
End of Act One.
Curtain.
Don't read it. I know it by heart.
You remember where Bassington has found out that Edgar was the man on the fire escape?
- All right, shoot! - "There's a pause."
- "Edgar smiles maddeningly." - Go on, go on!
"Bassington plays with his beard in order to cover his emotion."
Edgar speaks.
'I'm afraid, Bassington, that you are right, but nonetheless boring.'
Bassington studies his fingernails like a man of the world, crosses to left.
Edgar continues strumming his mandolin.
Bassington, resuming with his beard -
'I have only one thing to say to you.
Immortality may be fun... but it's not fun enough to take the place of 100% virtue... and three square meals a day."'
What's the matter?
- So! Double-crossing me, huh? - What are you buzzing about?
You didn't write that speech alone, and I know where you got it!
- Well, if you think - - And don't try to lie out of it!
He was in here - Mr. Plunkett.
And it isn't difficult to guess why he was here either.
So you've been making love to Gilda.
- Now, listen, if you - - I know!
"100% virtue and three square meals a day!"
Wait a minute.
So you've heard that speech before!
Where did you hear that speech before?
Oh, I see.
Clean shirt, eh?
- So he caught you with Gilda. - It's a lie! He didn't catch me.
Very pretty work. True blue George.
Look who's talking about true blue! I oughta bust you right in that ugly pan of yours!
Let's behave like civilized people.
It's quite apparent beyond any question... that you behaved in this matter as a rather common, ordinary rat.
I'm leaving.
Where's my suitcase?
Or have you sold it to somebody?
This is a little silly, after 11 years of friendship.
You should have considered that earlier!
Do you mind a personal question?
Not at all.
Are you pretty hard hit?
That's none of your business.
- And you? - Likewise.
What a pity we had to fall in love with the same girl.
Charming, isn't she?
Rather.
Nice eyes.
Of a sort.
Well, I guess we're through.
Looks like it.
Curious to have a little bit of feminine fluff breaking up our friendship.
Sad.
Quite a dilemma.
I wonder if she's worth it.
I wonder.
In fact, I doubt it.
There's only one thing we know about her - she's full of deceit.
- She's trying to hang it on both of us. - We shouldn't let her get away with it.
- She's a troublemaker. - We ought to put our foot down.
You're right. We oughtn't to let her break it up.
I've been listening to these half-witted dramas of yours for 11 years!
Yes, and I've grown cockeyed looking at those humpty-dumpty pictures of yours.
And we should give up all this on account of some girl we met on a train?
- Third class! - No woman's worth it.
Absolutely not.
No more clean shirts?
- We ignore her, 50-50. - Fine.
- Sacrifice helps an artist. - Exactly!
The sorrows of life are the joys of art.
- I don't think we ought to discuss her anymore. - Right.
If, uh, the occasion arises which requires our mentioning her at all... we'll refer to her as, uh, Miss Farrell.
- It'll make the whole thing more impersonal. - Exactly.
Hey, George, did you really sell my suitcase?
Yeah.
Okay.
Monsieur Chambers ou Monsieur Curtis. Au téléphone!
Telephone?
Well, um - Oh. Answer it if you wish.
Go ahead. I trust you.
Oh, thanks.
- Merci beaucoup. - De rien.
Hello?
Yes?
Well, uh, just a second.
It's, uh - It's Miss Farrell.
What do you want, Gilda?
I beg your pardon.
I see.
I-I see.
Well, just a second, please.
- She wants to come up tomorrow. - Tell her absolutely no.
Okay.
Uh, well -
Uh, well, hold the wire.
Miss Farrell's a little late.
It hardly matters.
I think we ought to be polite.
I'm going to assume a very nonchalant attitude.
Don't forget. Nonchalant.
Vous êtes bien Monsieur Curtis et Monsieur Chambers?
Oui.
Je les ai trouvés. Ils habitent ici.
- Au cinquième. - Merci bien.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
How do you do?
Tommy, you're such a child.
I'm so nervous.
Couldn't we all be a little bit more nonchalant?
I came here to make a confession - a confession hard to make at 11:00 in the morning.
George.
Yes, please?
Sit down here.
Well -
- Shall I leave the room? - No, please!
George. Dear George.
When I let you make love to me yesterday, I didn't tell you something.
I didn't tell you that the day before, Tom and I had -
Did he tell you?
No.
- Thank you, Tommy. - You're very welcome.
George, promise me you won't start smashing furniture.
I'm more than fond of Tommy.
- I'm sorry, old man. - Quite all right.
- Thank you. - Okay!
But -
Tom, when we were in the park - Do you remember?
- Very well. - I didn't tell you.
That morning I made a date with George for the next evening in my house... and I didn't call it off.
- And I want to be truthful. I - - Oh, I see.
In other words, you're very fond of George.
More than fond.
A thing happened to me that usually happens to men.
You see, a man can meet two, three, or even four women... and fall in love with all of them... and then, by a process of, uh, interesting elimination... he's able to decide which one he prefers.
But a woman must decide purely on instinct, guesswork, if she wants to be considered nice.
Oh, it's quite all right for her to try on a hundred hats before she picks one out, but -
Very fine. But which chapeau do you want, madam?
Both.
You see, George, you're sort of like a ragged straw hat... with a very soft lining.
A little bit out of shape... very dashing to look at... and very comfortable to wear.
And you, Tom.
Chic, piquant, perched over one eye... and has to be watched on windy days.
And both so becoming.
Oh, I'm the most unhappy woman in the world!
Poor girl. She's in rather a tough spot.
George.
Dear George, there's no use pretending you could make me forget Tom.
- I'd miss him. - You would not.
But for the sake of argument, okay.
And, Tom, if I went with you up hill and down dale... he would haunt me like a bogeyman.
It's a pitiful situation.
Well, if it'll make you happy, I'm willing to step out.
Never mind the grandstand gesture! I know how you'd step out - with a club.
On the other hand, if you feel that you can't get along without her... it wouldn't be the first sacrifice I've made for you.
What sacrifice? What have you ever done for me?
Look who's talking! Little Rollo!
Why, you're the most self-centered, egotistical, double-crosser I ever knew!
- Now, listen, if I - - Shh! There you have it.
You hate him, he hates you, and you both end up by hating me.
Boys, let's sit down.
Now let's talk it over from every angle without any excitement... like a disarmament conference.
Bonsoir, messieurs. Qu'est-ce que ces messieurs désirent pour dà(Registered Trademark)ner?
Le pain de veau est délicieux.
Les cà´telettes de mouton sont fraà(Registered Trademark)chement cuites, et les pieds de cochon sont merveilleux.
Merveilleux!
Très piquants!
Uh, trois frankfurters.
Ah, bon. Très bien, messieurs, tout de suite.
Well? What do you think?
I think it can be worked out, providing -
Yes, you're right.
"Providing."
- Voila, messieurs. - Merci.
Merci bien, messieurs.
Well, boys, it's the only thing we can do. Let's forget sex.
Okay. Agreed.
- It may be a bit difficult in the beginning. - But it can be worked out.
- Oh, it'll be grand! - Save lots of time.
And confusion.
We're going to concentrate on work.
Your work. My work doesn't count.
I think both you boys have a great deal of talent, but too much ego.
You spend one day working and a whole month bragging.
Gentlemen, there are going to be a few changes.
I'm going to jump up and down on your ego.
I'm going to criticize your work with a baseball bat.
I'm going to tell you every day how bad your stuff is until you get something good... and if it's good, I'm going to tell you it's rotten till you get something better.
I'm going to be a mother of the arts.
No sex.
- Uh-huh. - Oh, no.
It's a gentleman's agreement.
Rotten, eh?
Listen, my dear girl, when it comes to playwriting, you don't know your - your dear little elbow from a barrel of flour.
The third act is marvelous. I've never written anything better.
It's rotten.
Fortunately, I know that intellectually you're still in rompers.
You should have realized by now, my dear, that I hate stupidity masquerading as criticism.
Rotten.
So I've had enough of that. You're ruining me. You're ruining my work.
You're just being cheap and malicious.
Rotten.
Very well. It's the last time you're going to tell me that.
Good-bye, my dear.
- It was a complete flop in London. - I'm sorry, but I don't ag -
- I beg your pardon. - Forgive me for entering unannounced.
- Mr. Douglas is very busy. - So they were kind enough to tell me downstairs.
- Mr. Douglas? - Yes?
Mr. Douglas, I consider you the greatest theatrical producer in London.
- I - - In fact, in the world.
My dear young lady, what precisely do you want?
Well, I've read your list of productions for the next London season.
- Yes? - They're very bad.
But believe me, there's no need for you to despair.
The situation isn't entirely black, Mr. Douglas.
Have you ever heard of a playwright called Thomas Chambers?
No, never!
You've never read a play called Good Night, Bassington?
Heavens, no! Never!
Well, here it is. Read it. I'm sure you'll adore it.
It's a woman's play.
Good-bye.
Those faking art dealers!
Peanut brains!
Parasites!
- Maybe he's right. Maybe they are - - No, they are not!
- I don't know, Gilda. - Well, I know. Those paintings are great.
- And don't let anybody tell you they aren't. - Three of them have.
Well, they're all fools. They'll be breaking their necks to get hold of your work.
- Maybe when I'm dead. - Stop it!
If you can't believe in yourself, believe in me.
I'm no good. It's getting obvious.
George, you're a fine painter. You're an artist. You're going to be one of the great ones.
And if you lie down in the middle of the road, I'll hate you!
Well, friends... the gentleman addressing you... is none other than the illustrious Mr. Thomas B. Chambers... the new dramatic thunderbolt of the London theater.
Good Night, Bassington... has been accepted.
- You don't mean it! - Did you sign the contract?
In letters of fire.
One hundred pounds advance.
It's colossal!
- The Bank of England. - Uh-huh.
- That's a good bank, huh? - It's the best!
By the way, Gilda, I, uh -
I neglected to mention...
I'm supposed to go to London.
- To London? - Tonight.
Uh, Mr. Douglas seems to think that I might be of great help during rehearsals.
You know, half the play depends on someone -
Bringing out its brittle quality. Oh, yes.
What do you think? Should I go?
Oh, well, you could do a lot in London, no doubt about that.
And it would help the publicity, of course.
But on the other hand if you stayed here, you could finish your new play.
And yet you might make some valuable connections in London.
But I'm just wondering if you could do as good work in the midst of all that hullabaloo... as you could if you stayed here.
- Oh, well, Tom, I - - Aw, Gilda.
I couldn't do good work anywhere without you, and you know it.
And if there should be any curtain calls after that third act, how could I take the bows alone?
You're nice, Tom.
I'm not going.
Well, drop me a line from London, old boy, will you?
- Righto! - Right!
Step a little more forward, Mr. Chambers.
That's it. Smile, please.
- Take off your hat, Mr. Douglas. - Oh!
That's it. Hold it!
Well, in five weeks you'll be taking the same train... and the three of us'll sit in the royal box at the opening.
En voiture!
En voiture!
- Good-bye, boy. - Good-bye, pal.
Good-bye, Gilda.
Keep that old typewriter of mine booted and spurred.
I will.
So long.
You've had enough today.
Please.
Okay, teacher.
I'll have to sew a button on there.
Gilda...
I'm a pretty gloomy guy tonight.
I have an idea I'm going to be rather bad company.
Why don't you -
Why don't you go out to a movie or something?
Tarzan is playing at the Adelphia Theatre.
Go on, like a good girl.
Everything seems different, doesn't it?
You'd better go, Gilda, to Tarzan.
I fancy this, uh - what you might call tension... would keep up for some weeks.
Wouldn't it be wiser if I moved to a hotel?
Yes, ma'am.
I love you, Gilda. Why lie about it?
You can't change love by shaking hands with somebody.
We're unreal, the three of us, trying to play jokes on nature.
This is real.
A million times more honest than all the art in the world.
I love you.
It's true we have a gentleman's agreement... but unfortunately I am no gentleman.
My dearest Gilda and dear George.
This is the first letter I've ever dictated... so kindly overlook its correct spelling and perfect punctuation.
An honest heart still beats beneath.
Exclamation point, dash, paragraph.
Well, pals, you'll be interested to know... that all London is agog with my wit and charm.
Underline "charm."
Period.
Lady Upterdyke, weight 203 ringside... has smuggled me into her cage of trained social lions.
Here I am on exhibition nightly... up to my neck in duchesses.
Period.
The play, by the way, is in its second week of rehearsals... and looks hotsy-totsy.
I beg your pardon, sir. "Hotsy-totsy"?
Yes, hotsy-totsy.
And yet, dear friends, these triumphs leave me sad.
In the midst of all this pomp and glitter...
I always remember that our play was written... on that old Remington Number 2 typewriter... and on a never-to-be-forgotten diet of frankfurters.
Sir?
My heart is in the highlands of Montmartre.
And the - Come in. And the night finds me pale and thoughtful, waiting -
And the night finds me pale and thoughtful... waiting for the end of my exile when the three of us...
Athos, Porthos and Mademoiselle d'Artagnan... will sit in the royal box at the opening -
Start the letter over.
Dear George and Gilda:
Good luck.
As ever, Tom.
- Good evening, Mr. Chambers. - Good evening. Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Chambers. - Good evening.
- How's the house tonight? - Completely sold out.
- Advance sale? - Colossal!
- Audience behaving? - Angelic.
- Applauding? - Terrific.
Thanks.
- How are the programs selling tonight? - Enormous!
- Busy? - Tremendous.
And what were you doing on the fire escape?
Cooling off.
And what was your mandolin doing in my bed?
I must ask you to leave my mandolin out of this.
Edgar, I have only one thing to say to you.
Immorality may be fun, but not fun enough... to take the place of 100% virtue and three square meals a day!
- That's the funniest show, I think. Don't you? - You like that actor?
I really enjoyed that show very much.
- How do you do, Mr. Plunkett? - How do you do?
- Oh, Mr. Chambers! - Yes?
Well, hello.
That's a very funny play you've got in there, in spots.
Thank you. Thank you. How
Oh, great. Fine. Advertising going bigger than ever.
- The French are getting billboard crazy. - I see. Hmm.
And how - how's Paris otherwise?
- Oh, you don't know what happened. - No. What?
Well, it's, uh, quite a story.
The, uh, French government objected to showing Napoleon in union suits.
Well, I was up against it for a while, but I changed it... to Julius Caesar.
I'll tell you something - outsold Napoleon 2-to-1.
- Hmm. - Just goes to show.
Anything - Anything else going on in Paris?
Mmm, no. No.
Well, I'm glad I ran into you. Yes. Pretty good play for the money.
Oh, Mr. Chambers. I almost forgot. Best regards from George and Gilda.
Oh, thanks, thanks. How is George?
We're friends.
As you know, at first I was inclined to withhold my approval of the whole thing... but you know how much I like Gilda.
It's true I didn't get to first base, but lots of other people didn't either.
Yeah.
Uh, is George, uh - Is George getting - getting along nicely?
Oh, great, great. He painted me. A portrait, from here up.
- Hmm. - That put him over in the art world. Yes, sir.
And, uh, how - how is Gilda?
Fine. When they first broached the project of painting me, I put my foot down, but Gilda -
- How-How is she? - Fine.
Turned out to be a great painting. It's a masterpiece.
Looks exactly like me. It's called "Man With Derby."
- Mmm. - Yes, sir.
French museum bought it. Snapped it right up.
I'm hanging on exhibition on the south wall.
- Hmm! - Attracts lots of people.
Yes, sir.
Is, uh - Is Gilda happy? Is she -
Oh, she's just crazy about that painting.
Well, I'm glad I ran into you. I don't want to miss this last act. Yes.
My things, please.
Terrific tonight, isn't it?
Rather.
Excusez-moi.
C'est bien chez Monsieur Curtis?
Non. Monsieur Curtis a déménagé.
Il demeure cent quinze rue de la Faisanderie.
- Merci bien. - Il n'y a pas de quoi, monsieur.
Pourrais-je parler à Monsieur Curtis?
- You want to talk to Mr. Curtis, don't you? - Yes.
Well, I'm sorry, but Mr. Curtis is not at home.
Oh. What time do you expect him back?
Well, Mr. Curtis is out of town.
That's too bad.
- Something important? - Rather.
Well, I'll let you talk to his secretary.
To his, uh, secretary?
Yes, to his secretary. Please.
Hello.
- Mr. Curtis's secretary? - The same.
My card.
"Thomas B. Chambers, London's leading playwright... and foremost wit."
Oh, come on. It doesn't say that.
It should.
- Hello, you old vampire, you! - You hooligan!
- You Benedict Arnold! - You -
Shall we be seated?
- Mmm! Like your suit. - Oh, thanks very much.
I'm sorry George isn't here.
He's in Nice. He's painting a Mrs. Butterfield.
Really?
A rotund but noble creature from Des Moines.
- Mmm. Des Moines, Iowa. - Yes.
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Is it?
- I've so much to - - To tell me.
Yes.
I can imagine.
Oh, Tommy, if you've forgiven George, why not me?
- We did the same thing. - Not at all.
George betrayed me for you.
Without wishing to flatter you, I understood that.
I can still understand it.
But you betrayed me for George.
An incredible choice.
Tommy.
You didn't keep it oiled.
I did for a while.
The keys are rusty... and the shift is broken.
But it still rings.
It still rings.
Does it?
Oh! Mr. Plunkett. Please.
Gilda?
- Hello, Gilda. - Hello.
I must get in touch with George immediately.
I just got back from London, dropped into the Luxembourg Museum with some friends... and big results for George.
- I'm glad. - A commission for two portraits.
Mrs. Olsen of Buffalo. You know the Buffalo Olsens.
- Oh, yes. - And Ernie Maxwell, the tomato juice man.
- The tomato juice man. - Hmm. Both are willing to pay as high as -
Why, what's the matter? Is George back? Why didn't you tell me?
- He came unexpectedly this morning. - He did?
- Mm-hmm. - George!
Shh! He's asleep.
He only arrived a couple of hours ago. He had a dreadful night on the train.
You know, his old neuralgia's back.
Oh. Well, you tell him to get in touch with me just as soon as he wakes up.
- Good-bye. - Good-bye. Thanks, Max.
- Oh, I almost - - Shh!
I almost forgot to tell you. Guess who I saw in London.
- The king? - No, no, no! Tom Chambers.
Oh. How is he?
Well, I wouldn't want George to hear this, but if you ask me, no good.
You made the right choice, all right - in a way.
That guy in there - 10 times as good.
Max, do me a favor. Go away.
Of course, I know, you always had a soft spot for this fellow Chambers.
Please, Max. I've a terrible headache.
Why, what's the matter? Anything wrong?
No. Just one of my blue days.
- Can I do anything for you? - No, Max, please!
Well, uh, don't tell George that I even mentioned Tom.
I wouldn't want to be mixed up - You know how it is.
- It's a rather delicate matter. - And you don't want to broach it.
- No. - Then don't.
- Good-bye, Max. - Good-bye.
- Thanks. - Why don't you try some aspirin?
Oh, you're sweet, Max, but aspirin won't help this time.
- Nothing serious, I hope. - I hope not.
Well, if - if anything should happen -
I'll come to you and ask for your advice.
- Will you? - Always, Max.
- Thank you, Gilda. - Thank you.
Good-bye.
Breakfast is ready.
No orange juice?
We never have any.
Darling, will you remember after this - orange juice every morning, hmm?
Large glass.
Every morning, huh?
Except Sunday.
Uh, baked apple.
It's going to make a big revolution in my menu.
The eggs are just right.
You can have mine too.
- No eggs for Gilda? - No.
- Conscience bothering you? - No.
Confused?
Very much so.
- Gilda. - Yes?
Is George still given to smashing things?
Well, we have to tell him the truth regardless of what happens to the furniture.
I wonder if he'll hit me.
He was never very civilized.
You're right. He is kind of - kind of barbaric.
You know, Gilda, we did a marvelous job on that third act... and I have a feeling that if we got together and collaborated on a note to leave behind... and really worked on it... it would not only be a very fine piece of literature... but it might save me a black eye.
No, no, I can't run away. I don't know how I'm going to tell him.
I don't dare think.
I don't even know what I'm going to tell him.
It's very simple.
You love me.
That's the only thing I'm sure of right now.
Let's forget the rest. Let's not talk about it.
We've two more days. Let's enjoy them.
Oh, my dear!
Tommy, I never forgot you.
In fact, you never left me.
You haunted me like a nasty ghost.
On rainy nights, I could hear you moaning down the chimney.
Tommy. Tommy.
- What'll we do after lunch? - We'll take a long walk for our digestion.
Oh, yes, let's walk and walk until we're dead tired.
Gilda, I've got a better idea.
Let's stay home instead.
Well, London Louie, the old rat himself!
- You phony playwright! How are you? - I'm fine.
- When did you arrive? - La-Last night.
Boy, I can't tell you how -
- How are you, darling? - Fine.
I forgot to kiss you. You can blame him.
- Well, how are you, pal? - Ouch!
Fine.
Lucky I walked out on the Butterfields.
Well, what happened?
Oh, a very involved argument about la Butterfield's double chin.
I said to her, "Madam, I am an artist, not a masseur."
Up speaks Mr. Butterfield, and, uh -
What are you doing in that suit?
Tuxedo for breakfast, huh? Is that a new London custom?
- George - - I didn't ask you.
Well, Tom.
You know what I'm thinking.
It's true.
- George - - Shut up!
Well, that's one way of meeting the situation.
Shipping clerk comes home, finds missus with boarder.
He breaks dishes.
It's pure burlesque.
Then there's another way.
Intelligent artist returns unexpectedly, finds treacherous friends.
Both discuss the pros and cons of the situation in grown-up dialogue.
High-class comedy, enjoyed by everybody.
And there's a third way.
I'll kick your teeth out, tear your head off and beat some decency into you!
Cheap melodrama. Very dull.
George, stop it.
Still very dull.
I suppose you feel sorry for him.
I feel sorry for you.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
But it was inevitable.
Go on. Get out of here, both of you.
It's hard to believe I - I loved you both.
- George! - I don't want any part of either of you.
Go with him in his top hat and fancy pants and silly name in lights... and good luck to both of you!
The London train leaves at 4:00.
You'll be very happy.
I promise.
Thank you, Tom.
I'll pack.
Good-bye, George.
You did the right thing about the Butterfields.
And, George... after I've gone, don't change.
Don't ever bow to double chins.
Stay an artist.
That's important.
In fact, the most important thing.
I didn't want to praise you in front of Gilda, but you certainly pack a wicked right.
A real wallop.
There are a number of things here which belong to her.
Oh, that's all right. Never mind.
No, no, I don't want them. Where shall I send them?
Forward them in my name in care of the Carlton Theatre, London.
- And her mail? - Same place. I'll see that she gets it.
- Anything else? - Not that I can think of.
If anything should come up, will you be at this address?
That's immaterial. I don't wish to enter into any correspondence.
As you wish.
Better tell her to hurry up. It's getting to be a strain.
- Well, you gotta give her a chance to pack. - Well, tell her to hurry up!
All right! All right!
Hurry up, Gilda!
Hurry up, darling.
Here, you rattlesnake.
- So that's how you feel. - Yes, that's how I feel. Understand?
Perfectly.
I felt that way once.
Gilda, have you got room in your trunk?
Here. For you.
- What's that? - A note from Gilda.
"Tommy dear."
I am running away because I am afraid your house in London has a chimney too... and I fancy on rainy nights, I would hear -
And I fancy on rainy nights, I would hear that old devil George moaning.
So be nice, and let me be nice.
"Maybe I'll like it. Gilda."
- You think she'll come back? - No.
Should we try to find her?
What's the use?
The mother of the arts wants to be a nice girl.
Tragic.
No, it's comic.
Two slightly used artists in the ash can.
You'll get drunk.
It's the only sensible thing to do.
To Gilda.
Would you care to hit me? Please help yourself.
Sorry. I'm too high-class.
- A gentleman, huh? - To my fingertips.
May I refer you to a letter sent to you from London in a similar crisis?
A very high-class document.
I could have enclosed some smallpox germs easily.
But you didn't.
Very considerate.
Let's drink to that.
To smallpox germs.
In Latin, variola cocci.
I think we're being very sensible.
Extremely.
- Good for our livers. - Good for our immortal souls.
But bad for our stomachs.
Ah! That's loose thinking.
What's bad for your stomach may be highly entertaining for my stomach.
I'm glad the conversation has taken a scientific turn.
Well, it's better than discussing this Gilda.
- We must forget Gilda. - Utterly.
- Let's change the subject. - Right.
Let's talk about something entirely new.
Let's talk about ourselves.
Very interesting.
- To ourselves. - No.
It's bad taste.
Well, we can't drink to nothing.
Well, it's better than drinking to ourselves.
- To nothing. - No!
I refuse to be silly.
That's right.
Well, there must be a reason for drinking.
- To, uh - - No!
I beg your pardon.
To Kaplan and McGuire.
Uh, don't be hasty.
To Kaplan.
And now to McGuire.
A letter to my mother.
Mrs. Oscar F. Plunkett, Utica, New York.
Dear Mama:
I will arrive on the 25th of this month on the U.S. Liner S.S. Manhattan.
I will be accompanied by Miss Gilda Farrell.
Miss Gilda Farrell is the daughter of Mr. And Mrs. Anthony G. Farrell... of Fargo, North Dakota.
- Got the ring? - Check.
- Feel nervous, Max? - No.
Had a fine nap. Feel a hundred percent.
How does it feel to be Mrs. Plunkett? Any different?
Well, it feels like standing with your feet on the ground.
Peaceful, Max, and so secure.
You bet.
It's going to be nice to be a law-abiding citizen.
Gilda!
What lovely flowers.
"Strump and Egelbauer."
Very fine people, Strump and Egelbauer.
- Biggest cement people in town. - Oh.
Oh, you'll like 'em.
They sound adorable.
- Gilda. - Yes, Max?
Now that it's all over - the excitement, et cetera -
I'd like to know, what's your attitude?
My attitude? Well, toward what?
I mean, do you love me?
Oh, Max.
People should never ask that question on their wedding night.
It's either too late or too early.
I'm your wife, Max.
That's well put.
- Gilda, it's 9:30. - Oh, that late?
Yes, and I have an appointment in the morning, 10:15 sharp.
Oh, yes.
Beautiful!
"Kaplan and McGuire"!
Your friends from now on, as well as mine.
What did they do that for?
Why, they want to remember us. I think it's very nice of them.
This is no time for remembering.
It would have been much more tactful of them to forget. I think it's offensive.
Oh, well, now, that's a closed chapter in your life.
Anyhow, you've nothing to worry about on that score.
- I've forgiven you. - Forgiven me? For what?
Oh, that's all right.
- Well, I don't want to be forgiven! - Well, I forgive you just the same.
It'll make you feel better.
It's their idea of a joke.
I can just see them sitting in China, laughing their heads off.
About what?
It's a rotten trick.
- It's cheap. - Well, it shouldn't surprise you.
They never fooled me for a minute. Hooligans.
Max, I don't care to discuss them at all... but if you ever feel it's necessary to mention them... don't call them hooligans!
Oh, well, of course, they have some fine qualities.
Please stop talking about them!
It's my wedding night.
Leave those two boys where they are - in China!
I've an appointment tomorrow morning.
10:15 sharp. It's important.
- Hello, darling. - Hello.
Well, Gilda. Great news for you.
- Our party's in the bag. - Really?
- Yes, sir. Guess what. - I give up.
- Mr. Egelbauer has accepted. - Is that good?
Say, listen, I'll guarantee you one thing -
Let this party be a success, and inside of two weeks we'll be invited to the Egelbauers.
I see. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
Oh, don't talk like that.
Strump and Egelbauer are figuring on the greatest publicity campaign in the history of cement.
Well, what about the Strumps? Don't we have to invite them too?
Mr. Strump comes first. "Strump and Egelbauer."
No, no, no. We can't have them at the same time.
- They're not on speaking terms. - That's right.
I forgot about Mr. Strump and Mrs. Egelbauer.
Oh, don't mention that!
Don't even breathe it.
- I won't. - You promise?
Promise.
Word of honor?
Cross my heart.
And please don't worry about the Strumps.
A week from Tuesday we have the Strumps.
That's diplomacy.
And if this Strump party is a big social success... is there any chance we'll be invited to the Strumps?
- It's a cinch. - What a season!
Everybody, please. Everybody who wants to play Twenty Questions, all in the living room.
Everybody who wants to play Twenty Questions, all in the living room.
Oh, that sounds fun!
Everybody who wants to play -
Gilda, what are you doing here?
- Just resting between rounds. - Oh.
Well, we're going to play Twenty Questions in the living room.
- Mr. Egelbauer's requested it. - Oh, Max!
Oh, it's gonna be great fun.
But I've had so much fun all evening. It's almost too much for me.
Post Office with Kaplan and McGuire.
Drop the Handkerchief with the linoleum group.
But Mr. Egelbauer -
Well, I've just played Going to Jerusalem with Mr. Egelbauer.
Well, now he wants to play Twenty Questions.
Oh, you've got to come. There's no way of getting out of it.
All right.
We'll start right away.
All right, Gilda.
Is it animal, vegetable or mineral?
Are you expected?
No, not exactly expected.
Anticipated, uh, hoped for and dreamed about.
- Do you wish to see Mr. Plunkett? - No!
- Positively no. - Mrs. Plunkett, if you please.
Mrs. Plunkett is engaged in playing Twenty Questions.
- She can't be disturbed. - Oh! Oh, I see.
- Twenty Questions? - Mmm.
- Hmm. - It makes it rather difficult.
Well, uh, what you say, Inspector?
I beg your pardon. This is Inspector Knox.
- How do you do, sir? - How do you do?
Well, Sergeant - Excuse me. Sergeant O'Toole.
- How do you do? - How do you do, sir?
Headquarters.
Shall I notify them?
Oh, no, don't bother, please. We'll, uh - We'll wait.
- Any trouble? - No, no, not at all.
We're only here in behalf of the Policeman's Benefit Ball.
- About some tickets? - Righto.
All right. Wait if you want to.
Well, uh, Inspector... how did the butler strike you?
- A dual personality. - Hmm.
Shall we, uh, look over the premises?
Righto, Sergeant.
We may run into some valuable clues.
- Shall we start with the kitchen? - No.
- Let's begin with the boudoir. - Ah.
- Animal, vegetable or mineral? - Animal!
- Gilda! - I won't do it!
I guessed Mr. Egelbauer in 10 questions, and that's enough. I'm worn out.
Gilda, I insist.
I won't do it!
- You're ruining everything. - I don't care!
I won't ask Mr. Egelbauer to sing.
- All right. Then I'll have to ask him myself. - Fine!
- And you'll have to come downstairs and listen. - Nothing doing.
But he-he - he brought his music.
I'm not going to listen to that Egelbauer sing!
I won't! I won't! I won't!
Oh, please, Max, let me rest.
All right. Get your rest.
Take two minutes and come down.
Oh, Egelbauer!
- # Egelbauer # - # Egelbauer #
# Egelbauer #
Well, dear me. Look who's here.
How did you get in?
- Shall we tell her? - I would. We have nothing to conceal.
The stork brought us.
I thought you were in China.
We moved.
- Shall we sit down? - Yes, please.
That's Tom.
- And that's George. - And this is Gilda.
Oh, no, that's not Gilda. That's Mrs. Plunkett.
- No, that's Gilda. - Oh, let's see.
Well, there's a certain resemblance.
You're right. It's Mrs. Plunkett.
But from here - from here she looks a teeny-weeny bit like Max.
- Maybe it's Mr. Plunkett. - Oh, I doubt it.
# Falling leaf #
# And fading tree #
# Love - #
- He really fell in the river? - Feet first!
What's this? What's going on here?
We have callers from China.
What are you doing here?
- Shh! - We're hiding from Mr. Egelbauer.
Listen, this is no time for jokes. I haven't invited you.
I don't want you here, and neither does Gilda.
Gilda, you must come down. Egelbauer's on his second song.
- Egelbauer! Egelbauer! - Well, what am I going to say?
One moment, Mr. Plunkett.
Question: Who is this Mr. Egelbauer?
You see, Mr. Egelbauer is not only a first-rate singer... but he's also the head of Strump and E -
I want you two to leave these premises at once!
Well, Inspector, what do you think?
Animal, vegetable or mineral?
Vegetable.
# Sky #
# Good-bye, summer #
# Good-bye #
Egelbauer!
# Good-bye #
# Good-bye #
What do you mean by smashing into all this?
You arranged all this. You were expecting 'em.
Don't be silly. I arranged nothing. I knew nothing about it.
- Well, how'd they get here then? - The stork brought 'em.
Oh, I see. I see what you mean. Hooligans!
That's what they are, and that's what they always will be!
Maybe they are. Maybe I'm a hooligan too.
Maybe I want to be a hooligan.
No. No, Gilda, no. No, you don't.
- Uh, you want a glass of water? - No, thank you.
Now, I'm willing to drop the whole matter. I forgive you.
Are you starting to forgive me again?
Now, just relax and be a good girl. I'll handle this.
You let me go down first, and I'll sell them the idea that - that you've had an attack of hiccups.
And then two minutes later you come down, and you tell Mr. Egelbauer -
- I'll tell him! - Yes. You tell Mr. Egelbauer that you're extremely sorry.
Make a simple little apology, but sincere.
Say that you heard his singing all the way upstairs... and even at that distance it was wonderful.
Now, listen, Plunkett, Incorporated!
You go down to those customers of yours and give them a sales talk.
Sell them anything you want, but not me.
I'm fed up with underwear, cement, linoleum!
I'm sick of being a trademark married to a slogan!
- Gilda! - Don't you tell 'em I've got hiccups.
Tell 'em I've got the advertising blues, the billboard collywobbles!
Slogans and sales talks morning, noon and night... and not one human sound out of you and your whole flock of Egelbauers!
That's just a lot of words. There's only one issue here.
If this Strump and Egelbauer deal is spoiled, I'll know just who to blame.
- Where - Where is everybody? - I think they've all gone home.
Gone home? What for? Why?
- You should never have socked McGuire. - Socked McGuire?
I admit I was a bit careless, but how should I know Kaplan would creep up in the back?
That's partnership.
- Kaplan? Creep up in the back? - Yes.
But the real surprise of the evening was Egelbauer.
- He starts slow - - But warms up. Wonderful footwork.
Wh-What - What - What happened?
- Was there a fight? - A marvelous fight!
It was quite a demonstration.
- Gilda! - I know all about it.
I'm awfully sorry, Max, but it all can be remedied very easily.
But we've got to do something about it at once.
Quite right. But let me do it. After all, it's my friends who caused the trouble, and I'm to blame.
- Well, what do you - - Max, I'm going to make a great sacrifice for your business.
I'm going to leave you.
Leave me? You're crazy. That won't help.
Oh, yes, it will, tremendously.
Now, tomorrow you put on your nicest derby and you go and call on your customers... and tell 'em you've separated from your wife... because of her connection with those two terrible wretches.
I guarantee you, you'll be considered the biggest martyr in the history of cement.
So, I see.
That's the way you feel about the matter.
Good old Max. Cheer up.
You really haven't any complaints.
I've more than doubled your business since our bridal night... and after I leave you, it's liable to triple.
That's all you really wanted anyway.
Now, Gilda, be sensible.
Oh. That's Mr. Egelbauer.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Mr. Egelbauer.
Oh, how are you, Mr. Egelbauer?
So! And poor Mrs. Egelbauer - How is she?
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Well, Mr. Egelbauer, you must realize that I had nothing to do with it whatsoever.
Good-bye, Max.
Gilda, just a minute! Y-Yes, Mr. Egelbauer?
Oh, I can explain everything to your fullest satisfaction.
I guarantee it.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Egelbauer. Oh, that's big of you.
Tomorrow morning, 9:00 sharp.
Oh, you've made me a very happy man, Mr. Egelbauer!
Now we'll have some fun. Back to Paris.
- To the same old studio? - The same old dump.
- And work! - Great.
- But you can't paint in that suit. - I'll burn it.
- And you can't write in that top hat. - In the ash can with it!
Let's hear, Gilda. Can you still say "rotten"?
Rotten!
Gilda, you gonna criticize us with that baseball bat of yours?
Till you say "uncle."
Ha-ha! Gilda!
Dear critic!
But, boys, this is very important. There's one thing that has to be understood.
- I know. - Yes, we know.
It's a gentleman's agreement.
Mrs. Teasdale.
Yes, Your Excellency?
I again ask you to reconsider.
Gentlemen, I've already loaned Freedonia more than half the fortune my husband left me.
I consider that money lost. And now, you're asking for another $20 million.
But it would only be for a few months to meet this present emergency.
With $20 million in the treasury, we can announce an immediate reduction in the taxes.
That's all that the people are asking for.
I'm sorry, but I'm inclined to agree with the people.
The government has been mismanaged.
What? I will lend the money but only on condition that His Excellency withdraw and place the government in new hands.
You ask me to give up my office?
Yes, Your Excellency.
In a crisis like this, I feel Freedonia needs a new leader, a progressive, fearless fighter!
A man like Rufus T. Firefly!
Rufus T. Firefly?
I will lend the money to Freedonia only if Firefly is appointed leader.
The Honorable Secretary of Finance and Party.
His Excellency, Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania.
Ambassador.
It was so good of you to come.
I'm anxious for you to meet the new leader of our country.
No matter who rules in Freedonia, Mrs. Teasdale, to me, you will always be the first lady of the land.
Oh, permit me. This is Miss Vera Marcal.
Ambassador Trentino.
Miss Marcal needs no introduction,
I've seen her dance many times at the theater.
Thank you.
The Honorable Pandooh of Mufhtan.
I must greet His Honor.
What have you found out?
Nothing. I've been waiting to hear from you.
I've given up the idea of a revolution. I have a better plan.
Oh, yes? I can gain control of Freedonia much easier by marrying Mrs. Teasdale.
Maybe that's not going to be so easy.
Eh? Oh, from what I hear. You see, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
Oh, well, that's where you come in. I'm going to place him in your hands.
And I don't have to tell you what to do or how to...
Careful.
I want you to meet His Excellency's Secretary, Bob Roland.
Ambassador Trentino. How do you do, sir?
Miss Marcal.
We've met.
Of course. Well, I hope His Excellency gets here soon.
His Excellency makes it a point always to be on time.
As long as I've known him, he's never been late for an appointment.
His Excellency is due to take his station
Beginning his new administration
He'll make his appearance when
The clock on the wall strikes 10:00
When the clock on the wall strikes 10:00
All you loyal ladies and you patriotic men
Let's sing the national anthem when
The clock on the wall strikes 10:00
His Excellency is due to take his station
Beginning his new administration
He'll make his appearance when
The clock on the wall strikes 10:00
We'll give him a rousing cheer
To show him we're glad he's here
Hail, hail Freedonia
Hail, hail Freedonia
Land of the brave And free
Hail, hail Freedonia
Land of the brave and free
Hail, hail Freedonia
Land of the brave and free
You expecting somebody?
Yes.
Hail, hail Freedonia
Land of the brave and free
Oh, Your Excellency, we've been expecting you.
As Chairwoman of the Reception Committee,
I extend the good wishes of every man, woman and child of Freedonia.
Never mind that stuff.
Take a card.
Card? What'll I do with a card?
You can keep it. I've got 51 left.
Now what were you saying?
As Chairwoman of the Reception Committee,
I welcome you with open arms.
Is that so? How late do you stay open?
I've sponsored your appointment because I feel you are the most able statesman in all Freedonia.
Well, that covers a lot of ground.
Say, you cover a lot of ground yourself. You'd better beat it.
I hear they're gonna tear you down and put up an office building where you're standing.
You can leave in a taxi. If you can't get a taxi, you can leave in a huff.
If that's too soon, you can leave in a minute and a huff.
You know, you haven't stopped talking since I came here.
You must have been vaccinated with a phonograph needle.
The future of Freedonia rests on you.
Promise me you'll follow in the footsteps of my husband.
How do you like that?
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.
Not that I care, but where is your husband?
Why, he's dead.
I'll bet he's just using that as an excuse.
I was with him till the very end.
Hmm! No wonder he passed away.
I held him in my arms and kissed him.
Oh, I see. Then it was murder.
Will you marry me?
Did he leave you any money?
Answer the second question first.
He left me his entire fortune.
Is that so? Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?
I love you.
Oh, Your Excellency!
You're not so bad yourself.
Oh, I want to present to you Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania.
Having him with us today is indeed a great pleasure.
Thank you, but I can't stay very long.
That's even a greater pleasure.
Now, how about lending this country $20 million, you old skinflint?
$20 million is a lot of money. I'd have to take that up with my Minister of Finance.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $12 until payday?
$12?
Don't be scared. You'll get it back.
I'll give you my personal note for 90 days.
If it isn't paid by then, you can keep the note.
Your Excellency, haven't we seen each other somewhere before?
I don't think so. I'm not sure I'm seeing you now.
Must be something I ate. Look here, sir!
Are you trying to...
Don't look now, but there's one man too many in this room, and I think it's you.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I want you to meet a very charming lady.
And it's about time.
Just a moment.
I want to present Miss Vera Marcal.
Go ahead. I can take it.
Oh, you don't understand.
This is Vera Marcal, the famous dancer.
Is that so?
Can you do this one?
I danced before Napoleon.
No, Napoleon danced before me. In fact, he danced 200 years before me.
Here's one I picked up in a dance hall.
Here's another one I picked up in a dance hall.
Perhaps sometime we get a chance to dance together, huh?
I could dance with you till the cows come home.
Yeah? On second thought, I'd rather dance with the cows till you come home.
Where is my secretary?
Here I am.
Good heavens, Your Excellency!
Uh, take a letter.
Who to? To my dentist.
"Dear dentist, enclosed find check for $500. Yours very truly."
Send it off immediately!
I'll have to enclose the check first.
You do and I'll fire you.
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.
Notables from every country are gathered here in your honor.
This is a gala day for you.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I don't think I could handle anymore.
If it's not asking too much...
For our information, just for illustration
Tell us how you intend to run the nation
These are the laws of my administration
No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke
And whistling is forbidden
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke
Hail, hail Freedonia
If chewing gum is chewed the chewer is pursued
And in the hoosegow hidden
If we choose to chew we'll be pursued
If any form of pleasure is exhibited
Report to me and it will be prohibited
I'll put my foot down So shall it be
This is the land of the free
The last man nearly ruined this place
He didn't know what to do with it If you think this country's bad off now
The country's taxes must be fixed
And I know what to do with it If you think you're paying too much now Just wait till I get through with it
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair
I'm strictly on the up and up so everyone beware
If anyone's caught taking graft and I don't get my share
We stand 'em up against the wall and pop goes the weasel
So everyone beware who's crooked or unfair
No one must take a bit of graft unless he gets his share
If any man should come between a husband and his bride
We find out which one she prefers by letting her decide
If she prefers the other man the husband steps outside
We stand 'em up against the wall and pop goes the weasel
The husband steps outside, relinquishes his bride
They stand him up against the wall and take away his bride
You have an appointment at the House of Representatives.
Good heavens! You can't go with your trousers up!
I can't, eh? Well, they'll never catch me any other way.
My car!
His Excellency's car!
His Excellency's car!
His Excellency's car!
I'm in a hurry. To the House of Representatives.
Ride like fury. If you run out of gas, get ethyl. If Ethel runs out, get Mabel.
Now step on it!
Well, it certainly feels good to be back again.
I have failed, Ambassador.
I know it, I know it, you idiot!
I'm sorry.
You have muddled everything.
If you'd started the revolution as I planned, during the turmoil
I could've stepped in and placed Freedonia under the Sylvanian flag, our flag.
But Firefly blocked us!
Your Excellency, you have no idea how popular he is in Freedonia.
Oh, yes, I've known of that, too!
That's why I have two spies shadowing him.
I want to find out something about him, something to disgrace him, to discredit him with the people.
Ambassador, Chicolini and Pinky are here.
Now, these are my spies. Show them in.
We fool you good, eh?
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, what is this?
Shh! This is spy stuff.
Telegram for you, sir.
He gets mad because he can't read.
Oh, I see.
Well, gentlemen, we have serious matters to discuss.
Please be seated.
Rock-a-bye...
Gentlemen, gentlemen!
Now, about that information...
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Here, have a cigar. That's a good quarter cigar.
I smoked the other three-quarters myself.
Yes. No, thank you, I have one of my own.
Here.
Hey, that's no good.
That's good!
That's fine.
That's good.
Now let's concentrate.
Have you been trailing Firefly?
Have we been trailing Firefly?
Why, my partner, he's got a nose just like a bloodhound.
Really? Yeah. And the rest of his face don't look so good either.
Look, we find out all about this Firefly.
Here, look at this.
Ah, very good, very good!
Wait a minute. We must not be disturbed.
Yes, sir?
This is a very important conference.
I do not wish to be interrupted.
Yes, sir.
Gentlemen, we are not getting anywhere.
You're out!
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
Now gentlemen, please!
SWill you tell me what you found out about Firefly?
Well, you remember you gave us a picture of this man and said,
"Follow him"? Oh, yes.
Well, we get on the job right away.
And in one hour, even less than one hour...
Yes?
...we lose the picture. That's a pretty quick work, eh?
But I asked you to dig up something I can use against Firefly.
Did you bring me his record?
No, no!
And the boy gets a cigar.
Now, Chicolini, I want a full detailed report of your investigation.
All right, I tell you. Monday, we watch Firefly's house, but he no come out.
He wasn't home.
Tuesday, we go to the ball game, but he fool us.
He no show up. Wednesday, he go to the ball game, but we fool him!
We no show up. Thursday was a double-header, nobody show up.
Friday, it rained all day. There was no ball game.
So we stayed home and we listened to it over the radio.
Then you didn't shadow Firefly!
Oh, sure we shadow Firefly. We shadow him all day.
But what day was that?
Shaderday! That's some joke, huh, boss?
Now, will you tell me, what happened on Saturday?
I'm glad you asked me.
We follow this man down to a road house.
And at this road house he meet a married lady.
A married lady?
Yeah, I think it was his wife.
Firefly has no wife!
No?
No!
Then you know what I think, boss?
What? I think we followed the wrong man.
Oh, gentlemen, I am disappointed.
I entrusted you with a mission of great importance and you failed.
However, I am going to give you one more chance.
I have credentials here that will get you into any place in Freedonia.
If I can only...
Ah, here we are.
Are you sure that you can trap Firefly?
Remember, this time I expect results.
Goodbye and good luck.
Okay, Cap.
Come on, Pinky.
Goodbye.
All right, the meeting's called to order.
Your Excellency, here's the Treasury Department's report.
I hope you'll find it clear.
Clear?
Huh! Why, a 4-year-old child could understand this report.
Run out and find me a 4-year-old child. I can't make head or tail out of it.
And now, members of the cabinet, we'll take up old business.
I wish to discuss the tariff.
Sit down, that's new business.
No old business?
Very well. Then we'll take up new business.
Now about that tariff...
Too late!
That's old business already. Sit down.
Gentlemen, as your Secretary of War, I...
The Secretary of War is out of order!
Which reminds me, so is the plumbing. Make a note of that.
Never mind, I'll do it myself.
The Department of Labor wishes to report that the workers of Freedonia are demanding shorter hours.
Very well, we'll give them shorter hours.
We'll start by cutting their lunch hour to 20 minutes.
And now, gentlemen, we've got to start looking for a new Treasurer.
But you appointed one last week!
That's the one I'm looking for.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, enough of this. How about taking up the tax?
How about taking up the carpet?
I still insist we must take up the tax!
He's right, you've got to take up the tacks before you can take up the carpet.
I give all my time and energy to my duties and what do I get?
You get awfully tiresome after a while.
Sir, you try my patience.
I don't mind if I do. You must come over and try mine sometime.
That's the last straw!
I resign!
I wash my hands off the whole business.
That's a good idea. You can wash your neck, too.
Peanuts!
Hey, come here!
Just the guy I wanna see.
What do you find out about this guy Firefly?
You find out something?
You no find out something?
You spy on him?
You no spy on him?
What's the matter?
All the time I talk to you, you no say nothing.
What's the matter, you no speak, eh?
Stop this!
What you find, eh?
What you find?
That's no good!
Hey, come here. You're crazy.
What's the matter with you? Why you make a face like this?
What's the matter with you?
Ah, come on, you wanna fight, huh?
You wanna fight? Come on, I give you fight.
Hey, upstairs this time, no downstairs!
Come on.
What you think you are, eh?
Hey, what's the idea of fighting in front of my place and driving my customers away?
Hey, mister, you got a mistake someplace.
I no fight. You understand, this guy, he's working for me.
I ask him something, and he no tell me nothing.
I ask him why he no speak, all the time he no speak.
What do you think he do?
He make fight go like this.
Hey, what's the idea?
That's not my idea, that's his idea.
All time I say something, he no say nothing.
Every time I say...
Will you shut up?
Hey, listen, what are you doing around here?
Who are you?
Hey, can't you say...
Can't you say anything?
No! He no say nothing, he...
Oh, shut up!
I am shut up, but, mister, you no understand.
Look, he's a spy and I'm a spy.
He work for me. I want him to find out something but he no find out what I wanna find out.
Now how am I gonna find out what I wanna find out if he no find out what I gotta find out?
Will you quit annoying me?
All right, I quit. All you gotta do is make him stop doing this.
Now just for that, I'm gonna tear you limb from limb, limb from limb!
You'd think they'd do the same...
You see, I no say one thing, mister, before when you...
No, no.
Now, now I'm gonna get you!
What are you doing?
Why, you...
I'll teach you to kick me!
You don't have to teach me. I know how.
Stop it. Look out!
Oh!
That's good, eh?
Peanuts!
Hey!
You wanna be a public nuisance?
Sure, how much does the job pay?
I've got a good mind to join a club and beat you over the head with it.
Peanuts to you!
Have you got a license?
License? No, but my dog, he's got millions of 'em.
Believe me, he's some smart dog.
You know, he went with Admiral Byrd to the Pole.
I'll bet the dog got to the Pole first.
You win.
Come on up here. I wanna scare the cabinet.
Hello?
Hello? No, no, he's not in.
All right, I tell him.
Goodbye. That was for you.
I'm sorry I'm not in. I want to have a long talk with you.
Now listen here, you give up that silly peanut stand and I'll get you a soft government job.
Now let's see, how would you like a job in the mint?
Mint? No, no.
I no like mint.
What other flavor you got?
Hello?
Hello? No, not yet.
All right, I tell him. Goodbye. Thank you.
That was for you again.
I wonder whatever became of me.
I should have been back here a long time ago.
Now listen here, I've got a swell job for you, but first I have to ask you a couple of important questions.
Now, what is it that has four pair of pants, lives in Philadelphia, and it never rains but it pours?
That's a good one. I give you three guesses.
Now let me see, has four pair of pants, lives in Philadelphia...
Is it male or female?
No, I don't think so.
Is he dead?
Who?
I don't know. I give up!
I give up, too.
Now I ask you another one.
What is it got a big black mustache, smokes a big black cigar, and he's a big pain in the neck?
Don't tell me.
Has a big black mustache, smokes a big black cigar, and is a big pain in the...
Does he wear glasses?
That's right. You guess it quick.
Just for that, you don't get the job I was gonna give you.
What job? Secretary of War!
All right, I take it.
Sold!
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.
Hey, don't go away, I wanna talk to you.
Now, where were we?
Oh, yes!
Now that you're Secretary of War, what kind of an army do you think we oughta have?
Well, I tell you what I think. I think we should have a standing army.
Why should we have a standing army?
Because then we save money on chairs!
Peanuts!
Scat!
Say, who are you anyway?
I don't go in much for modern art.
Have you got anything by one of the Old Masters?
Not bad.
You don't happen to have her telephone number?
Say, you could be a big help to me.
Where do you live?
Well, it's not much of a place, but it's home.
Well, I know one thing,
I bet you haven't got a picture of my grandfather.
Uh-uh! Not now!
Some other time.
Your Excellency?
Quiet!
This letter's the work of Trentino.
The man is trying to undermine you. Now, what are you gonna do about it?
I've got a good mind to ring his doorbell and run.
We've got to get rid of that man at once. I've got a plan.
You say something to make him mad and he'll strike you!
And we'll force him to leave the country.
That's a swell plan. Why couldn't you arrange for me to strike him?
Ambassador Trentino is a very sensitive man. Perhaps if you insult him.
He's very easy to insult.
Why, I said something to Vera Marcal in his presence and he slapped my face.
Why didn't Vera slap your face?
She did.
What'd you say to her?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Where'd you hear that story?
You told it to me.
Oh, yes!
I remember.
I should've slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me.
Where is Trentino?
At Mrs. Teasdale's tea party.
Was I invited?
No. Take a letter!
"You are cordially invited to attend my tea party."
Sign Mrs. Teasdale's name and tell her I accept.
Come on, let's go.
I've got an appointment to insult Ambassador Trentino, and I don't want to keep him waiting!
Step on it!
This is the fifth trip I've made today and I haven't been anywhere yet.
You don't seem to be making much progress with Mrs. Teasdale, huh?
How can I?
Every time I get her in the right mood to say "yes," Firefly pops in.
Well, this is your opportunity. He won't be here today.
Are you sure?
Positive!
I helped Mrs. Teasdale with the invitations. Oh.
His Excellency, Rufus T. Firefly!
Hail, hail Freedonia
Land of the brave and free
Gloria, I waited for years. I can't be put off any longer.
I love you, I want you!
Can't you see I'm at your feet?
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.
If that isn't an insult, I don't know what is.
Gloria, I love you. I realize how lonely you are.
Can't we go someplace where we can be by ourselves?
What can this mug offer you?
Wealth and family?
I can't give you wealth, but we can have a little family of our own.
Oh, Rufus!
All I can offer you is a roof-us over your head.
Your Excellency, I really don't know what to say.
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.
Maybe you can suggest something.
As a matter of fact, you do suggest something. To me you suggest a baboon.
What?
I'm sorry I said that. It isn't fair to the rest of the baboons.
This man's conduct is inexcusable! Gentlemen!
Gentlemen!
I did not come here to be insulted!
That's what you think.
You swine! Come again?
You worm!
Once more.
You upstart!
That's it!
Touche!
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm afraid this regrettable occurrence may plunge our countries into war.
Oh, this is terrible!
I've said enough. I'm a man of few words.
I'm a man of one word. Scram!
A man doesn't live who can call a Firefly an upstart.
Why, the Mayflower was full of Fireflys, and a few horseflies, too.
The Fireflys were on the upper deck and the horseflies were on the Fireflys.
Good day, my sweet.
Oh, Your Excellency, I must speak to you!
I'll see you at the theater tonight. I'll hold your seat till you get there.
After you get there, you're on your own.
His Excellency's car!
His Excellency's car!
No, no, you don't. I'm not taking any more chances.
You can only fool a Firefly twice. This time you ride in the sidecar.
This is the only way to travel.
Hey, Pinky, come here.
Watch the stand. Come on, Pastrami, come on.
Hey!
Hey, what's...
What's the matter?
Mrs. Teasdale.
I deeply regret the unfortunate affair with His Excellency, but his attitude left me no alternative.
Maybe we can still avoid this terrible war.
Oh, if we only could.
Oh, yes, I do...
Ah.
Mrs. Teasdale, I have been recalled by my president.
Then it's too late?
Not if His Excellency will listen to reason.
I am prepared to pocket my pride and forget about the whole matter if he is.
Ambassador, that's wonderful of you, but I'm afraid His Excellency won't hear of it.
Oh, perhaps he will listen to you.
Do you think so?
Yes, of course.
I'll call him.
I hate to disturb you,
I know you're a very busy man, but I must see you at once.
Where are you?
Oh.
Why not come over here?
You can come in the back way.
No one will see you. Well, if you think of it, bring some cheese.
But, Your Excellency, you must come over.
It's a long story. I can't tell it to you over the phone.
Oh, it's that kind of a story.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself. I'll be right over.
He'll be right over. Perhaps you'd better wait outside until I've had a chance to talk to him.
Very well, we'll be out here if you want us.
Oh!
How'd you get in here? Oh, Your Excellency, I'm so sorry to have to disturb you.
Will you ever forgive me?
After I leave here tonight, will you ever forgive me?
Here are the plans of war. They're as valuable as your life and that's putting them pretty cheap.
Watch them like a cat watches her kittens. Have you ever had kittens?
No, of course not. You're too busy running around playing bridge.
Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?
I love you. Why don't you marry me?
Why, marry you?
You take me and I'll take a vacation.
I'll need a vacation if we're going to get married.
Married! I can see you right now in the kitchen, bending over a hot stove, but I can't see the stove.
Come, come! Say the word and you'll never see me again.
Gloria.
Rufus, what are you thinking of?
Oh, I was just thinking of all the years I've wasted collecting stamps.
Oh, I suppose you'll think me a sentimental old fluff, but would you mind giving me a lock of your hair?
A lock of my hair?
Oh, I had no idea...
I'm letting you off easy. I was gonna ask for the whole wig.
So, you've come to ask for clemency?
Your Excellency, the Ambassador's here on a friendly visit. He's had a change of heart.
A lot of good that'll do him.
He's still got the same face. I'm sorry we lost our tempers. I'm willing to forget if you are.
Forget?
You ask me to forget?
A Firefly never forgets.
Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves and I'd only have to bury them again.
Nothing doing.
I'm going back and clean the crackers out of my bed. I'm expecting company.
Please wait.
Let go of me, you bully!
I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
It's too late. I've already paid a month's rent on the battlefield.
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that later.
Won't you reconsider?
Please relent, for my sake.
Well, maybe I am a little headstrong, but I come by it honestly.
My father was a little headstrong. My mother was a little armstrong.
The headstrongs married the armstrongs and that's why darkies were born.
It was silly of me to lose my temper, on account of that little thing you called me.
Little thing I called you?
What did I call you?
Gosh, I don't even remember what it was.
Well, do you mean "worm"?
No, that wasn't it.
I know, "swine." Uh-uh.
No, it was a seven-letter word.
Oh, yes, "upstart"!
That's it. Upstart!
Mrs. Teasdale, this man is impossible.
This is an outrage. My course is clear. This means war!
Oh! You runt!
I still like upstart the best.
I shan't stay here a minute longer.
Go and never darken my towels again!
My hat!
My towel! Oh!
I happen to know, that Freedonia's plans of war are in Mrs. Teasdale's possession.
I must get hold of them.
Yes, but how?
We have a weekend guest in Mrs. Teasdale's house.
Miss Marcal.
Now gentlemen, do you mind waiting for me outside?
I'll join you in a moment.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Yes, I am alone. No, not yet.
But, Vera, we've got to work fast. You must get hold of those plans tonight.
Chicolini and his partner should be there any minute. Do everything you can to help them.
But I must be very careful. There is another guest in here for the weekend.
Firefly. I don't know. I think he is asleep.
Ring the bell.
Push the button.
You got the plans?
No, but they're somewhere in the house, and you must find them.
Oh, for heaven's sake, whatever you do, don't make a sound.
If you're found, you're lost.
Oh, you crazy, how can I be lost if I'm found?
Got a flashlight?
You don't know how serious this is.
If they catch you, you'll be court-martialed and shot.
Oh, Vera!
I must go before she looks for me.
Now remember, whatever you do, don't make a sound.
You stay here, but keep quiet.
Remember what she said, if we get caught, we're gonna get, uh, court-plastered.
Your Excellency, I'm worried. I can't sleep.
What?
You're worried?
You can't sleep?
That's fine, now you woke me up. Now I can't sleep.
It's about those plans. I won't rest until they're back in your hands.
Won't you please come over and get them?
Oh, the plans. Okay, I'll be right over.
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me outta here!
Hey, let me outta here or throw me a magazine.
So that's your game, eh?
I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your door in.
Come in.
Oh, Your Excellency, I'm so glad you've come.
I'm glad I come, too. You got the plans?
Why, Your Excellency, you sound so strange. Why are you talking like that?
Oh, well, you see, maybe some time I go to Italy and I'm practicing the language.
I'll see my lawyer about this as soon as he graduates from law school.
Your dialect is perfect. I could listen to you all night.
That's all right, but I can't stay here all night.
Where's the plans?
They're in the safe downstairs.
I'll write out the combination.
Oh, there you are. Here's the combination.
Is that clear?
Is there anything else you want to know?
What's the matter with you?
Have you lost your voice?
Let me get you a glass of water, Your Excellency.
Your Excellency, here's your water.
What in the world is the matter with you?
Your Excellency! I thought you left.
Oh, no, I no leave.
But I saw you with my own eyes.
Well, who you gonna believe, me or your own eyes? Oh.
Your Excellency, I'm sorry, but this excitement's too much for me.
I feel faint.
Wait, I get you a glass of water.
How about my glass of water?
I give up. How about your glass of water?
What's that?
Sounds to me like mice.
Mice?
Mice don't play music.
No?
How about the old maestro? Oh.
Get me headquarters. Not hindquarters, headquarters.
Hello?
Rush the guards right over to Mrs. Teasdale's and have them surround the house.
His Excellency, Rufus T. Firefly.
Hail, hail Freedonia
Land of the brave and free
Lieutenant!
Why weren't the original indictment papers placed on my portfolio?
Why, uh, I didn't think those papers were important at this time, Your Excellency.
You didn't think they were important?
You realize I had my dessert wrapped in those papers?
Here, take this bottle back and get two cents for it.
Hello, boss.
Chicolini, I bet you eight to one, we find you guilty.
That's a no good. I can get 10 to one at the barbershop.
Chicolini, you're charged with high treason. And if found guilty, you'll be shot.
I object.
Oh, you object.
On what grounds?
I couldn't think of anything else to say.
Objection sustained.
Your Excellency, you sustained the objection?
Sure, I couldn't think of anything else to say either. Why don't you object?
Chicolini, when were you born?
I don't remember. I was just a little baby.
Isn't it true you tried to sell Freedonia's secret war code and plans?
Sure, I sold a code and two pair of plans.
It's some joke, eh, boss?
Now I'll bet you 20 to one we find you guilty.
Chicolini, have you anyone here to defend you?
It's no use.
I even offered to pay as high as $18, but I no could get somebody to defend me.
My friends, this man's case moves me deeply.
Look at Chicolini, he sits there alone.
An abject figure.
I abject!
I say, look at Chicolini, he sits there alone, a pitiable object.
Let's see you get out of that one. Surrounded by a sea of unfriendly faces.
Chicolini, give me a number from one to 10.
Eleven.
Right!
Now I ask you one. What is it has a trunk, but no key, weighs 2,000 pounds and lives in a circus?
That's irrelevant.
Irrelephant?
Hey, that's the answer. There's a whole lot of irrelephants in a circus.
That sort of testimony we can eliminate.
That's fine, I'll take some.
You'll take what?
A lemonade, a nice, cold glass of lemonade.
Hey, boss, I'm going good.
Gentlemen, Chicolini here may talk like an idiot and look like an idiot.
But don't let that fool you. He really is an idiot.
I implore you, send him back to his father and brothers who are waiting for him with open arms in the penitentiary.
I suggest that we give him 10 years in Leavenworth or 11 years in Twelveworth.
I tell you what I'll do. I'll take five and 10 in Woolworth.
I wanted to get a writ of habeas corpus, but I should have gotten rid of you instead.
I object.
Even I object.
Then I object, too.
You're on trial, you can't object.
Your Excellency,
General Cooper says that the Sylvanian troops are about to land on Freedonian soil.
This means war.
Something must be done.
War would mean a prohibitive increase in our taxes.
Hey, I got an uncle lives in Texas.
No, I'm talking about taxes, money, dollars.
Dallas!
That's where my uncle lives, Dallas, Texas!
More bad news.
Didn't I tell you?
Your Excellency.
What's on your mind, babe?
In behalf of the women of Freedonia,
I have taken it upon myself to make one final effort to prevent war.
No kidding?
I've talked to Ambassador Trentino, and he says Sylvania doesn't want war either.
Either.
Doesn't want war either.
Either. Skip it.
I've taken the liberty of asking the Ambassador to come over here.
Because we both felt that a friendly conference would settle everything peacefully.
He'll be here any moment.
Mrs. Teasdale, you did a noble deed.
I'd be unworthy of the high trust that's been placed in me if I didn't do everything within my power to keep our beloved Freedonia at peace with the world.
I'd be only too happy to meet Ambassador Trentino and offer him on behalf of my country the right hand of good fellowship.
And I feel sure that he will accept this gesture in the spirit in which it is offered.
But suppose he doesn't. A fine thing that'll be.
I hold out my hand and he refuses to accept it.
That'll add a lot to my prestige, won't it?
Me, the head of a country, snubbed by a foreign ambassador.
Who does he think he is that he can come here and make a sap out of me in front of all my people?
Think of it.
I hold out my hand and that hyena refuses to accept it.
Why the cheap four-flushing swine.
He'll never get away with it, I tell you.
He'll never get away with it!
Oh, please! So, you refuse to shake hands with me, eh? Oh!
Mrs. Teasdale, this is the last straw.
There's no turning back now!
This means war!
Then it's war!
Then it's war!
Gather the forces!
Harness the horses!
Then it's war!
Freedonia's going to war
Each native son will grab a gun
And run away to war
At last we're going to...
Feet will beat along the street to war
We're going to war
At last our country's going to war
It seems our country's going to war
At last the country's going to war
We're going to war This is a fact we can't ignore
We're going to war This is a fact we can't ignore We're going to war
In case you haven't heard before I think they think we're going to war I think they think we're going to war
We're going to war I think they think we're going to war
We're going to war We're going to war
We're going to war
We're going to war
To war, to war We're finally going to war
To war, to war To war we're gonna go
Oh-ho They got guns We got guns
All God's children got guns
We're gonna walk all over the battlefield
'Cause all God's children got guns
Oh, Freedonia Oh, don't you cry for me
'Cause I'm coming 'round the mountain with a banjo on my knee
Oh, Freedonia Oh, don't you cry for me
'Cause I'm coming 'round the mountain
With a banjo
On my
To war, to war To war we're gonna go
To war, to war, to war
To war, to war We soon will say goodbye
Oh, how we'd cry for Firefly if Firefly should die
A mighty man is he
A man of brawn who'll carry on till dawn of victory
With him to lead the way our spirits will not lag
Until the Judgment Day we'll rally round the flag
The flag, the flag, the flag
The enemy is coming!
There'll be two lamps in the steeple if they're coming by land and one if they're coming by sea.
They double-crossed me. They're coming by land and sea.
Ride through every village and town!
Wake every citizen uphill and down!
Tell them the enemy comes from afar. With a hey-nonny-nonny and a ha-cha-cha
Be off, my lad!
My husband!
Quickly!
Hide in there.
Oh, don't.
Freedonia's going to war.
I'm gonna take a bath.
Clear all wires. The enemy has captured Hill 27 and 28.
Throwing 13 hillbillies out of work.
Last night, two snipers crept into our machine gun nest and laid an egg.
Send reinforcements immediately. Send that off collect.
Your Excellency, our men are being badly beaten in open warfare.
I suggest we dig trenches.
Dig trenches with our men being killed off like flies? There isn't time to dig trenches.
We'll buy ready-made. Here, run out and get some trenches.
Yes, sir.
Wait a minute, get them this high and our soldiers won't need any pants.
Yes, sir.
Wait a minute, get them this high and we won't need any soldiers.
Yes, sir.
Chicolini, your partner's deserted us, but I'm still counting on you.
There's a machine gun nest near Hill 28. I want it cleaned out.
All right, I'll tell the janitor.
Message from the front, sir.
Oh, I'm sick of messages from the front. Don't we ever get a message from the side?
What is it?
General Smith reports a gas attack. He wants to know what to do.
Tell him to take a teaspoonful of bicarbonate soda and a half a glass of water.
Yes, sir.
Any answer to that message?
No, sir. Well, in that case, don't send that.
Gentlemen, this is the last straw.
Where's my Stradivarius?
Here, sir.
I'll show them they can't fiddle around with old Firefly.
Look at them run. Now they know they've been in a war.
Your Excellency!
They're fleeing like rats. But, sir, I've got to tell...
Remind me to give myself the Firefly Medal for this.
Your Excellency, you're shooting your own men.
What?
You're shooting your own men!
Here's $5. Keep it under your hat. Never mind.
Now we've got to have more men or we're lost.
Don't be alarmed, I've got a man combing the countryside for volunteers.
Your Excellency, the army's morale is crumbling. The men are breaking ranks.
Where's the Secretary of War?
That's it!
Where is the Secretary of War?
The soldiers are waiting for his orders.
His Excellency, the Secretary of War.
Awfully decent of you to drop in today.
You realize our army is facing disastrous defeat?
What do you intend to do about it?
I've done it already.
You've done what?
I've changed to the other side.
So you're on the other side, eh?
Well, what are you doing over here?
Well, the food is better over here.
Chicolini, I need you badly right now.
What'll you take to come back and work for me again?
I'll take a vacation.
Good, you're hired.
Now, go out in that battlefield and lead those men to victory.
Go on, they're waiting for you.
I wouldn't go out there unless I was in one of those big iron things that go up and down like this.
What do you call those things? Tanks.
You're welcome.
Your Excellency, you must come over here at once. There's danger here.
Why don't you come over here?
There's no danger here.
Shh! Rufus.
Wait a minute, I want to find out something.
Just as I thought, the coast is clear.
Rufus! Chicolini, to your post! Oh!
Remember, you're fighting for this woman's honor which is probably more than she ever did.
Your Excellency!
There goes my gun. Run out and get that like a good girl.
Oh, I'm afraid!
We can't last much longer. Our ammunition supplies are very low.
Man the boats, Lieutenant!
I'll get help.
Calling all nations!
Calling all nations!
This is Rufus T...
This is Rufus T. Firefly, coming to you through the courtesy of the enemy.
We're in a mess, folks!
We're in a mess!
Rush to Freedonia. Three men and one woman are trapped in a building.
Send help at once. If you can't send help, send two more women.
Make it three more women.
Your Excellency, we can't hold out much longer.
One of us has got to break through the lines and get word to General Cooper and his men.
Quiet back there!
Which one of us is gonna have the rare privilege of sacrificing his life for his country?
We draw lots.
Wait!
I got it.
I did it wrong. Wait, wait, wait, I start here.
Harem-scarem, merchan-tarem, teir, tore... That's no good, too. Oh, I got it.
Buck! You're a brave man. Go and break through the lines!
And remember, while you're out there risking life and limb through shot and shell, we'll be in here thinking what a sucker you are.
Goodbye, Mont Blanc, goodbye.
For Freedonia! For Freedonia!
For Freedonia!
Gloria!
Gloria!
Where did they get you? Oh!
Hey, careful with the water.
It's the only water we got.
Well, it's the only woman we got.
We're surrounded!
They're attacking from the rear.
They're coming this way.
We'll barricade the door.
This is Firefly talking!
Send help at once!
Help is on the way!
Carry on, men!
Help is on the way!
They got me. They got me. Water!
Water!
- Get me out of this!
- Get me out of this!
The last time this happened to me I was crawling under a bed.
Oh, if help would only come.
Your Excellency!
Any mail for me while I was gone?
Oh, don't touch me! Get away from me!
Hey, Trentino!
Trentino, eh?
That's game.
Trentino!
Trentino, eh?
Call me an upstart, eh?
I surrender!
I surrender!
I'm sorry, you'll have to wait until the fruit runs out.
Victory is ours!
Hail, hail Freedonia
Land of the brave
Say, is this the moving-picture ship?
The Venture?
Yeah.
- Are you going on this crazy voyage?
- What's crazy about it?
I don't know. But everybody is talking about that crazy fella running it.
- Carl Denham?
- Guess that's the name.
He ain't scared of nothing.
If he wants a picture of lion  he just goes up to him and tells him to look pleasant.
He's a tough egg. Why all this talk about this voyage being crazy?
Everybody around the docks is talking about the cargo, for one thing.
And I never did see a ship this size with such a crew.
- Not enough men to handle her?
- Not enough!
Three times more than the ship needs.
I don't see where they're gonna have room enough to sleep.
Hey, down there. What do you want?
- Denham aboard?
- Who are you?
My name is Weston, the theatrical agent.
Well, why didn't you say so?
Come on aboard.
Denham's getting wild. I hope you've got some good news for him.
Well, Mr. Denham, you know the reasons for hurrying as well as I do.
Insurance company found out we're carrying explosives.
Marshal will be aboard tomorrow or next day.
If we make a legal case of it, we'll be tied up for months?
With enough ammunition to blow up the harbor.
What do you think the marshal will say to these new gas bombs of yours?
According to you, one of them is enough to knock out an elephant.
We've got to get where we're going before the monsoon starts.
- Trust me to see you through a blow.
- Oh, now, don't get sore, skipper.
You can't run into the rainy season when you're trying to make an outdoor picture.
Months wasted, money gone and nothing to show.
Still you always bring back a picture.
And everybody says, "There's only one Carl Denham. "
Weston, I was just going ashore to call you.
If I'd known that, I would have waited.
This is the skipper. Weston, the theatrical agent.
I guess you met Driscoll, the first mate.
Well, Weston, how about the girl?
- It can't be done, Denham.
- What?
It's got to be done. Now, look here, Weston.
Somebody's interfered with every girl I try to hire.
Now all the agents in town have shut down on me. All but you.
- You know I'm square.
- Everybody knows you're square.
But you've got a reputation for recklessness  that can't be glossed over.
Then you're so secretive.
You said it.
Even skipper and mate don't know where they're going, what.
There you are. I've got a conscience, Denham.
I can't send a pretty girl such as you ask on a job like this  without telling her what to expect.
- What is she to expect?
To go off on a trip for no one knows how long  to some spot you don't even hint at  the only woman on a ship with the toughest mugs I ever looked at.
I mean the crew.
Good Lord, you talk as if I never brought anybody back alive.
The skipper and Driscoll have stuck to me on two trips.
- They look well enough.
- Sure, we're healthy.
But it's a different thing taking a girl into danger.
I suppose there's no danger in New York.
Listen, there are dozens of girls in this town  that are in more danger than they are with me.
Yeah, but they know that kind of danger.
You never had a woman in any of your pictures.
- Why do you want one? - Holy mackerel!
Do you think I wanna haul a woman around?
- Then why?
- Because the public, bless them  must have a pretty face.
Sure, everybody likes romance.
Isn't there any romance or adventure without having a flapper in it?
Well, Mr. Denham, why not take a picture in a monastery?
Makes me sore. I go out, sweat blood to make a swell picture  then the critics and the exhibitors all say:
"If this picture had love interest, it would gross twice as much. "
The public wants a girl, and this time I'm gonna give what they want.
- Don't know where you'll get her.
- I've gotta get her, Weston.
We've gotta leave by morning.
- We've gotta be gone by daylight.
- Why?
Well, there's a good reason.
Everything I hear about it makes me like it less.
I'm glad I didn't get you a girl.
You are, eh?
Well, I'll show you.
Do you think I'm gonna give up because you can't find me a girl?
I'm going to make the greatest picture in the world.
Something that nobody's ever seen or heard of.
They'll have to think up a lot of new adjectives when I come back.
- Where you going?
- Going out  and get a girl for my picture.
Even if I have to marry one.
- Stand aside, please. Get your case later.
- Can I take my things?
Say, lay off the shoving, will you?
- Oh, I didn't mean to shove you.
- Excuse me.
What do they give you in this joint?
Soup tonight. Coffee and sinkers in the morning.
I catch you, you stealer. Now, I get you cop. You like that, huh?
No, no. I didn't. Let me go.
- Had enough of these stealers.
- Dry up. Kid didn't take any.
- Truly I didn't.
- Three people this week...
- Here... Here's a buck.
- A buck.
Scram.
Hey, taxi!
Feeling better?
Yes, thank you.
- You're very kind.
- Don't you fool yourself.
I'm not bothering about you just out of kindness.
- How'd you ever get into this fix?
- Bad luck, I guess.
There are a lot of girls like me.
- Not many with your looks.
- I can get by in good clothes all right.
- But when a girl gets too shabby...
- No family?
Supposed to have an uncle someplace.
Did you ever do any acting?
I used to do extra work now and then over on Long Island.
The studio's closed now.
- What's your name?
- Ann Darrow.
Fine. I've got a job for you.
Costumes on the ship will fit you.
If the shops are still open, I can get clothes for you.
- Come on.
- But...
- But what is it? - It's money and adventure and fame.
It's the thrill of a lifetime.
A long sea voyage  that starts at 6:00 tomorrow morning.
No, wait.
I don't understand. You must tell me.
I do want the job so  but I can't.
No, you've got me wrong. This is strictly business.
- I only wanted... - Sure.
Sure you did.
I got a little excited and I forgot you didn't understand.
Listen, I'm Carl Denham. Ever heard of me?
Yes, yes. You make moving pictures in jungles and places.
That's right. And I pick you as lead in my next picture.
We sail at 6.
- Where to?
- A long way off.
And listen, Ann, I'm on the level. No funny business.
- What do I have to do?
- Just trust me and keep your chin up.
Hey, you men on that winch  down below on the deck and help with these hatches.
Hurry this line forward.
Forward, you farmer and up here!
What are you doing up here?
- I just wanted to see.
- Oh, you just wanted to see.
Well, I'm sorry. Make that line fast!
You're that girl Denham picked, aren't you? Yes.
I think this is awfully exciting. I've never been on a ship before.
I've never been on one with a woman before.
I guess you don't think much of women on ships?
No, they're a nuisance.
- I'll try not to be.
- You've been in the way already.
Bring that ladder aboard!
Well, you better stay below.
What?
The whole voyage?
I'm afraid I didn't apologize for hitting you.
That was a pretty tough rap on the chin.
- Well, we're off.
- We're off.
Say, how many potatoes do you think you've peeled in six weeks?
Too many.
Sailors eat an awful lot, don't they?
All time eat. Someday me go back China.
Never see no more potatoes.
- Charlie, isn't the ocean wonderful?
- Very pretty.
Pretty soon you be all same sailor, only no eat so much.
I'd like to be. Only, of course, it wasn't so nice up north  when it was cold and rough was it?
Ocean very nice when you order weather or some eggs for breakfast.
- Hello, Ann.
- Hello, Jack.
Where you been all morning?
Trying on costumes for Mr. Denham.
He's gonna make some tests of me here on deck  if the light is right.
- Tests, why?
Oh, to see which side of my face looks best and all that.
Both sides look all right to me.
Yes, but you're not the movie director.
If I was, you wouldn't be here.
Well, is that a nice thing to say.
This is no place for a girl.
You can't say I've been one bit of trouble to anyone  have I? I wish you wouldn't keep harping on that. It's very mean of you.
Anybody would think I'd been a lot of trouble.
I haven't. - Sure you have.
Sure you have.
- I don't see...
Well, how?
Just...
Just being around is trouble.
Oh, dear, and I thought everything was going so nicely.
Oh, you're all right.
But women just can't help being a bother.
- Made that way I guess.
- Well, anyhow...
I've had the happiest time of my life on this old ship.
That's... That's fine.
Say...
Did you really mean that, Ann?
Of course. Everyone's so nice to me. Dr. Denham and the skipper...
Don't you think the skipper is a sweet old lamb?
I'd hate to have him hear me say that.
Iggy's nice to me.
Iggy likes me better than he likes anybody onboard.
Don't you, Iggy?
- That's right. Of course you do.
- Beauty and the beast, eh?
Well, now, I never thought I was good-Iooking.
Put on one of the costumes. The light's right for those tests now.
All right, Mr. Denham. I won't be a minute.
Beauty and the beast.
Mr. Denham  I'm gonna do some butting in.
- What's your trouble?
- When do we find out  where we're going?
- Pretty soon.
Will you tell us what happens after?
How can I?
I'm not a fortuneteller.
You must have some idea what you're after.
What's the matter?
You going soft.
Oh, you know I'm not.
Not for myself.
- For Ann.
- Oh, you have gone soft on her, eh?
I've got enough troubles without a love affair to complicate things.
- Better cut it out, Jack.
- Love affair.
- Think I'm gonna fall for any dame?
- I never knew it to fail.
Some big hard-boiled egg gets a look at a pretty face, bang  he cracks up, gets sappy.
- Who's going sappy?
I haven't run out on you? No.
You're a pretty tough guy.
But if beauty gets you, you...
I'm going right into a theme song here.
- Say, what are you talking about?
- It's the idea of my picture.
The beast was a tough guy too.
He could lick the world, but when he saw beauty, she got him.
He went soft, he forgot his wisdom and the little fellas licked him.
Think it over, Jack.
Mr. Denham, skipper wants you up on the bridge.
- He says we've reached the position. - Good.
Come on, Jack.
You're in on this. I'm gonna spill it.
There's our noon position. Two south, 90 east.
Now, you promised some information when we got here.
- Way west of Sumatra.
- And way out of any waters I know.
I know the East Indies like I do my own hand  but I've never been here.
- Where do we go from here?
- Southwest.
- Southwest?
Well, there is nothing for thousands of miles.
Keep your shirt on, skipper. We're not going thousands of miles.
Here's the island we're looking for.
Well, that position. Let's have the big chart.
You won't find that island on any chart.
That was made by the skipper of a Norwegian bark.
- He must have been kidding.
- No, he wasn't.
Listen, a canoe full of natives from this island was blown to sea.
When the bark picked them, there was one alive.
He died before they reached port, not before the skipper  had a description of the island and got an idea of where it lies.
- Where did you get it?
- Singapore, two years ago.
Skipper knew I'd be interested.
- Does he believe it?
- I don't know. But I do.
Here. Here's what the island looks like.
There's a long, sandy peninsula.
The only possible landing place is through this reef.
Rest of shoreline's sheer precipice, hundreds of feet high.
And across the base of the peninsula, cutting it off  from the rest of the island, is a wall.
- A wall?
- Built long ago.
People who lived there  slipped back, forgotten the high civilization that built it.
That wall is as strong today as it was centuries ago.
The natives keep that wall in repair.
- They need it.
- Why?
There's something on the other side of it.
Something they fear.
A hostile tribe.
Did you ever hear of Kong?
Why, yes.
Some native superstition, isn't it?
A god or a spirit or something.
Well, anyway, neither beast nor man  something monstrous, all-powerful.
Still living  still holding that island in a grip of deadly fear.
Well, every legend has a basis of truth.
I tell you, there's something on that island that no white man has ever seen.
- And you expect to photograph it?
- If it's there, you bet I'll photograph it.
Suppose it doesn't like having its picture taken?
Well, now you know why I brought along those cases of gas bombs.
Oh, you've put on a beauty-and-beast costume, eh?
It's the prettiest.
All right. Just stand right over there.
I'm sort of nervous. Suppose I don't photograph well?
You don't have to worry about that.
If I hadn't been sure  I wouldn't have brought you around the world.
- What will I do?
- Well, we start with the profile.
When I start cranking  why, hold it a minute, and then turn slowly toward me.
You see me. You smile a little, then you listen.
Then you laugh. All right.
Camera.
- Looks kind of silly, don't it?
- Pretty dame, huh?
You think maybe he like to take my picture?
Them cameras cost money. Shouldn't think he'd risk it.
Now, that's fine, Ann. Now we'll try one with a filter, eh?
Do you always take the pictures yourself?
Ever since a trip I made to Africa.
I'd have got a swell picture of a charging rhino  but the cameraman got scared.
The darned fool. I was right there with a rifle.
Seems he didn't trust me to get the rhino before it got him.
I haven't fooled with a cameramen since. I do it myself.
- Think he's crazy, skipper?
- Just enthusiastic.
Ann, in this one you're looking down.
When I start to crank, you look up slowly.
You're quite calm. You don't expect to see a thing.
Then you just follow my directions. All right?
Camera. Look up slowly, Ann.
That's it. You don't see anything.
Now look higher  still higher.
Now you see it. You're amazed.
You can't believe it. Your eyes open wider.
It's horrible, Ann, but you can't look away.
There's no chance for you, Ann, no escape.
You're helpless, Ann, helpless.
There's just one chance, if you can scream  but your throat's paralyzed.
Try to scream, Ann, try.
Perhaps if you didn't see it, you could scream.
Throw your arm across your eyes and scream. Scream for your life.
What's he think she's really gonna see?
This infernal fog. Sure of your position, skipper?
Last night before this fog shut down, I got a good sight.
We should be near the island.
If we don't see it when this fog lifts, we never will.
We've quartered these parts.
Can't see your hand in front of your face.
Hey, Charlie, I wish you'd make your soup as thick as this.
No bottom at 30.
The Norwegian skipper must've been guessing at the position.
How will we know it's the right island?
- The mountain that looks like a skull.
- Oh, yes, I'd forgotten. You told me.
- Skull Mountain.
- By the deep 20.
Shallowing fast. Mr. Briggs, dead slow.
Dead slow, sir.
- Confound this fog.
- By the deep 16.
- What'd she draw, skipper? - Four.
Why don't he heave to until it clears?
'Tain't the old man. It's that crazy guy, Denham.
Listen, you hear anything?
No.
- Breakers ahead.
- Let go.
That's not breakers. That's drums.
Skipper, now the fog's lifted, do you see anybody?
- Not a living thing.
- Funny they haven't spotted us.
I'd think the whole population would be on the beach.
Listen.
Maybe they have spotted us and are signaling.
Well, skipper, do you believe me now? There it is.
Skull Mountain, the wall.
Everything just like on my funny little map.
- Come on. Let's get started.
- All right.
Twelve men go with you. The rest stay aboard.
Have you got a good man with those gas bombs?
I think you better go along.
You may be able to talk to these birds.
All right. Mr. Adams.
Aye, sir.
- You'll take charge of the ship.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- I'm going ashore with you, aren't I?
- You bet.
I don't think she should until we know what's there.
Wait a minute. Who's running this show?
I found out from experience to keep my cast and cameras with me.
You never can tell when you'll want them.
- But you're crazy to risk...
- Jack  run along and get the rifles and ammunition.
And get me a couple of huskies to carry my stuff.
And, Jack, don't forget the costume box.
If we're lucky enough, we may get a swell shot right away.
Come on, Ann.
All right, boys, let's go.
- Take it easy with that camera.
- Okay.
- Plenty of ammunition for those guns?
- Yes, sir.
Be careful with those bombs.
All right, Briggs, now we'll get a look at Denham's island.
Stand by to lower away.
You with the camera, stick close.
- Okay.
- Who's got the bombs?
- I have, sir.
- Watch your step.
There's enough trichloride to put hippos to sleep.
Aye, aye, sir.
- What queer-Iooking boats.
- Yeah, outrigger canoes.
Driscoll, I want two men left here to guard the boat.
- All attended to, sir.
- Good.
We all ready, then? Come on.
Not a soul in sight.
The people must all be gathered up ahead.
That wall, skipper. What do you think of that?
Colossal. It might almost be Egyptian.
But what's on the other side of that wall? I wanna know.
Who do you suppose could have built it?
Oh, I was up on Angkor once.
That's bigger than this, and nobody knows who built it.
Oh, boy, what a chance. What a picture.
Come on.
Hear that? They're saying, "Kong, Kong. "
Hope you talk their lingo, skipper.
- You catch any words yet?
- I'm not sure.
Sounds something like the language Nias Islanders speak.
What do you suppose is happening?
They're up to some of their heathen tricks.
But don't go rushing out to sea.
- All right. But isn't it exciting?
- Sure.
- I wish we'd left you on the ship.
- Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.
Wait. Easy, now. Wait till I see what goes on.
Holy mackerel! What a show.
Hey, skipper, come here and get a load of this.
Did you ever see anything like that before in your life?
Boy, if I could only get a picture before they see us.
Hey, you with the camera. Come here.
I wanna see.
Come on, but be careful.
- Too late. They see us. - Let's...
Let's beat it.
- Hey, what are you running for?
- No use trying to hide now.
Everybody come out in plain sight.
- Say, let's scram out of here.
- Stand still, you fool.
Steady, boys, bluff them.
Come on, skipper. Make him a friendly speech.
He understands you, skipper. What's he say?
- He's telling us to get out.
- Well, talk him out of it.
Ask him what goes on.
He says the girl there is the bride of Kong.
Great. Find out what they're gonna do.
- What's that?
- He must be the witch doctor.
He says the ceremony is spoiled because we've seen it.
Well, calm the old boy down. What's the word for friend?
Steady with those rifles, boys.
- What's that?
- He says, look at the golden woman.
Yeah. Blonds are scarce around here.
- A gift for Kong, he says.
- Good Lord!
Wants to buy her.
He's offering to trade six of his women for Ann.
You got her into this, Denham.
I'm gonna take her back to the ship.
We'd better get out of here before they think to cut us off.
Guess so. But tell him we'll be back tomorrow to make friends.
Get going, Ann. Don't be scared. Everything's all right.
Smile, Ann, and talk to Jack.
Keep your chin up.
- Say, why aren't you in bed?
- Oh, I can't sleep.
The sound of those drums makes me nervous, I guess.
I think Denham's off his nut taking you ashore today.
Well, I was a little scared.
- I guess you weren't the only one.
- I wonder what we do next.
That's just what's worrying me.
Denham's a fool, there's no telling what he might  ask you to do for this picture.
After all he's done, I would take any chance for him.
Don't talk like that.
I'd say he's crazy enough to try anything.
Well, I won't go back on him.
When I think of what might've happened today, if anything had happened to you...
Then you wouldn't be bothered having a woman onboard.
Don't laugh. I'm scared for you.
I'm sort of...
Well, I'm scared of you too.
Ann...
I...
Say...
I guess I love you.
Why, Jack, you hate women.
Yeah, I know. But you aren't women.
Say, Ann...
I don't suppose...
I mean...
Well, you don't feel anything like that about me  do you?
Mr. Driscoll, are you on deck?
Yes, sir.
Will you please come up on the bridge?
You go on. I'll wait here.
Yes, sir.
There, that's about it.
We'll make absolutely sure tomorrow noon.
Oh, must be almost midnight.
Hey.
Look at that.
Torches going through the village.
Yeah, looks like the night before election.
Listen to them. Wonder what's up.
Wish I could take pictures by firelight.
- I'd sneak ashore and get a scene now.
- Oh, be sensible.
We're lucky to be all safe aboard tonight.
Yeah, I guess so.
- Charlie, have you seen missy?
- Me no see one, two hours.
When we leave this place?
Me no like.
Ann.
Ann.
All hands on deck! Everybody on deck!
Everybody on deck! All hands on deck!
Everybody on deck! Everybody on deck!
- What's the matter? What's happening?
- What's going on?
- What's the matter?
- I'm out here.
Look, sir. Me find on deck.
- A native bracelet.
- Crazy black man been here.
What is it?
Who turned out the crew? - Look.
Someone's been aboard.
- Where's Ann?
- In her cabin. - No, she isn't.
I just looked.
- What's the matter, Mr. Driscoll?
- Search the ship. Find Miss Darrow.
Aye, aye.
- Ann. Oh, Ann. Did you see her?
- No.
I'll look below.
- Did you find her?
- Can't find her forward.
- She's not below.
- Can't find her aft.
Ann's gone!
Serve out the rifles. Man the boats.
Take this ammunition outside.
Come on, you fellas. Grab these guns.
Take these bomb cases and be careful with them.
Pass those rifles up over the side.
Start packing those bombs.
Me likey go too. Me likey catch missy.
This is no job for a cook. Get out of here. Come on.
Shove her off, men. We're going over the side.
Give way, gentlemen. Right over there.
They've taken Ann.
Hurry. Hurry up. She must be up ahead here.
- Come on, men.
- Come on, boys.
Has anybody seen her? Come on.
Get this gate open. Quick!
Get up there, men. Pull that thing back!
Pull that bar back. He's got Ann.
Heave. Heave.
Heave. Heave.
- Who's going with me? - I'll go.
You stay with half the men and guard the gate.
- Don't let them close it.
- We'll take care of it.
No telling which way he went in this darkness.
He's been through here.
- Look at these broken branches.
- Yeah, look at that. Keep up, fellas.
It ought to be sunup about now.
Yeah, just listen to those birds.
It's dawn all right.
- What's that? - Holy mackerel!
Yeah, that's his track.
Look at the size of that thing.
He must be as big as a house.
He's headed this way.
Come on, fellas, and keep those guns cocked.
Hate to have that thing wrapped around me.
Here's another one. We're on his trail.
Sure, sure. I know that. Come on.
Hey, look at that!
Keep quiet. He doesn't see us.
Give me one of those bombs.
Look, it's gonna charge.
Keep quiet.
Come on.
Give him another one.
Look out!
Look out. He's still alive.
Shoot.
Come on. That got him.
What do you call this thing?
Why, something from the dinosaur family.
Dinosaur, eh?
Yes, Jack  a prehistoric beast.
Say, just look at the length of that brute.
If I could only bring back one of these alive.
- Watch that tail! He's still alive.
- Come on, looks like he's standing up.
He's through. Come on.
Come on, men.
Boy, one swipe of that.
- Hear that? - Yeah.
What is it?
That's him, boys. Come on.
Here. Here's his mark again.
- There's water ahead.
- He's down in that fog somewhere.
Yes, that's him splashing through. Come on.
Be careful.
Now, watch the step-off, boys.
Must have swum across.
Yeah, it'll be tough for us with these guns and bombs.
- What about these logs for a raft? - Good idea.
Come, fellas.
Get busy.
Put those guns down on the bank and get going.
Move!
Come on with those poles.
All set, everybody?
Shove off!
- Hear anything?
- No, he's miles away by now.
We'll be able to pick up his trail all right.
Listen.
Quiet.
What was it?
Hang on, men.
Look out. Here he comes.
Come on.
Come on.
Hey, Jack. Jack Driscoll.
- Hey, Jack.
- Denham.
- It didn't get you, huh?
- No, I got to cover, same as you.
- Think we're safe?
- There are two of us  left alive to save her.
- I can't get across now.
Don't want you to. Lam back and get more bombs.
Why, you wouldn't follow that beast alone.
Someone's gotta stay on his trail.
I'll get a chance, sneak her away.
I'll figure a way to signal you where he's taken her.
- I guess that's our only out. - Sure it is.
Get going.
Don't get killed till you see Englehorn.
Okay, Jack. Good luck.
Skipper, this Kong is the biggest thing in the world.
He shook those men off that log like they were flies.
All those men lost. It's incredible.
Driscoll said he'd try and signal us if he found Ann.
- We'll never see them again.
- Don't give up.
- There's chance for Driscoll.
- Wait for daylight.
We'll bridge the ravine. Where's that case of bombs?
- Here, sir.
- This...
This monster you've seen, you think your bombs will stop him?
If we can get close enough to use them, you bet they'll stop him.
- Had any trouble with the natives?
- Yes, after you left.
- What happened?
- We fired volleys over  their heads, they ran like rabbits.
Gunpowder's new in their lives?
- They're terrified.
- They haven't shown up.
Take a man on the wall, keep your eyes peeled.
We leave at dawn, if we get a signal or not.
Yes, sir.
Hey, look.
Hey, below, Mr. Denham. Captain Englehorn.
Mr. Driscoll and the lady, they're coming back.
Come on, fellas.
Are you both all right?
Pint, Jack. Here.
I'm all right.
What happened? How did you do it?
- Came down the river.
- Oh, Jack.
There, there, you're safe now.
We'll have you back on the ship in no time.
Wait a minute. What about Kong?
Well, what about him?
We came to get a movie, and we found something worth  more than all the movies in the world.
- What?
We've got those gas bombs.
- If we can capture him alive...
- Why, you're crazy.
He's on a cliff where a whole army  couldn't get at him.
- Yeah, if he stays there  but we've got something he wants.
Yeah, something he won't get again.
Hey, look out. It's Kong. Kong's coming.
Come around. Come here and hold the gates. Quick.
- Denham, natives are coming.
- Good work. Come on.
Hey, come back with those bombs, you...
Come on. Come on. I got him.
He'll be out for hours. Send to the ship.
- For anchor chains and tools.
- What will you do?
A raft to float him to the ship. The whole world will pay to see this.
- No chains will hold that.
- We'll give him more than chains.
He's always been king of his world, but we'll teach him fear.
We're millionaires, boys. I'll share it with all of you.
In a few months, it'll be up in lights on Broadway:
"Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World. "
Say, what's Denham got anyway?
It better be good after all this ballyhoo.
Heavens, what a mob.
Well, you would come. These tickets cost me 20 bucks.
I can't sit so near the screen. It hurts my eyes.
This is not a moving picture, madam.
What?
Mr. Denham makes those pictures  of those darling monkeys and tigers and things.
This is in the nature of a personal appearance.
Well, I never. I thought I was gonna see something.
- Say, what is it anyhow?
- I hear it's a kind of a gorilla.
Gee, ain't we got enough of them in New York?
I don't like to look at him.
It makes me think of that awful day on the island.
I wouldn't have brought you, but you know how Denham insisted.
We had to come when he said it would help the show.
Do you think we'll make a lot of money?
Well, enough to pay him back for these clothes anyway.
It's the first time I ever had on one of these open-front suits.
Hello, there. Just in time. Gee, Ann, you look great.
I'm glad I dressed you up for this show.
Well, Jack, $ 10,000 in the box office.
- Not bad for one night.
- That's a lot of money.
We're gonna do that every night.
- Look at the size of that.
- I hope he's tied up tight.
Sure he is. Denham's taking no chances.
Here are the press. Come in, boys.
- This is Ms. Darrow and Mr. Driscoll. - How do you do?
Mr. Driscoll saved you from the ape?
Yes. He was alone too. All the sailors with him had been killed.
- How did you ever tackle that baby?
- Well, Mr. Denham got him.
The rest of us were running scared.
He had the nerve to stand there and chuck bombs.
Oh, so you're the hero. Come on, give us a story.
Here now, wait a minute. Lay off me, boys.
Miss Darrow is the story. If it hadn't been for her  we couldn't have gotten near Kong.
He followed her.
- Beauty and the beast, huh?
- That's it.
Play up that angle, beauty and the beast.
Kong could have stayed safe  but he couldn't stay away from beauty.
- That's your story, boys.
- That's a lead story, all right.
- How about some pictures?
- Just a minute.
Come on the stage. Take pictures in front of the audience.
I'll make a speech and tell them about Kong, Darrow  Driscoll.
When I call you, come take pictures.
- Okay.
- That's fine.
Stand by, Ann, when I call you.
Now, now, it's all right.
We've knocked some of the fight out of him since you saw him.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am here tonight to tell you a very strange story.
A story so strange that no one will believe it.
But, ladies and gentlemen, seeing is believing  and we, my partners and I  have brought back the living proof of our adventure.
... an adventure in which 12 of our party met horrible deaths.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, before I tell you any more  I am going to show you the greatest thing your eyes ever beheld.
He was a king and a god in the world he knew  but now he comes to civilization merely a captive  a show to gratify your curiosity.
Ladies and gentlemen, look at Kong.
The Eighth Wonder of the World.
And now I want to introduce Miss Ann Darrow  the bravest girl I have ever known.
There the beast and here the beauty.
She has lived through an experience no other woman ever dreamed of.
And she was saved from the very grasp of Kong by her future husband.
I want you to meet a very brave gentleman, Mr. John Driscoll.
And now before I tell you the full story of our voyage  I will ask the gentlemen of the press to come forward  so that the audience may see them take the first photographs  of Kong and his captors.
All right, boys.
Miss Darrow first, alone. Stand in front of Kong, Ann.
- All set? Make it a good one.
- Okay.
Shoot.
Don't be alarmed. Those chains are made of chrome steel.
- It's all right, Ann.
- Get them together, boys.
- They're going to be married tomorrow.
- Put your arm around her, Driscoll.
Wait a minute. Hold on.
- He thinks you're attacking the girl.
- All the roaring, swell picture.
Come on, it's loose!
Send the riot squad and ambulances. Kong has escaped.
You're safe now, dear.
It's like a horrible dream.
It's like being back on the island again.
Now, it's all right. Don't worry.
I'm gonna stay right here with you.
Anyhow, you know they're bound to get him.
Jack, he's climbing up outside there.
- He's got Ann. He's taken her up. - The roof, quick.
Ann, Ann!
How can we follow him? What'll we do?
Fire department searchlights on the roof.
Yeah, they'll keep him in sight.
Attention all stations. Kong is going west.
He is making for the Empire State Building.
Stand by for further reports.
- If he goes up there, what can we do?
- We won't get near him.
Kong is climbing the Empire State Building.
He is still carrying Ann Darrow. That is all.
That licks us.
- One thing we haven't thought of.
- What?
Airplanes.
If he should put Ann down  and they fly close to pick him without her...
You're right. Planes.
Call the field.
- Here come the planes.
- They'll get him.
- Can they shoot him and not hit Ann?
- They'll be shooting.
Ann. Ann, hang on, dear.
- Ann, are you all right?
- Jack!
Just a moment. Wait a minute.
Let me through. My name is Denham.
Just a moment. Oh, lieutenant.
- Lieutenant, I'm Carl Denham.
- Carl Denham.
Denham?
Oh, that's the man that captured the monster.
Well, Denham, the airplanes got him.
Oh, no, it wasn't the airplanes.
It was beauty killed the beast.

T akako lrie as Taki no Shiraito
Early summer of 1890.
Among the troupes with tents up alongside Asano River in Kanazawa, there was a water artist named Taki no Shiraito.
Rumor had it that no one in the area compares to her beauty or skills.
And she knew it too.
She had quite a following.
Come one, come all!
Check it out!
The one and only T aki no Shraito Come on in foks!
Don't mss it! Come one, come all!
The highlight of the show The main attraction now!
Shiraito, as an established artist, was a woman ofpride and impulse.
And was loved by her troupe members too,
But for the past few days, she 'd been smiling softly to herself.
It's a sin to s m rk ike that!
Come on, Share the fun,
What are you talking about?
But as certain as the sun rises, there was something.
Three days earlier,..
Aboard a carriage headed from Takaoka to Isurugi,
This flower of modern civilization is said to be faster than a rickshaw,
But a rickshaw passed it before their eyes,
The passengers weren 't happy!
That ricks haw's passed us!
H ey boy!
You cal this the "power of scence'? What a joke! Shame on you!
If you're a man, prove it! Go faster,
Use the whip! ,
Come on, you foo!
Why don't you ask the horse?
I'm not the one puling this.
Quite a character, this young driver.
Young sir, just a itte faster,
Why not please the customers a itte.
But Shiraito didn't even get a response from him.
Shiraito thought that he was waiting for a tip. So she offers.,
How about 50 sen,
Let her out a itte,
Keep it!
Horses don't move for cash, so there's no use! .
Little upstart!
Who do you think you are,
Outrun by a rickshaw!
The power of modern civilization? .
You want me to pass that,
Out of spite and to take his revenge, he starts running the horse for all it was worth!
Hey, hey there! . Boy!
No tripping or slipping, right,
I don't know.
Guess it's straight on till the horse fals,
Slow it down a little, you fool!
Quite a stubborn lad, this driver,
The horse at full speed now. Passed the rickshaw in no time at all.
But one of the carriage 's axles gave out.
Shiraito figured he deserved it,
Now our young driver doesn 't look quite so proud,
W el,
W e'l make it to I s urugi by evenng,
Popped an axe,
Overdid it a bit.
What'll I do about this.
No good? .
That's too bad,
Guess this'l take more than a tip,
"Flower of science".
I'd heard it was fast, but never imagined this,
By evening, rght,
Get down from there, sister.
What? ,
Come now, miss!
What are you doing? ,
Getting you to lsurugi by nightfal.
Now!
After dragging her down, he pulled her up behind him on the horse.
There he goes,..! What about us? ,
When they arrived at Isurugi, Shiraito was unconscious,
When Shiraito regained consciousness, he set off back to Takaoka.
He wasn 't like any other men she knew.
He left a great impression on her, who till now lived for her art,
What's his name? ,
Everyone calls him Kin-san.
I see.
Kin-san,
He left behind a book.
A difficult law book. Not typical reading for a carriage driver.
This was the reason for Shiraito 's little smile.
Three days had passed.
She wants to see him again.
Shiraito, your cue! , You a right? ,
Y es, yes.
I 'm coming.
Ladies and Gentlemen!
I bring you the pride of our show! ,
The one and only Taki no Shirato!
We've been waiting for you!
A Goddess!
Tak no Shiraito!
A vixen playing battledore and shuttlecock!
Breathtaking!
A cascading goddess! .
Like the Goddess of Crystal Palace,
She mesmerized the audience.
The curtain falls in the midst of this excitement.
The annual Asano River summer show.
Monkey acts, a girl acrobatic troupe, stunt performers, knife throwers, living dolls, view boxes and electric magic.
Even among such a variety of spectacles, Shiraito was quite a crowd pleaser.
Still the day passes and night spreads her veil.
Almost like in a dream, the cheering crowds leave.
The night then brings the performers their first free time of the day.
The glimmering moon in the sky shines on the white peony that is Shiraito.
What a lovely night!
T oo good for seeping,
The only sound carried in the breeze was the water's meandering.
I 'm al worn out, So tired!
Dressed lke a young girl when I'm already 24!
But still, what a night!
Shiraito let the breeze carry her away,
Her gaze moved up along Utatsubashi Bridge.
A young man sleeping peacefully under the moon.
Who's that? .
Shinzo the barker? ,
What do you know? , It's cool up here wth some breeze,
Shnzo, you'll catch a cold,
Go ahead, catch a cod,
See if I care,
She was convinced it was Shinzo.
But when the moon lit up the man's face
She saw,..!
The pale face of the carriage driver she could not forget.
Oh my,. It's Kin-san!
Shiraito wondered if she was dreaming,
How many times had she thought of him?
Had the keeper of destiny heard her prayers?
Here they were, alone on this bridge at night.
Her cheeks blushing, Shiraito stared at his sleeping face there in the moonlight,
Ki n-san,
You sleep like a baby,
Sweet Kin-san! ,
Kin-san!
Ouch! That hurts!
You'll catch a cold sleeping out here.
Oh, did you put this cover over me? .
I've been thinking about you, How've you been? ,
Huh? . Who are you?
I've never seen you before,
It's me, You remember? .
How very kind of you,
I remember.
Kin-san,
Don't try and tel me that you don't remember me! ,
Wait! Wait a second.
I,and you,
I don't...
On the way to lsurugi, raced a rckshaw on a carriage,
Remember? .
You pulled me down and threw me on a horse,
Don't you remember that woman? ,
That was you? .
You mean I really had to tel you? ,
Stop being coy,
I'm not trying to be, but with 20 or 30 customers a day, am I supposed to remember al of their faces?
Oh.
But do you drag women away on horseback every day?
.
Of course not, I couldn't do that every day!
Kn-san! Hey Kin-san!
He surely isn't happy.
What brings you here to Kanazawa? ,
What brings you here to Kanazawa? ,
I lost that job because of you,
Because of me? ,
You must be joking!
Sure, because of me!
So you're angry at me? .
Hey,
lend me your pipe, wil you? ,
Okay? ,
Pushy, aren't you!
What's wrong wth this pipe? .
You can't even taste the tobacco.
Look at that, you lazy bum,
You're snge, right? ,
But with such good looks, you must have many women,
Rdiculous!
You mean,. Then.., There's no one?
Of course not!
Oh! Realy? .
Can't you quiet down? ,
A bug!
Help me!
Take it out!
Where? ,
Down my back.
Just a eaf,
Kin-san, Kin-san!
So, what dd you say about losing your job for me? ,
Tel me more about it,
That time, it was fine that I overtook the rickshaw.
But after the broken axle, the company let me go the next day.
I see. Then I guess,.
it realy was my fault, I see.
So now, what will you do?
What wil I do? . I have to eat,
I've got to fnd some work somewhere,
There are a lot of high officials in Kanazawa. I figured that I could find work on a carriage,
I see, Dd you find anything?
Right, you kidding? .
That's why I'm sleeping out here,
Maybe I'm out of line to say this, but you're no carriage boy,
No, I wasn't born a carriage driver,
My ancestors were samurai,
Father died three years ago, I had to quit school,
Then two years ago, my mother passed away,
Left all alone, I had to work, I started out in that carriage company,
And here I am. Such a disgrace,
But I'm not finished! I won't go to the grave a carriage driver.
I've got plans, Plans and hopes,
But stil, I guess it all comes down to chance,
That's rght, Chance.
She rules us all,
Chance and fate, That's all there is,
Kin-san,
You can't just gve up, What knd of plans? ,
Is t going back to school? .
Yeah, I'd lke to get a law degree,
Wel, if t's schooing you want, you ought to go to Tokyo,
Tokyo? .
I'd be there f I could,
But that's where chance comes in,
It's not that easy,
Come on!
You go,
You've got to go to Tokyo!
Listen,
don't get angry with me,
What f l,
I helped you out? . I mean, with money?
If only just your tuition.
But why? . There's nothng n it for you,
That's,.
For me? ,
That kind of talk is for strangers,
If you open your heart to mine, then wouldn't
that be "in t' for me? .
Please!
Let me help you!
Bowed to the keeper of destiny, Shiraito said a secret prayer.
Then she led him back to her tent.
Don't be so quiet, Loosen up.
Let me help you wth your schooling,
Please? , I'l show you.
One day you'l be a great, famous man and make me proud,
Until then, I'l help you no matter what it takes,
Kin-san,
You've got to study hard and become a great man!
Miss,
Such a noble offer,
I'm indebted to you, I wil do my best,
My name is Kinya Murakoshi,
Don't get all serious now. Lighten up a itte,
My name is Tomo Mizushima, 24 years old,
You? ,
Oh I'm.., 25 years old.
I see. Then you're a year oder than me,
Here, take this money, 30 yen.
The sooner you leave for Tokyo the better, aright? .
Kinya Murakoshi never forgets a promise!
Some day, no matter what happens to me,
I wil never forget you,
Whatever it takes, I will repay you! I promise!
Repay me? ,
Al I want is for your dreams to come true.
No, that's not fair, Can't accept that!
That's my obligation to you for beieving in me,
What do you want for yourself? ,
Please, tel me! ,
You sure? ,
Then,.. let me tell you,
Wel l,
Look at me blushing like a shy innocent girl,
An od maid ike me!
What I want is, My wish is,..
I,.I want, I want you to want me!
Blushing red, Shiraito finally got out those words.
Shiraito promises to see him through his schooling.
Shiraito and Kinya grabbed chance by the horns and joined their fate in love.
The sun starts showing its face,
Near Utatsubashi Bridge,
The sun shines on the little tent pitched on the bank of Asano River.
There in the morning mist Kinya spots a signboard,
He discovers that Tomo Mizushima of the night before was the famous water artist Taki no Shiraito.
No! No, look away!
I g nore what the sign says, T aki no Shiraito? ,
Here with you, I'm just an ordinary girl.
I am Tomo Mizushima,
The two held each other tightly as they headed for Kanazawa Station,
Their souls were as one as they made promises of a great future.
Kinya eager to acquire his law degree, he left for Tokyo.
As if in a dream, two years passed since.
Kinya opened his heart to Shiraito and left for Tokyo,
How fast the time went by,
Shiraito continued to send Kinya money,
Kinya studied hard to finish school to begin his career and make her proud.
He was a serious student and planned each step he took in meticulous detail.
Fortunately he could rent one of the rooms for the servants at a high official's residence.
There also was a generous old woman who took him on as her own flesh and blood.
The master arriving home from his office,
W elcome home.
Himself an ex-carriage driver, and the master driven to his office every morning,
Kinya told himself that one day it would be him in that carriage,
M r, M urakos hi.
Look at hi m,
One day, you too wil be a wise and important person,
Here's another etter with money from your sister,
Thank you,
It was the usual letter from Shiraito with some money.
"l am encosng a little money with this letter,
Please accept it with my prayers for your success,
My thoughts are only of you as I continue on the tour."
Even with her great appeal, the life of a traveling entertainer is never easy.
There are good times. There are bad times.
But her love for Kinya had made her strong, giving her the strength to withstand any hardship.
An esteemed water artist,
Shiraito known for her beauty and impulsiveness,
Ionged for Kinya far away in Tokyo,
One day I'll become his wife, "'
Such thought sustained her as she continued on.
Still, the approaching autumn leads the way for the coming winter,
As white patches can be seen up on the mountain peaks, the gem of the summer, Shiraito 's water act, loses its sparkle,
The crowds come no more.
This is a tough time for the performers,
In such times, they had no choice but to.., turn to a man like Gozo Iwabuchi, a loan shark.
H and it over,
My wife has it.
All we've got,
This barely covers the interest, T o say nothing of the principal,
Old rag!
Do something! Now!
I'm broke!
Wait until our next show at Naoetsu,
I'l make enough there,
So pease,
Naoetsu?
I don't know, You're touring with the water trcks, The summer's over,
A long winter for you, Problems, problems,
Don't jnx me! I need al the luck I can get,
Shiraito!
Let me have a cherry too,
Hands off!
These are my favorte, So hands off.
Instead, why not ask your honey Shinzo to buy you some noodles? ,
Dea, Nadeshiko? .
Not even one? .
They all knew about Nadeshiko, the Knife Throwing Troupe's star, and Shinzo the barker.
Buy your gir some noodles!
Today the monkey trainer was calling it quits.
Chomatsu, where are you headed? ,
I'l spend the winter at Dashoji Tempe,
I see.
Wel, good luck,
Thank you so much,
You take care too,
The summer's over, so there's nothing eft, but to wait until the snow melts in the sprng,
With your popularity, you'll be fine, No probem,
Finally winter came calling with a coating of white.
Unable to put up a show, they sit around like brooding hens.
But Shiraito never forgets about her love.
She scrapes some money together and writes him for the first time in weeks.
"Winter has come and the audiences have gone.
The waiting season for performers, I hope for the spring to come,
I am very sorry,
I am enclosing this time haf the usual amount.
This is the best I can do now.
For now please accept what I can give and study hard,
In the spring, I'l make up the difference as soon as I can.
I have only the highest hopes for you,"'
Finally she signed it "Tomo Murakoshi, "'
Tomo Murakoshi"" She liked the sound of those two words.
What's this! , Ogin!
Shiraito!
Hey! Don't act like an idiot!
I thought that we were al friends here! .
What's the idea, Ogin? ,
Forgive me, Shiraito! . Forgive me,
Please forgive me, Shiraito!
I thought that even if told you why I need that money, you'd say no, so, I,..
I,. I'm sorry,
So sorry,
Of course I'd say no,
You know how long t took me to put this together? ,
Do you think I'd et you drink it away? .
Eh, Ogin!
Drink it away? . Think I'd steal money for sake?
Do I look like such a hdeous woman? .
You broke my heart!
My mother, My mother is dying!
What, what shal I do? ,
My mother in T okyo. She's dying and I want to see her!
I don't know what to do!
I have to go to her!
Help me, Shiraito! . I can't stay here!
Unable to see my dying mother, and tortured every day by Mnami, my lousy husband!
Do me a favor and kil me!
I'd rather be dead!
Kil me, please, Shirato!
Shut up! What's all this gibberish? .
Go ahead and cry! . It'll do you no good here!
Get out of my sight!
I mean now!
Go cry your wicked heart out,
This money is for Kin-san. '
Like I might really give it away! For what?" she thinks.
But the thought of Ogin not seeing her dying mother touched Shiraito.
Without realizing, without knowing,
Shiraito tossed the money at Ogin, She was just that kind of woman,
T ake it,
Shiraito, this money! Realy? .
Shiraito, I'm so sorry!
I'l never forget this!
As ong as I breathe, I'l remember my debt to you!
Thank you, Shiraito! . I'm sorry,
That money means a lot to my Kin-san, but it's for your mother's sake!
Take it and get out of my sight!
Out of here! Rght this instant!
Can I really take this? ,
Still, for all her tears, Ogin ran off with a young stagehand that same night.
We must expect the unexpected in life,
Winter drags on,
Run out on by his wife, Minami the Knife Thrower is not in a good mood.
While everyone grumbled about the season, the only laughter came from young Nadeshiko and Shinzo.
The two always sparkled with their young love,
How happy they look. '
"'Soon Kin-san will come back for me, "
Shi nzo, you two aren't alone,
Oh, I 'm rea sorry,
"'The renowned beauty I was, loved by all for my art as well,
He made me a woman, accentuating my charms and completed me, "
Memories of Utatsubashi Bridge warmed Shiraito.
Just a little longer, "
My hair flowing in the air as we rode in the carriage.
You held me tightly as the horse went,
But you are now so far away, as I continue on my tour, "'
She's a looker,
No chance with her.
Lost in thoughts of her lover n T okyo,
There's nothng doing wth her, Not a chance,
Come on, Money works wonders,
Nah,
Not with her,
But, ook over there.
The young one there. What about her? .
Nadeshiko, How about it?
Nadeshiko, eh? ,
She's pretty, No problem? ,
No problem. She's in my troupe,
It's a deal.
The weather cleared and the show was on,
Minami the Knife Thrower did his thing on stage.
The audience was small.
But Iwabuchi forgot about Minami's debts as he fixed his eyes on young Nadeshiko, who was to become his tonight,
Even after a long closing, only this small turnout,
Every year this location brought problems.
Farewell biddings and hopes for the year to come. ""
Looki ng bad, rea bad. We're out of luck here,
Look at those empty seats. This locaton's fnished.
I'm off for Kashiwazak to see if we can get a show on there.
Ths is al the money we've got left, alrght? ,
Shiraito, remember this s our life blood for now,
Take good care of t, Shiraito.
I'm counting on you.
Bring back some good news,
I'll see what I can get going there,
Take care of the troupe while I'm gone,
Stay out of trouble,
Wel, see you.
I'll be back in no time!
Take care! .
Shiraito, it's your cue,
I'm coming.
Minami the Knife Thrower finished and Shiraito was on.
Shinzo was waiting for this moment to come up to call his Nadeshiko.
Is it true?
You realy going to lwabuchi's tonight? .
Is it true, Nadeshiko? .
Iwabuchi already paid Minami, He's my boss.
He's seling me off,
What am I to do? ,
That's rdiculous!
What kind of a beast is he? .
I don't want to go, But what can I do? ,
But we need the money,
I just want to wash my hands of this filthy business,
What am I to do? ,
Same here, I don't want you to go!
For money? .
What a bastard!
If only I had some money! ,
If I did, I'd take you away from all these scum!
What am I to do? ,
I want money!
There she is, I knew it!
Gotcha this time! Caught you red-handed!
Not getting away this time!
Meeting behnd my back! , You brazen foo!
You're coming with me to see your boss.
Come!
Let him go!
Shinzo didn't do anything, Please!
You shut up!
Wait! ,
Shut up and come with me!
Sir, keep an eye on her, She's a shifty lass,
Please let me go! Don't take Shinzo!
Quiet down, We're going to have fun tonght,
No! Get away from me!
Let go!
What are you gonna do!
He's been chasing my lttle gem. Keep hands off her or I'l show him!
This fool's one of yours, ain't he? ,
They're young. What can you do?
.
That night was filled with shouts and threats.
In the end Nadeshiko didn't go to Iwabuchi's house,
But the two young lovers knew that they had to get away.
Although wrong to run out on Shiraito who had looked after them, they made up their mind to elope.
N adeshiko!
Leave now, we can make the first train,
T ake ony what you need,
Rght or wrong, we're going. Hurry!
Not so fast!
Shiraito!
Don't be fools. You'd be caught at the staton,
Come around back,
There's a boat waiting,
Shiraito, can you forgve us? ,
Do I have a choice? ,
Nadeshiko, here. Take this money,
You'll need it,
Money? ,
Shiraito, we can't take money from you!
After all that you've done for us!
The troupe will,..
You'l need money until you find work somewhere,
Just lsten to me, Take it.
This is the beginnng of an honest lfe for you two,
I can't just let you go with nothing in your pockets.
Make me happy,
Shiraito! We wil never forget you!
But promise me you'll stay together,
Be happy together forever no matter what, alright? .
As Shiraito helped the two young lovers get away, she hoped her good deed would return as her happiness with Kinya.
What have you done now?
Where's my N adeshiko? ,
What have you done wth her? . It's all your medding!
What about me? , What am I gonna do? ,
Not my business,
Have you got any proof? .
No cue what you're talking about,
Proof? , What about your Shinzo? .
The two ran off together!
My wife eopes and now Nadeshiko,
What am I gonna do without her? ,
Can't put on a show!
This is al your fault! You gotta hep me!
Without Nadeshiko, Iwabuchi won't end me anythng for my next tour.
You've got to hep me out of this one! Shiraito!
What a crybaby.
Go ahead, Take it al,
Money! That's what I need!
Take that, get out of my sight and forget it.
We're through, That's all I got,
Come on, just get over it,
Money's al I need!
Can't live without it, 1 0, 20, 30,
38 yen and 60 sen, That's it? .
It doesn't quite make up for Nadeshiko,
But it'll do. I'll take it,
What's this? ,
You talk big, don't you? .
Have you got anything ese to say? .
I've gotlots to say!
One day you're gonna pay for your medding!
You wait and see!
I'l show you your place! ,
I hope they're aright.
I feel good,
I did something good.
I wonder how far they've gotten by now? ,
Gonji's back from his negotiations at Kashiwazaki.
He can't believe that Shiraito used up the money.
Really? . All of it?
Are you crazy? ,
What got into you? . How coud you do that?
Realy none eft? , At all? ,
Come on, congratulate me,
I did a good thng, I helped someone.
Kashiwazaki is no good, There's nothng going there,
Another low point.
No good? .
Realy? , You're not kidding, Gonji? .
Another letter from Tokyo,
Shiraito, this is no tme to be sending money to Tokyo,
We don't even have any money for the troupe members!
Think about that!
Shiraito hadn't sent anything in a while,
It's almost time for his graduation, but she had no money left to see him through.
Let's go to Kanazawa!
It'll be just the same in Kanazawa as here.
But we're from Kanazawa,
Something'll come up, We have the regulars, Let's go!
This winter's no good,
Shiraito writes Kinya a letter.
"'With no prospects for a show in Sado Island, we're heading back to Kanazawa where I'm sure something wil turn up,
As soon as I get something going, I'l send you the money that I promised,
Unti then, please be patient,"
Realizing that she was having trouble sending him his allowance,
Kinya sent Shiraito a response to the effect that he would get by from then on by himself.
"l n arrears n tuition payments, I 've decided to work,
Even if I have to quit school for the time being to support myself,
I swear to you that I wll fulfil my promse to you,
Don't burden yourself with worries for me. I'll get by,'
What am I to do? ,
I've got to send him money,
Shiraito, this is no joke!
Money to send to Tokyo? . What about our salaries!
Shiraito!
""I can't send him the money he needs.
Shiraito resigned herself to the hopelessness of it.
Shiraito,
What? ,
Come here,
What? ,
T ake a look,
In the fourth...
No, seventh aisle from the front,
That man, He's a rich merchant,
Extremely loaded,
What? ,
What are you gettng at? .
No, no, You've got it wrong,
If Taki no Shirato is asking, he's saying he'l lend money wth no strngs attached.
Come on, it's worth a try, Alright, Shraito? .
It is so nice of you to come today.
I've aways watched you perform on stage,
But now sittng here with you!
What a beauty you are! A Goddess!
Have some tea,
In need of financial assistance? , You've come to the right man,
Anything for Taki no Shiraito, For you, the sky's the imt,
So gorgeous! It's lke seeng an angel!
A sight to behold! ,
Just a second, Not qute,
Coud you hod it like this? ,
We're tradtionalsts in this house,
So, how much do you need? .
30 yen? , 50 yen? , Or 1 00 yen?
Name your price.
Get away from me!
Don't play innocent,
I came here to borrow money! I've got nothing to sel,
Come off it,
You know the score, Come on,
Who do you think I am? ,
Forget it!
Shiraito!
Wait now.
Shiraito! Wait! ,
Ouch! That hurts!
Calm down! Take it easy!
Tak no Shiraito sels her art, not her body!
Taki no Shiraito sells her art, not her body!
She left on a memorable note, but found no means of getting money,
At the end of her road, she came back to Kanazawa.
She went to Iwabuchi the loan shark, interested not in her art,
But 300 yen buys a lot more than a water act.
Iwabuchi the loan shark tossed 300 yen at her as if it were nothing,
And fixed his evil eyes on her like a viper.
He was as evil as his glare, Many women have fallen prey to him.
Poor Shiraito was dragged into a real-life nightmare.
On the way back, right around Kenroku Park.
What're you,! ,
Gve me the money!
Money? , I don't have any!
You've got 300 yen in your breast pocket!
What!
Hand it over! Now!
Let go! Rotten bastards! ,
Let go!
But Shiraito had no chance against six men.
Knives glistened in the moonlight as they thrust them at Shiraito!
Gve me the money!
Get away from me! Rotten vilains!
That's mine! , Give t back!
I need it! Give t back!
Give t back!
Shut up!
Give me back that money! Pease!
Shut up!
She lay there in the night mist,
When she woke up, she knew her 300 yen was gone.
Instead there was a knife.
That money,
That money was for Kn-san!
Those bastards!
How dare them!
It was one of the knives that Minami used on stage!
Iwabuchi! Ganged up with Minami! He set me up!
Bastard lwabuchi!
Her whole body shook with anger.
With the knife in hand, she didn't have to think about where to go.
Iwabuchi! Where are you! Iwabuchi!
Iwabuchi!
You're back,
J ust as planned.
Gve me my money!
You and Mnami! You scum!
Give t back!
A knfe? , Threatening me?
I had t al panned out for you to come back here!
Get your hands off me!
Let's see what you're like a second tme around.
My Shiraito,
Let go of me!
Let me go! Get away from me!
Bastard!
Come over here!
Let go! Let go of me!
Iwabuchi had met his destiny in Shiraito's hands as the knife sunk deep into his belly.
I'e...killed him.
I killed him.
I'm a murderer.
Shiraito was dazed.
She was in a panic,
She grabbed the money stacked on the table.
Shiraito still in a state of panic, ran away from Iwabuchi's house.
She 's a murderer!
They'll execute her!
Before they get me,
I j ust want to see Kin-san one more time,
Desperate to see her lover one last time, Shiraito ran straight to Kanazawa Station.
She caught the night train and headed for Tokyo where her love is,
It wasn 't long before the police discovered the murder,
W e arrested Minami.
Hs knife was at the crme scene,
Stil, it is not an open and shut case,
Three years had passed since that night under the bridge.
With only an address to go on,
Shiraito finally makes her way to Tokyo.
She searches for Kinya Murakoshi's place.
Where does Ki nya Murakoshi live? .
Kinya Murakoshi? ,
Mr, Murakoshi lives in a room by the gate over there,
You'll find an old ady who runs things.
Excuse me, Is there anybody home? ,
Who is it? ,
Does Kinya Murakoshi live here? .
Oh? ,
Is he home?
Please come inside,
Are you a friend of Mr, Murakosh? .
Come n, It's so cod outside,
Pease, come on in now.
Is Mr. Murakoshi home? .
I'm sorry, he went somewhere with his boss,
He didn't say where they were headed,
Not here? , Unti? ,
He didn't say, I really don't know,
Mr, Murakosh, He's really not here?
Oh.., Your kimono is soiled,
Pease, don't mind that,
Fleeing from Kanazawa and finally finding his room, but Kinya's not there.
Not here? , Kin-san's,
Shiraito was speechless.
She just blankly stared at the room,
Kin-san's, not here,
Please, make yourself comfortabe here,
You must have come a long way.
When he gets back, please give him ths,
Please keep this money safe for him,
You sure? . I'l hold on to it for him.
It's realy too bad that he's not here now,
She wanted to give him money no matter what,
See her love one last time before she got caught.
But her wish was not met,
But in this room...
Shiraito could feel him here.
Is this... This is where Kin-san studies,.
So this is it? . This is Mr, Murakoshi's room?
Y es, He's such a serious man, Mr, Murakoshi,
Every night he stands at the door watching the master return and says softly to himself, "One day that'l be me,"
It seems that he's got a terrific oder sister somewhere n the countryside,
An oder sister? .
Y es, he never stops talking about her.
Whenever he taks about her, he studies even harder.
He goes on and on about how he's got to work hard to make her proud of him, to make up for her hep,
He talks on and on about her, All the time,
Realy? .
He does? .
He's already started working, Become a wise man.
His sister must be very proud of such a brother,
You're absolutely right!
She's a specia woman with a wonderfu heart!
I always tell him so, It's al thanks to her, If t weren't for her, he never would have made it,
I hope that you can stay a little while and wait,
I'l bring us some tea,
Three years had passed.
Shiraito had been afraid, sure that he had forgotten her,
But no, every day here in this room, he sat thinking of her as he studied.
But maybe it would be better if she didn 't see him.
She was no longer the same Tomo Mizushima he knew.
She had killed a man, A murderer,
Shiraito knew that it was better if they didn 't meet.
But Shiraito was overcome by a blinding wave of intense joy.
Kinya thought of her as he studied hard.
He had taken up a post.
There she saw Kinya 's certificate of appointment.
But her fleeting dream was stolen away by a detective who had followed from Kanazawa.
Shiraito had escaped as far as Tokyo, but was finally arrested.
A falling star blown away by the wind,
On the train back to Kanazawa,
I have nothing to live for, "
Better to just end it, "'
She made up her mind and threw herself to her death,
Stop the trai n!
Suicide!
A woman! ,
Suicide!
By pure chance and luck, the small nearby restaurant she fled to was run by none other than young Shinzo and Nadeshiko.
She realy hasn't come? .
T el the truth! , There's no point hiding her,
Search the place!
Shiraito wasn't their only visitor.
No one else she knows around here,
You're al she's got.
Don't try to play the hero.
Tel the poice if she shows up!
Got that? . Understood?
Be sure to report! ,
Shinzo closed up shop early today.
But of course Shiraito was hiding inside their place.
Shiraito!
Shiraito!
Pul yoursef together! , Look at you, so worn out,
I'm sorry,
I just wanted to see Kin-san,
I'm so ashamed. I've let him down, caused you trouble!
Wait a minute, Shiraito!
Don't go outside! It's dangerous!
I can't impose on you two.
You've got your lives here, I'll only be trouble to you,
Just stay a little while!
Pul yoursef together, Shiraito!
Think it out, You've got to stay here!
We're not the kind of dogs who'd forget your kindness! ,
Whatever it takes, we'll protect you! ,
They won't get you, Never!
Shraito! You must pul yoursef out of this,
Please be strong,
I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry..,
The warmth of the young couple reached Shiraito's heart.
Shiraito, look what I've got for you, Your favorite cherres,
Go on, have some, Cheer up,
Shinzo, Forgive me,
Open up! Shinzo!
Open up here!
Damn!
We'l break in!
Open up! ,
It's the poice!
If you don't, I'l see that you're tried as an accomplce!
I'l never open it!
Tear down this door!
Went out the back!
Freeze!
Not her! Just the wfe,
You ousy rat! ,
Shiraito! Quick, out the rear!
Shiraito!
Shiraito, you've caused us enough troube with your drama.
Finally Shiraito was brought back to Kanazawa,
When the news that Taki no Shiraito had been charged with the murder of Iwabuchi the loan shark got out, the whole town came alive.
They've arrested Shi raito!
Minami says he robbed her, but Shiraito says he didn't,
Doesn't make sense,
Exactly.
At any rate, it means that she's no innocent vrgin herself,
You agree? ,
What are you talking about!
I don't care what you say! It's certain that Minami did it!
I know it!
Examination by the judge,
Hey,
Mnami! Look at this knfe,
This is one of your knives,
You still say you didn't do it? , Think anyone wil beieve you? .
Come on! Confess! ,
Your Honor, I just don't understand, I didn't do it!
You've got to beieve me!
You say you stole money from Tak no Shiraito,
Nothing more? .
No, sir.
And you dropped this knife when you were running away?
In Kenroku Park?
That's the truth,
That just doesn't fit!
Then what was ths knife doing in lwabuchi's house? .
Lying will get you nowhere! ,
Come on Shiraito, be a good gir, Tel me what happened,
Mnami calms that he stole money from you,
You say he didn't, Do you expect me to believe you? .
He robbed you, didn't he? .
There must be an expanation, Go ahead, you can tell me f Minam robbed you,
It doesn't mean that I thnk you kiled lwabuchi,
There's something strange about that money,
What was that money for? ,
If you tel the truth, I may be able to get you off.
Don't you want to be free again? ,
You,do you mean an acquitta?
This coak is yours, Look at that blood,
What can you tell me about this? .
And this knife? .
You can't stll claim that you weren't robbed!
You were robbed by Minami in Kenroku Park,
Where was the money from? . What for?
There must be a reason here,
There's no doubt that you were robbed by Mnami!
Tel me what happened!
Tel me the truth!
What was it for? .
Tel me! ,
I don't care what you say.
I wasn't robbed by Minami or anyone!
It was a complicated case,
Who is the real murderer?
The town was abuzz with speculation as to who really killed Gozo Iwabuchi.
Shiraito gave up. She knew that there was no way out.
But she dreamt only of escaping for a short time.
If only she could see Kinya once before her execution,
The murder trial to find the killer of Iwabuchi was near.
The word was that the new prosecutor coming from Tokyo was a young man of great talent,
I see! Starting to make sense,
So, the result of the prelminary hearing,
They found Minam gulty. Look! See here?
It's not so simple,
There'l be a new prosecutor from Tokyo at the trial,
They say he's quite something, Must go watch!
Sharp as a knife I heard!
What are you taking about? , You young fool!
A young prosecutor? , Another young fool.
The truth's only known by God and yours truly!
Shiraito's innocent! , Case closed,
It's Minami! Who else but him!
Shiraito's no murderer!
Quiet down, old man,
I only speak of the truth!
No way that Taki no Shiraito killed that low-down lwabuchi!
Old man. Isn't it time you went home? ,
You've been here since this morning,
The price is the same for one hour or ten hours!
Come on old-timer, It's dnner time.
Shiraito's no crimna!
Winter's cold must precede the blossoms of spring,
A time of joy, a season oflife, Here and there new faces appear.
Her soul cleansed with clear water.
She is smiling happily somewhere,
An eternal dream.
The new prosecutor wants to see you right away,
Move it! Let's go,
Come now! , Taken to the prosecutor's office.
The trial date was nearing mercilessly.
Brought her, sir,
You may go,
Please sit down.
That voice! Shiraito felt a chill,
Couldn't believe her eyes.
There was Kinya standing before her,
He now an elegant prosecutor.
While she was,
How miserable she felt.
She was a sinful murderer.
What a cruel and twisted fate.
Her pride as the top beauty of the Hokuriku region was now shattered.
The joy of seeing him came to shatter her pride and confidence,
But Kinya 's success today was because of her years of support,
She brought him to the world,
That is when a new pride and joy grew in her heart,
Can you seep well? ,
I s the food aright? .
Do you lack for anything? .
I would stil be driving a carriage if not for you,
You made me everythng I am,
Thank you very much,
Look at you,
A nobleman, What more could I ask for? ,
Congratulations!
I longed to see you,
I longed to see you,
I longed to,see you,..
You must have suffered for me for so long,
I'm sure you must hate me now.
Please forgive me.
I longed to see you, just once before I died,
Had only that thought these past days,
My wish has come true, I'm here with you.
I have no more regrets,
Go on! Question me,
You're the prosecutor!
I'm a criminal!
Question me! Do your job!
Question me!
How coud I investigate you? .
I can't, How coud I? ,
All that came out was tears.
The time passed,
Time's up, Your Honor.
Take her away,
Could there be a more cruel reunion for two lovers?
The murder case of Iwabuchi the loan shark,
Was this case linked to that money?
If that had been her, "'
Ca me from far, H er clothes were soiled,
A nice lookng woman, About 25 or 26,
There were tears in her eyes as she asked about you,
The money that was left behind that time.
If that money is related to this incident then all that she had done was for my sake.
How could I prosecute her?
It is I who ought to stand before the judge, "'
An honorable man, he made up his mind. Kinya would resign and stand trial.
Both the crime and the punishment were his.
He would stand before court,
Kinya came to Shiraito 's cell.
Everything that you did was for my sake.
It's only natural that I stand tral for you!
I couldn't stand there and watch you on tral,
That's too hdeous!
I'll... I'll stand trial!
What are you talking about? .
You're a coward!
What about me? . What of me after they execute you?
I beg you! Please don't say such a thing,
Please!
I've gven up all for your success, I have nothing left but you,
I have no regrets dying now!
Be a wise, honored man, and a respected prosecutor! ,
Grant me my last request!
Fulfil your role as a wise and honored prosecutor!
I beg you!
Don't fee sorry for me, But if you do, do your duty,
For me, do it for me! Let my death be meaningfu!
Her piercing words sunk deep in his heart.
To prosecute her was to return her love.
Kinya gave up his noble plan, and resolved himself to do his duty as a prosecutor.
The trial date finally came.
A new prosecutor from Tokyo, a man of talent and insight was coming.
And with the word that the great Taki no Shiraito will appear in court, there was a scramble for seats.
First of all came in Minami the Knife Thrower.
Everyone waited, holding their breath.
Silence filled the air.
Minami the Knife Thrower,
This is one of the knives you use in your show,
Show us how you use it.
I get up on stage and take t lke this.
Just lke that,
That's my show right there,
You've stated that you lost ths knife in Kenroku Park,
But it was found lying next to the victim,
You deny kiling lwabuchi with this knife? , Do you?
I'm no murderer! I lost that knife!
I've no part in his murder!
I'm no such devil as a murderer!
Why would I kil lwabuchi? ,
I'm no monster! I'm innocent.
All I did was, steal from Taki no Shiraito,
You stole her money? .
What about lwabuchi? ,
I may have stolen some money, but I'm no murderer,
I'm a good man at heart,
Have you got anythng else to say for yourself? ,
No, Your Honor!
Your Honor.
As prosecutor, I'd like to call Taki no Shiraito, her real name Tomo Mizushima, to the stand,
Granted,
The court calls
Tomo Mizushima,
There was a stir in the room as Shiraito entered,
Tired and haggard, her beauty has not escaped her,
Rather she had the dignity of a person facing her own fate,
T omo Mizushi ma, You'll be questioned about the murder of Gozo lwabuchi,
Folow your conscence,
Tel the truth,
"Tel ony the truth.
Add nothing and omit nothing, Speak openly and honesty,"
Prosecutor Kinya Murakoshi,
Tomo Mizushima,
I, Kinya Murakosh, as the prosecutor, ask you to tel me the truth,
Speak ony of the truth,
His resolute voice echoed in the room.
Kinya was now filled with dignity.
Shiraito was filled with joy.
How wise he 's become! '"
You say that you have no recolection of a robbery,
I 'l stand for no lies,
Even if you get off on a lie, the truth will be known in heaven or hell someday,
A common man can hide behind a veil of silence, but you're not ordnary.
Think about t, Who are you? , You're Taki no Shiraito!
Would you dare sol that name with a ie? ,
Does it mean nothing to you? .
Men are mortal, we must die, But a name is forever,
With fame ike yours, you must have many patrons,
But imagine one of them watchng you here today.
What if he saw you lie and send another to his death? ,
Would he praise your deed? . Be gad you were found innocent?
Would he smile? ,
If I were that man, and if you did such a thng,
I would bid you farewel here and look away should our paths ever cross,
If I were your patron, I would not want that,
Before things got to that, I would beg you to be strong,
I would beg you to be honest and do what is right, no matter the cost.
I urge you to tell the truth,
After she had Kinya fulfill his duty as a prosecutor,
Shiraito finally told the truth,
I was robbed.
Minami robbed me in the park that nght,
See, Your Honor? ,
I'm innocent!
So you were robbed? ,
Y es, Your Honor, I was robbed,
What's the point in hiding? ,
I had an oblgaton to my love,
A student who I pedged my life to supportng,
For the first two years
I got by somehow, sending him what I coud,
But the third, I was at my wit's end. Couldn't scrape any money together,
I had to help the man I love, So I agreed to sleep wth lwabuch,
For 300 yen!
That money meant more to me than my life!
But lwabuchi and this Minami here plotted to rob me,
Minami knocked me out in Kenroku Park!
I wanted to kill mysef, But I coudn't,
What would happen to him who depends on me?
, No, I couldn't die,
Without thinking, I grabbed the knife Minami had left.
I went back to Iwabuchi's.
He grabbed me and threw me down, He was going to rape me again!
I strugged to free myself,
And then,
You stabbed hm? .
You kiled him? ,
I killed him.
There was al that money on the table,
I needed that money!
How I wanted that money!
Dd you take it? .
I took it.
After seeing Kinya fulfill his duty, Shiraito bit out her tongue in the courthouse and wrote her own ending,
Not long after, Kinya followed her out of this world,
He took a pistol to his head on the bank of Asano River.
The spring moon still glows. The snow still sparkles.
The river flows on as before and as it always will,
Crimson tears shed for love that was not to be,
On snowy nights when the gales blow hard, people in the Hokuriku region still tell the sad tale of Taki no Shiraito and Kinya Murakoshi.
The first and last reels are missing from this film. A Shochiku Film A Mother Should be Loved
At the breakfast table, father promises to take his sons to Shichirigahama on Sunday
After the father and children leave, his high school friend, Ozaki, calls to see if he will join the class reunion.
Mother receives a disturbing phone call, informing her that he has collapsed.
She calls her sons' school to bring them home.
Go home now. Something's happened to your father.
What's the matter with our father?
I'm afraid we won't be going to the beach now...
Was your father fine this morning?
No one knows...
Mr Okazaki is here to see you.
Destiny is unpredictable. The one who rowed with us at school is dead...
Uncle from Bancho acts like he's our father.
I'd like to talk to you about this...
It's not that serious, but...
You might chide me, but I have a request. I ask as your husband's friend.
It's about the older son, Sadao.
Please raise him as your own son, as you've done till now.
I never treat Sadao differently from Kosaku.
I can swear it in front of my dead husband, and his late, first wife.
Study hard and become a great man as your father was.
It'll be hard for you...
But I am looking forward to the time when they grow up.
I'm afraid our mother's at home, crying again.
Her nose gets red when she cries.
Time passes so quickly. Kosaku, will be in 4th grade at high school.
It is very sweet of him. He sent you a postcard on his school trip.
I haven't visited Kajiwara recently. I'll drop by today.
I got a letter from Kosaku.
They're growing up. You must be happy.
Truthfully, Sadao just scolded me severely.
You were discreet, so he never suspected his upbringing.
But he saw his birth certificate when registering for college.
I've never seen such a sad face in his entire life...
Your mother is worried about you. Be kind to her like you used to be.
She kept it secret because she wanted you as her own son.
Did she have any other choice?
You also deceived me along with her!
You can't hide something like this forever.
Why didn't you tell me? I was bound to find out eventually!
I feel like I've been tricked.
I wouldn't have been selfish if I'd known.
I wouldn't have been impudent without knowing more...
How can you say that to a mother who gave you everything?
Wake up and listen to me!
Has your mother ever treated you and Kosaku differently?
Her only wish is that both of you become great men.
Don't you realize the love she has for you?
I'm sorry, Uncle.
Well, as long as you understand.
You'll never row well if you're narrow minded.
I'm very sorry, mother!
I'm truly your son.
I won't keep any secrets from now on.
Let's move to the suburbs once Kosaku enters college.
Kosaku, help me!
Dad smoked cigars and often switched pipes.
A long gray hair.
He wore this hat at the flower exhibition. Exactly a year before he died.
A splendid house! You get so much sunshine...
Don't overdo it. It's a tiny house.
But, it's convenient and easy to take care of.
My husband was fond of this. Please put it in your room.
It's been almost one year since Uncle died.
One's life is so fragile...
Everyone returns to the earth in the end...
In college, uncle was the cox and Father was 5th oar.
The current Minister of Commerce was No. 4 oar.
I wish my husband could have seen Kosaku at college.
The ship leaves at 10 o'clock.
Let me ask my brother to come with us.
We're taking a round trip to Izu. Why not join us?
You're taking more leave from school?
As long as mother agrees, go.
I've got things to do.
Have a safe trip.
Anyway, we should get him out of the whorehouse.
We can't leave Hattori as he is.
Let me go!
Hattori can't be that foolish.
Come back with me.
Why don't you take off your hat inside?
Get ready to leave!
Everyone is so concerned about you.
It's hard to find a woman to love.
You call yourself one of our rowing team?
Please come back with me.
If you hate me, I don't mind if you hit me.
But, then, you must leave with me.
Who let you take him?
Why don't you leave money for him here?
You're pretending that you're a small insect...
I can bring you money anytime.
Why did you let him hit you?
Still, that boy was brave, wasn't he?
One of my friends is in trouble. I need some money...
So you're not going to Izu?
Mother says I shouldn't go.
We have much less money than we thought.
I'm sorry to have troubled you.
Kosaku gave up his outing. How can I take your money now?
He was just going for fun. But you're obligated to your friend.
Why don't you go? It's not too late.
Never mind! Just go!
Don't worry, I'll talk to mother.
Mother, I'm leaving anyway.
Don't force your selfishness on your brother.
I gave him money. Isn't that alright?
Kosaku's been looking forward to this trip for so long.
I pity him if only I get money from you.
Mother, you always favor my brother.
I feel the same way.
I'm the only one who you always scold.
If you want to go that much, I don't mind.
If we take it like this, we won't make it before sunset.
I'm dropping a line to my mother.
Don't feel bad! Mine is Ms Kazu in the bakery.
You're such an ungrateful son!
You're even worse! Writing to your own mother?
The sun is bright, I pulled out those clothes.
He should have worn it to climb the mountain.
Kosaku never wears such clothes.
Why bother keeping such old fashioned clothes?
Even these can be worn if I alter them a little.
Kosaku should wear whatever's available...
Mother... you're treating Kosaku differently again.
Why not say I should also wear them?
You're always doing that!
You told Kosaku all about your money worries, but not a word to me!
You never act like a real parent to me.
I never meant it that way...
You always treat me special, no matter what.
Please tell me what I should do to please you.
Such reluctance bothers me.
Why don't you hit me if you disagree?
Don't say that...
You're treating us unfairly. I can't help it.
Thanks for paying me last time.
You should take off your hat in my place.
You're an unruly son.
People with hangnails never listen to their parents.
I don't understand him.
Why not apologize to Mother now you're back?
What did you say to her?
Something really awful, I guess.
Why did you make Mother cry?
She's getting old, getting sentimental.
Don't you think you've done something wrong?
She's the only mother we have.
No matter what your reasons, it's foolish to make her cry.
You're a terrible fool.
Get out!
Don't worry about me.
I can't stand aside if you speak ill of my mother.
Why do you like mother so much?
I've started to hate her.
Do you really mean that?
Have I ever lied to you?
Why don't you hit me back?
Why should I hit someone like you?
I don't understand your concern over such a mother.
Take good care of her!
Who cares what happens to him?
He's gone, after talking ill about both you and I.
Mother, where are you going?
Do you really think he is like that?
You always take his side.
He's never cared about you like you care for him.
I understand very well how Sadao feels.
He tried to do something good for us.
Your brother isn't my real son.
He handled your entrance into college, because he didn't want you to know.
He tried to leave home for your sake.
He only maligns us because he wants us to give him up.
I was stupid.
No matter what happens, I'll bring him back.
Then, he can hit me as much as he wants.
Another day is gone...
If you want to leave, go!
Hey, someone here to see you.
She's waiting downstairs.
What brings you here?
I've nothing to do with you.
I know you never mean that...
I've known you since you were a child.
If you know so much, then leave me alone.
I'm happiest when I'm left alone.
Please come back with me.
Unless you come home, I'll never get a good night's sleep.
Kosaku and your friends are hoping you'll come back.
Sorry, your wish won't come true.
Do you really think that one day
I'll take care of both you and Kosaku?
I never want to live with you and Kosaku again.
Your nose will get red if you cry more.
Mother, I don't want hear anything from you.
It's useless, no matter what you say.
A great performance, wasn't it?
I was almost shouting from the other side...
Aren't you hungry?
You'd better think about it...
Everyone has parents... Never make your parents cry.
I've got a son your age.
Do you mean he's better than me?
I'd never do this if he'd treated me better.
The eldest son eventually returned home, and all the various problems with each other were solved.
There years later, they moved to the suburbs.
There, they began a new life.
[Engine Whirring]
#Nobody knows #
#The trouble I've seen ##
[Baby] Want my quack-quack.
[Woman] No, darling, not now.
Wait till Mother finishes your bath.
Won't be butjust a minute now.
[Baby] Want my quack-quack.
[Mother] There.
Upsy-daisy.
There.
Want my quack-quack.
No, darling, not now.
Later.
Please be good.
Mommy's so late and she's got so much to do.
What's Mommy got to do?
Well, she has to get you dressed, get you breakfast, take you down to the day nursery.
Don't wanna go to the day nursery.
Want to stay home with Mommy.
Ah, darling, I wish you could, but you can't.
Why?
Because Mother has to go out and sell lots of cans of maple syrup... so she can buy nice things for her baby.
Don't want to go to the day nursery.
Marjorie pulled my hair.
She did?
She was a very bad girl to do that.
I pulled her back harder.
[Laughs] I suppose if she pulled you first, it was all right.
I pulled her first.
You did?
Then you're a naughty girl.
And you won't go to heaven.
Don't want to go to heaven.
Want my quack-quack.
# I love you and you love me #
#And I don't wanna go to the day nursery #
[Laughing]
Oh, I think we're gonna have an opera singer in the family.
Don't you?
# I love you and you love me #
#And I don't wanna go to the day nursery #
[Laughs] [Phone Ringing]
Mommy, telephone!
I hear it, darling.
[Ringing Continues] You sit here and be good for just a minute.
Okay.
[Ringing]
Hello.
Good morning, Mr. Auburn.
Yes. [Sizzling] Yes...
Yes.
Excuse me a minute, please, will you?
[Sizzling Continues]
Hello?
Yes, Mr. Auburn.
I was sorry not to find you in.
Since my husband's death, I've been carrying on his business.
[Baby] Mommy.!
Yes, dear, yes.
What, Mr. Auburn?
Mommy, can I come down?
Yes.
No, no, dear.
Wait till I finish dressing you.
That was just the baby.
Yes, I have a little girl.
Thank you.
I'll have the syrup delivered to you within an hour.
Thank you so much.
Good-bye.
[Doorbell Buzzing]
Yes?
Good morning.
I come in answer to your advertisement for a girl.
What? The advertisement what say, "Wanted:
Cook, laundress, housemaid, colored, not afraid of hard work, moderate wages."
There must be some mistake.
I haven't advertised for any girl.
Ain't this Astor Avenue?
No, this is Astor Street.
Astor Avenue is way the other side of town.
Oh.
Funny I didn't notice that little "avenue" word.
That's just my luck.
What they got two streets alike for, anyhow?
I don't know.
I don't know what I better do.
There's a streetcar at the corner.
Take that, and you'll be there in about 10 minutes.
We has to walk.
Oh.
Wait here.
I'll get you carfare.
Thank you.
Something's burnin'.
Wha...
Oh, dear.
Nice quack-quack.
[Baby Crying] Oh!
[Crying Continues]
[Crying]
Jessie!
Oh, darling.
Are you hurt?
I fell down.
Oh, darling.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, darling, look at you.
I's all wet.
Oh.
[Mother] I'll say you're all wet.
We're gonna eat such a big breakfast, aren't we?
Oh, how nice of you!
I see'd you was in a "fummix," so I thought I'd lend a hand.
Horsie. Why, darling, what do you mean by saying such a thing?
Horsie.
Nice horsie.
[All Laughing]
I've been took for many things, but I ain't never been took for that before.
Thank you for all you've done.
Here's your carfare.
I wish you good luck.
Thank you kindly.
Come on, darling.
[Whispering]
[Mother] Come on.
Run along.
You sure you wouldn't need somebody for your own self?
I'm handy with housework.
And taking care of children just comes natural to me.
I couldn't afford it.
I wish I could.
Don't worry about wages, if that's what's on your mind.
If I could get a home for my little girl,
I'd be glad to work for just room and board.
You've got a child?
Yes'm. That's the drawback about a job.
Folks just don't want Peola.
Hmph.
You sweet little child.
Come here, Peola.
Come on.
Say good mornin' to the lady, Peola.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, dear.
Why, she's a lovely little girl.
Yes'm.
She's very light.
Her pappy was a very light colored man.
Peola's a nice brung up child.
She ain't been dragged up like most of'em is.
Oh, your sweet child.
What might her name be?
It's Jessie.
As I was saying, ma'am, if you could put up with my little girl... and give her and me a roof over our heads,
I'd be willing to work for almost nothin'.
Well, I have got a room you could use, but...
Don't worry about food.
Peola, she don't eat nothin'.
She's so little.
And I's deceivin' as to proportion.
I don't eat like I look.
It's the truth.
I's very light at the table.
Honest.
Just 200 pounds of mother fighting to keep her baby.
Two hundred and forty, yes'm.
I could get jobs all right, 'ceptin' for Peola.
But I can't be separated from Peola, no matter what happens.
You know how it is, ma'am.
Indeed I do know.
Does we get to stay, ma'am?
Please.
All right, we'll try it.
[Woman] All right.
Sit down and I'll have your breakfast ready in a jiffy.
Good evenin', Miss Bea.
You're pretty late tonight.
Yes, I know.
Where's my baby?
She's gone to bed.
Oh, I thought I'd get home in time to see her before she went to sleep.
She played so hard all day, she almost went to sleep while eating supper.
I'll run up anyway.
Maybe she's still awake.
Seems like I never get to see her at all anymore.
Your supper's ready, Miss Bea.
[Groans] Oh, my feet hurt.
Come and sit down and let me rub your feet.
Come on.
All right.
Oh.
[Sighs]
That rests me all over.
It don't seem right for you to be carrying around them heavy cans of syrup, peddling'.
I've gotta make a living.
With your pretty face and them pretty foots.
You oughta have a man takin' care of you, honey.
Oh, Delilah.
Yes'm.
I had a man once, but he up and died on me.
Is that gentleman in the picture your late husband, ma'am?
Mm-hmm, that was he.
Was you very much in love with your late husband, might I inquire?
Well, I married him.
Hmph.
But did you love him?
That's what I asked, honey.
Oh, Delilah,
I think I was too young to know very much about love.
Mother was dead.
He was my father's choice.
Father wanted somebody to take care of me, so I married him.
Mmm, that's a pity.
It's too bad when you get started off on the wrong foot first.
Oh, but you'll get over it.
Youse got a big surprise comin' to you, Miss Bea.
You need some lovin', honey child.
[Chuckles] What I need is a little supper.
Yes'm.
I got some nice food ready for you tonight.
That's fine.
Thank you.
I've gotJessie.
That's enough.
Delilah, honestly now, doesn't she look like an angel?
Why she am an angel, Miss Bea.
## [Humming]
[Jessie] Can we have some pancakes too?
Please, Mammy.
They look awful tasty.
Go on out of here.
You two have had your breakfast.
Go play, and take that fleabag with you.
Okay, Aunt Delilah.
You'll be the death of me with these pancakes.
I'm glad you finds 'em to your taste, ma'am.
I've never tasted anything so good in my life.
How do you make them?
It's a secret.
Them pancakes is my grannie's secret.
She passed it down to my mammy, and my mammy told me.
But I ain't telling' nobody.
No, sir. I don't blame you.
I wouldn't either.
Down South, my mammy was famous for her pancakes.
White folks come from miles around just to taste 'em. Yes'm.
It's a secret, and it's gonna die with Delilah.
All you do is just take a little...
[Whispering]
That's all?
That's all.
There's your secret.
Course you've got to be light with the flap.
Mmm, look at the time.
You've made me late with your pancakes.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, honey.
And good luck for the day.
Thank you, Delilah.
Miss Bea?
Wait a minute.
What is it?
What's the matter?
I want you to take this rabbit's foot and put it in your money purse.
Now, Delilah!
Yes'm, you must take it.
Are you the owner?
Yes'm.
I'm Mrs. Pullman.
Mrs. B. Pullman.
You know.
Sorry, but I don't.
My husband was B. Pullman, the man who was killed in the wreck.
The train wreck at Camden.
I remember the wreck, but there were so many killed.
He used to sell waffle syrup to the hotels and places.
It's wonderful syrup.
A hundred percent pure maple.
I don't eat it.
Bad stomach.
Gas. No, I don't mean...
I'm keeping up the B. Pullman business.
I was wondering.
Could I make a deal with you to rent this store?
I have a marvelous formula for making pancakes, and it's my intention... to rent a store, have a pancake place and sell syrup on the side.
This morning I was going to decide on several sites.
This is one of them.
It's a good concession.
One of the best on the boardwalk.
How much are you asking for rent?
Two hundred and fifty.
That's very high.
[Laughs] That's terribly high.
You've got to pay for a good location.
This store has nice living quarters in the back.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
What will you do in the way of decorating?
A lot will have to be done.
It's going to rent as is.
You don't think I'd take it in this condition?
Look at it.
It's filthy!
It needs new paint, new paper.
And the floor.
That'll have to be fixed.
If it needs it, you'll have to do it.
Will you give me three months free?
What?
Give me three months free, and I'll do all the decorating and alterations.
What do you think I am?
I might consider one month.
Make it two, and I'll take a year's lease.
It's a deal. I'll have to have the first and last month in advance.
I can't do that.
I can't give you anything in advance.
When do you expect to pay?
Well, you said you'd give me two months.
So I'll start paying the third month.
Nothing doing.
But I'll need every dollar I have for alterations and fixtures.
Delilah.
Delilah!
We're going into business.
We're which?
You're going to make your pancakes, and I'm going to sell them on the boardwalk.
I've rented a concession.
We're gonna live in rooms in the back.
The store's at the front.
Get buckets, rags and soap.
We've got to start cleaning up.
Gather the children.
They'll have to go with us.
I talked to a painter and a man about the fixtures.
They'll be there, so hurry up.
There.
This is it, Delilah.
My, it's a very nice store.
You and Peola go outside and play.
There's a lovely place for you in the back.
Go look at the nice yard you've got to play in.
Won't that be pretty when there's flowers in there?
Be careful.
Don't sit on the floor, 'cause it's all dirty yet.
These will be the living quarters.
The most important thing now is the store.
Take that sign down and cover the front window with Bon Ami.
Miss Bea?
Yes.
Is somebody died?
What?
Is you been left money?
Mercy, no!
Well you only had $19 and some change this morning.
Yes, I know. Shh.
Here's the painter.
How do you do?
Hello.
You certainly did come over right away.
Yes, ma'am. All this has to be painted, the ceiling calcimined, and that back room papered in the paper I selected. This is it.
I want you to give me an estimate, and please make it low.
But I must-a see it first.
Oh, sure.
Go right ahead.
Do you paint signs?
No, but I can have one made for you.
I'll tell you what I want.
I want a great big sign with lots...
[Bea] Delilah?
Ma'am?
- Smile.
- Huh?
You know, smile.
No, no.
A great big one.
Oh, yes'm.
[Laughing]
That's it!
Now turn to the right.
Hold it.
That's what I want.
A big picture of Delilah looking like that.
And underneath, "Aunt Delilah's Homemade Pancakes."
You see what I mean?
Yes, ma'am.
But I must send someone to make that up for you.
All right. Thanks.
That's all right.
[Laughing]
Delilah!
All right.
All right.
It's all over.
It's all over.
I'm gonna make you famous yet.
## [Humming]
## [Humming Continues]
[Muttering In Italian]
My Lordy, who's that?
The furniture man about the fixtures.
How do you do?
Did you bring the estimate on the things I selected?
Yes, Mrs. Pullman.
Good.
This is where the grill should be, I think.
And all across here I'd like to have shelves.
If the shelves start there and go straight up the top, it should be nice, don't you th...
Will you excuse me?
Surely.
I'll look around.
Yes.
Thank you.
Did you get it all figured out?
I tell you.
For a first-a class-a job, there is lots of work here.
For a first-a class-a A-one job, because I don't work cheap, Yes.
The best-a figure I can give you is $193.
A hundred and ninety-three dollars?
That should be a good job.
Sure!
Five percent off for 30 days?
Huh? No, no, no.
If I give you 30 days to pay,
I can't take-a nothing off.
All right, $193 in 30 days.
Uh-huh.
That's fine.
And you'll do a good job?
Sure. And start right away.
Sure.
I take another man off another job.
And we start-a right away.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
You're gonna have a nice place here.
I hope so. You'd better make it eight tables instead of six.
Yes, ma'am.
That'll mean 32 chairs.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
The coffee urn, the grill, the counter stools and the dishes.
Here's the list.
Installed, that will cost you $1,560.
How much for cash?
That is cash.
Oh, that...
# I puts my trust in Jesus #
## [Humming]
And the terms for monthly payments?
Ten percent down on delivery and $50 a month.
You're asking $156 down?
I might as well pay cash!
Make it $50 straight monthly payments.
Only $50 down?
Why, that'll hardly pay the cost of my trucking.
That's the best I can do.
I'm opening a chain of these shops along the boardwalk.
I already have a large wholesale distribution of maple syrup.
That takes up a great deal of my ready cash.
Make it $50 straight monthly payments, and it's a deal.
I don't know now.
You see...
How soon could you have the fixtures installed?
With the exception of the grill, right away.
Of course, that will take time.
I can't do much without the grill, so you will hurry it up, won't you?
I'll do the best I can, but...
I'll be down later this afternoon and sign the order.
But you see...
[Gasps] What a lovely scarf pin.
Yes, it is.
[Chuckles]
I wish you could make it a little more down.
[Laughs] Don't be so greedy.
Just look what a big order I've given you.
Yes, I am. Be sure and come in for some pancakes sometime.
Pancakes?
Oh, pancakes.
[Laughing] Yes.
Yes, pancakes.
Good-bye.
Thank you.
Come again.
There you are, Mrs. Pullman.
Paid in full.
Think of that.
I've really paid my last debt.
It's more than a great many can say.
Yes, ma'am.
You've built up a mighty pretty business here, Mrs. Pullman.
Mighty pretty.
It does you good to see someone go ahead and make a success.
[Laughs] It hasn't been so easy as all that.
You'll never know how near you've come to getting your fixtures back on your hands.
But all in all, I've got by and I've nothing to complain of.
You've no idea how often I've told the story, the way you opened up here.
You paid nothing down on the store because you agreed to put the improvements in.
And you got the improvements because you had the store.
[Laughing]
About the only cash you put out was on my fixtures.
And when I came to collect, you talked me out of that.
[Laughing]
All I had was talk.
And yet, a pretty woman like you...
Ah, we won't go into that.
Come on, children.
Time for school.
In a minute, Mommy.
[Man] Good day, Mrs. Pullman.
Let's go.
Let's do it over again.
All right.
England?
France?
London.
Paris.
Italy?
Don't tell me now.
Rome.
Now you ask me.
Germany?
Berlin.
Denmark?
Don't tell me, now.
Copenhagen.
Belgium?
Sprouts?
You mean Brussels!
Yeah.
[Peola] First thing you know, you're gonna get a "D"again.
[Jessie] Good-bye, Mommy.
Good-bye, honey.
They sure likes each other, them two.
Peola's smarter than Jessie.
Yes'm.
We all starts out that way.
We don't get dumb till later on.
Oh, Delilah.
It's been nice for them to have each other all these years when we've been so busy.
You think we all gonna make money, Miss Bea?
I hope so, Delilah.
It's hard to start out.
But we've paid our debts, we've got money in the bank.
We're certainly better off than we were five years ago.
We sure is, honey.
It certainly would be nice if we got rich.
It certainly would.
I could send Jessie away to college.
And Peola, she wouldn't have to do housework for nobody.
Once in a while, we could take a vacation.
All the vacation I need is to get off of my feet.
Maybe have a little place in the country.
There's plenty gentlemen on the boardwalk would be glad to give you that and more... if you weren't so set in your ways.
I sees them smiling' at you.
[Chuckling]
There's Peola.
I wonder what's the matter.
[Crying]
[Crying Continues]
[Crying] Peola?
Peola! What's the matter, honey?
What's happened?
[Delilah] Peola.
What's happened to my baby?
I'm not black!
I'm not black!
I won't be black!
[Bea] Peola.!
She called me black.
Jessie called me that.
[Delilah] Now, now.
Jessie.
Jessie Pullman, for shame on you.
[Delilah] Come and sit on Mammy's lap.
That's a girl.
[Crying] Shh.
Now, now, now, Peola.
Calm yourself, baby.
You gotta learn to take it.
You might just as well begin now.
You apologize to Peola this minute.
No, no, Miss Bea.
Don't make her apologize.
Ain't no good in that.
[Crying]
You!
It's 'cause you're black.
You make me black.
[Peola] I won't.!
I won't.!
I won't be black.
Jessie, how could you say such a mean, cruel thing to Peola?
I didn't mean anything.
It 'tain't her fault, Miss Bea.
It ain't yours and it ain't mine.
I don't know rightly where the blame lies.
It can't be our Lord's.
It's got me puzzled.
[Rain Falling] [Bea] Oh, dear.!
I don't want to get the Old Maid again.
Your turn now.
Let's see.
Watch me pick a real good one.
Ah, shucks!
[Laughs] That was a good one.
Now, be careful.
How you feeling, darling?
My headache's much better.
Is it?
Uh-huh.
School's nearly out.
It's time to be better.
I really have got a cold.
I know you have, darling.
I was only fooling.
Anyway, I'm glad to have an excuse to keep you home with me.
My, ain't that rain raining' terrible?
Surely is.
Seem like the ocean's turned bottom side upwards.
How you feel, honey?
Better, thank you.
Oh, that's good.
My Peola forgot her rubbers and umbrella.
I guess I better meet her with 'em else we'll have two of'em down instead of one.
[Teacher] We'll read a chapter until the rain lets up.
Then I think you'll be able to get home.
Shall it be Little Men or Little Women?
Little Women.!
All right.
Little Women.
[Teacher] "Jo was very busy in the garret,
"for the October days began to grow chilly and the afternoons were short.
For two or three hours, the sun lay warmly in the high window."
[Knocking]
Good afternoon, ma'am.
It's rainin' so hard,
I brought rubbers and coat to fetch my little girl home.
You've made some mistake.
Ain't this the 3-B?
Yes.
Well, this is it.
It can't be it.
I have no colored children in my class.
Oh, thank you.
There's my little girl.
Peola. Oh.
My poor baby.
Teacher, has she been passin'?
Passin'?
Why, yes.
Peola.
[Teacher] You may go home.
[Boy] Gee, I didn't know she was colored.
[Girl] Neither did I.
[Children Mumbling]
I hate you.
I hate you!
I hate you!
Peola!
Peola, honey!
Peola.! Peola, honey.!
Some rain!
Yeah.
Hello.
Swell weather for ducks.
Not for business.
No.
Hotcakes and coffee.
I see you have a window-shopper, Mrs. Pullman.
Yeah.
Some aroma.
Why don't you come in and have some?
If I had the price, I'd been outside of six stacks of'em already.
Oh.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm practically the greatest living pancake surrounder... in the Western Hemisphere.
I took it up as a child.
Took years to perfect myself.
But I'm not having any today.
I'm sorry.
Not half as sorry as I am.
Come and have some anyway, on the house.
You mean it?
Sure, I do.
I'm practically in.
Why, Peola, didn't you see your mother?
Yes, I saw her.
She had your raincoat and rubbers.
What happened?
Nothing.
Come, Peola.
Let me take those wet clothes off of ya.
Go away.
Leave me alone.
Now, baby, there ain't no need of being thataway.
Go away and leave me alone!
What's the matter?
Don't tell her.
Don't tell me what?
She was passin', Miss Bea, and I give her away.
She know I wouldn't have done it on purpose.
Now, Peola, you mustn't feel that way.
Oh, she can't help herself just now, Miss Bea.
She's like her pappy was.
He beat his fists against life all his days.
It eat him through and through.
Go on, darling.
Take your wet clothes off.
Perhaps you'd better send her to a different school.
I can't keep sending her to different schools all her life, Miss Bea.
[Sighs]
Well, were they good?
Good?
Listen, man and boy, I've been eating griddle cakes for 35 years, but I never tasted any as good as these.
What do you put in 'em?
That's the secret.
That's what I was afraid of.
Too bad too. Why?
To keep anything as wonderful as this away from the world.
How'd you like to trade in another stack of wheat cakes... for a hundred-thousand dollar idea?
Honest.
I mean it.
Mean what?
I can tell you in two words how to make a million dollars.
Just two?
Just two.
Did you ever hear the story of Coca-Cola?
No.
When they first put it on the market, they used to peddle it over soda fountains for five cents a copy.
But it didn't make any money.
One day a smart fella nudged the president and said,
"For $100,000, I'll tell you in two words how to make millions."
You know what those two words were?
Uh-uh.
"Bottle it."
"Bottle it"?
Mm-hmm.
Now, the pancakes...
the flour, I mean, box it.
Box it?
Sure, box it.
Do I get that stack of wheat?
The other fella got a hundred thousand smackers.
Yeah!
Yeah, you get all the pancakes you can eat, and a job besides.
Well, I don't know about that.
I ain't gonna do it, Miss Bea.
No, ma'am, I ain't gonna do it.
I don't know why I bother about all this.
I've gone without my dinner.
I barnstormed over here in the snow... to tell her she's on Easy Street.
And I get just as far as a stranded dogfish on the Barnegat Shoals.
Now you tell her.
Now, look, Delilah.
We've made $15,000 in the last six months.
We'll double that byJuly, and make $100,000 next year.
So now we want to incorporate.
Yes'm. That's the best way to run a business.
Yes'm.
Now, here are the papers for you to sign.
But if I sign them, then what?
Then you'll have a 20% interest in the Aunt Delilah Corporation.
You'll be rich.
You'll have your own car, your own house.
My own house?
You gonna send me away, Miss Bea?
I can't live with ya?
Honey child, please don't send me away.
Don't do that to me.
Why, don't you want your own house?
No.
How am I gonna take care of you and Miss Jessie if I ain't here?
Oh, Delilah.
You'll have me in tears in a minute.
Let me and Peola stay the same as we been doin'.
I's your cook, and I wanna stay your cook.
Of course you can stay, Delilah.
I only thought now that the money's coming in... and after all, it's all from your pancake flour.
I gives it to ya, honey.
I makes you a present of it.
Youse welcome.
Oh, Delilah, you're hopeless.
I could've told you that.
Well, I'll simply have to put the money in the bank for you.
That's all right, if you want to, against my funeral.
I does hanker for a good funeral.
Once a pancake, always a pancake.
[Chattering, Laughing]
What are you doing behind the bar?
I'm hiding.
Hiding?
What do you mean?
It's all your fault.
Look at me.
What's the matter?
You look grand.
Yeah, I look like a crow calling to its firstborn.
Did you hear what I was saying?
No. I've been trying to say that you're one of the grandest party givers in New York.
Have another cocktail.
Good. I will.
I want to drink a toast.
Gentlemen, I give you the fifth anniversary...
No, no, the 10th.
The 10th anniversary of Aunt Delilah's Pancake Flour.
Thank you.
You're kind.
## [Continues]
Them boys sure play good for white boys.
They oughta play well.
They get paid enough for it.
What's that got to do with it, Peola?
Oh, nothing.
A charming party, Bea.
Thank you, darling.
Hello, Hugo.
Hello, my dear.
Sorry I'm late.
It's nice to see you anytime.
You're beautiful tonight, and so young.
Thank you.
Bless you for that.
Is Jessie still at school?
I suppose she'll come home a young lady.
[Bea Laughing] I'm afraid so.
Come on, honey, I'll dance with ya.
Can't you leave me alone?
I don't want to dance.
I want to read.
How long is this party gonna keep up anyway?
What's the matter with my baby?
I'm sick and tired of it.
What, the party?
No... not the party.
What is it, baby?
What's my baby want?
I wanna be white like I look.
Peola. Look at me.
Am I not white?
Isn't that a white girl?
Honey, we's had this out so many times.
Can't you get it out of your head?
No, I can't.
You wouldn't understand that, would you?
Oh, what is there for me anyway?
[Door Closes] Peola.
Are you looking for something?
Yes.
The doorbell.
The doorbell?
Yes, isn't it silly?
I can't find the doorbell.
I've heard of people lighting matches to find house numbers, but never a doorbell.
Do you know, by any chance, where it's hidden?
Why, yes.
It's over there.
It's all right, thanks.
I can get in now.
Jarvis?
Yes, madam.
Who's the gentleman who just came in?
I don't know, madam.
I thought perhaps...
The light isn't working.
Will you have it fixed?
Very good, madam.
Oh!
Hello.
Hello!
Well, I finally got in.
Yes, so I see.
By the way, have you ever seen that doorbell?
Why, yes... I supposed it's studded with diamonds, and they put it in the safe after dark.
I'm coming up here by daylight and take a good look at it.
Yes, do.
Shall we dance?
Mm-hmm.
I'd love to.
Excuse me.
I was late getting here.
The party's nearly over.
Not for me.
And to think I had this forced on me.
You didn't want to come?
No. A friend asked me.
Elmer Smith.
Oh, Elmer asked you!
Yes.
Do you know him?
Yes.
He's been trying to drag me up to see her ever since I got in town.
See whom?
Mrs. Pullman, the pancake queen.
Oh!
I put it off as long as I could.
Mm-hmm.
You know, these big businesswomen frighten me to death.
Why?
They're so efficient and competent, and...
Tell me, what's she really like?
Oh, she's, um...
Let's see.
Why don't you ask your friend Elmer?
No, he says she's beautiful.
Wonderful.
A noble character.
But what else could he say?
You don't think he'd jeopardize a $50,000 a year job.
[Laughs] Not Elmer.
## [Ends]
May I get you something?
An ice or some "flannel" cakes?
Flannel cakes?
Yes, or whatever she calls them.
You don't think a pancake queen is going to pass an opportunity to advertise her product?
I'd like some champagne.
May I have two...
Just one moment, sir. Please.
[Elmer] There must be more than this.!
But there are still six cases left, sir.
It's going awfully fast.
Here, keep these two for me.
I may need them later.
Yes, sir.
So that's where you are!
You're late.
You're drunk.
You're a liar.
May I have two?
At once, sir. Nice time to be showing up.
I've been here for hours.
No wonder I couldn't find you hiding behind this bar.
Nice way to treat a guest.
A stranger too.
I've been watching for you all night.
Didn't think you'd wait till the party was over.
Why do they build dog kennels in bars?
Come on.
I want you to meet Mrs. Pullman.
Can't now.
Some other time.
What do you mean, "some other time"?
I've something more important to do right now.
For instance?
I'm taking a drink to a very charming lady.
You haven't lost any time, have you?
I tried not to.
Don't you think it's time you paid your respects to your hostess?
Later.
Here she is, and you're going to meet her, whether you want to or not.
Bea, this is an old friend of mine, Stephen Archer.
Steve, this is Mrs. Pullman.
The pancake queen.
Oh.
I don't know what to say.
How to...
I've been so rude.
I'm so sorry.
Sorry!
What are you sorry about now?
I hope you'll never know.
Say, what's the matter with him anyway?
Don't feel too badly.
I led you on to your downfall.
I feel all kinds of a fool.
You see, I was to have met Elmer here.
And then I...
I met you instead.
It's all right now, isn't it?
If you say so, yes.
You know, I'm not really civilized.
For the past eight months I've been walking on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean... with jellyfish and whales.
What are you talking about?
Let me introduce myself again.
My name is Stephen Archer, and I am an ichthyologist.
A what?
Ichthyologist.
Fishes.
I study fishes for those who are interested in the life of the fish.
So you can better understand why a man who spends all of his time with fish... should behave like one.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Have one?
No, thanks.
[Bea] Good night.
[Bea] Good night.
Well, it's getting late.
The guests are going home.
I said the guests were going home.
Yes, I know.
It's after 2:00.
Way after.
I'm aware of the time.
Also other things.
It's no use you hanging around here.
Tomorrow you'll just be the forgotten man, that's all.
Then I'd better make the most of tonight.
She's got no time for silly romance.
She's such a charming woman.
Uh-huh.
And you're such a fortunate man.
Why? To be her general manager.
You don't, by any chance, need an office boy down there, do you?
Yes.
We've got one.
I'm it.
[Laughing]
Good night.
Good night, dear.
I'll see you Thursday.
I'll be there.
Good night.
Leaving, Elmer?
Or can I get you something?
You can get my hat and coat.
I'm going home.
Jarvis, Mr. Smith's hat and coat.
Where did you meet that nice friend of yours?
I don't remember.
I think it was in a speakeasy.
He's a fugitive from justice.
I don't know how such people get into your house.
## [Piano]
Put the piano in the safe.
But he's a friend of yours, isn't he?
That's my story, and I'm going to stick to it.
That's all, Jarvis.
The old bear loves you, doesn't he?
He's been such a faithful watchdog toJessie and me.
Jessie?
My daughter.
Here she is.
Oh.
She's older than that now.
She's away at school.
She's charming.
Like you.
She doesn't seem so wonderful to others, but to me, she's the beginning and the end of everything.
I don't wonder.
Not finished?
Are you throwing me out?
I'm a working woman.
There's tomorrow morning, you know.
This must be yours.
It's the only one left.
This is brutal.
I'll go on two conditions.
What? That you lunch with me tomorrow.
I mean today at...
I never go out for lunch.
At Pierre's at 1:15.
[Laughs] All right.
But I said two conditions.
What's the other?
Will you kiss me?
What?
So I'll know I'm forgiven.
You did lead me on, you know.
It was fun.
Just a little bit cruel, aren't you?
I'm a woman.
You'reJuliet and Beatrice and Diana of the Crossways.
All the women I've loved.
Have you only loved characters in books?
Mostly.
Waiting for one to come alive.
And now one has.
Thank you.
Pierre's at 1:15.
Good night.
Good night.
By the way, next time... the bell is here.
I'll remember next time.
## [Whistling]
## [Whistling Continues]
[Bea] Hello, Delilah.
Come on up.
Let's talk the party over.
It's the best part of it anyway.
Everybody gone?
Mm-hmm.
I'm not a bit sleepy.
Don't bother about that now.
Let it go till morning.
Miss Bea, you sure had a good party.
I think so.
It feels good to get those off. I'll bet it does.
Come here.
Let me take 'em.
Put 'em up here.
That's it.
That's what you used to do in the old boardwalk days.
When my feet ached from peddling maple syrup.
Remember?
I remembers.
We's gone a long ways from there, ain't we, though?
We certainly have.
Miss Bea, there was a very handsome gentleman up here tonight.
I got a peek at him.
Who might he be?
I wonder which one.
Don't you know a handsome gentleman when you sees one, honey?
There was a handsome gentleman.
I wonder if I mean the same one you mean.
You does, honey.
What's the gentleman's name?
Stephen Archer.
Hmm.
That's a good name for a good man.
Funny thing, Miss Bea.
I got a great sense about a man.
You ain't takin' no chance there.
Mercy, Delilah!
Of course I'm not taking a chance!
To hear you talk, you'd think he'd proposed and been accepted.
That's all right.
Leave him be. Things is workin'.
Leave him be.
I'll leave him be.
You gotta do your part, honey.
What on earth do you mean?
If he makes a move in the right direction, you don't have to slap his hand, in a manner of speaking'.
There's nothing farther from my mind than a husband.
What he do, Miss Bea?
He's an ichthyologist.
[Chuckles] Yes'm.
I always say, there ain't a better business for a man to be in.
He make pretty good money at it, I guess.
At what, Delilah?
At that "ichylologist" business.
Yes, I think he does very well at it.
Well, I declare.
Keep him indoors, I suppose.
No, outdoors most of the time.
A traveling' man, I reckon.
All over the world.
All over the world.
Say, honey, what is this business of his?
[Laughing]
It's fishing, Delilah.
Just fishin'?
Uh-huh.
With a hook?
No.
The study of fishes.
Oh.
But I wouldn't let that stand in my way.
Let him go fishin'.
There's worse things.
Funny, though.
He don't look to be a lazy man.
Oh, Delilah.
You're incurably romantic.
It 'tain't romantic to want a man.
Just natural.
I've gotJessie.
And you've got Peola.
Yes'm.
I got Peola, Miss Bea.
What am I gonna do about that poor child?
She's so unhappy.
Delilah, I've been wondering if it might not be better if you could send Peola... to one of those good colleges in the South for colored people, where she could finish her education and she wouldn't be faced... with the problem of white all the time.
You know what a disaster her schooling has been here.
If she'd only go.
Ask her anyway.
We've worked so long and so hard for our two girls.
And forJessie, it's been well worthwhile.
I want you to have the same satisfaction with Peola.
You deserve it, Delilah.
I'll do everything in my power to help you.
Maybe down there in some other school...
Why don't you talk to her?
Yes'm.
I'll go right down, and if she ain't asleep,
I'll try and reason with her.
Yes, try, Delilah.
Yes'm.
Good night, Miss Bea.
Good night, dear.
Asleep yet, honey?
No.
Peola, won't you be a good child like you can be, darling, and do something for your mammy?
Don't say "mammy"!
Look here, baby, you go down South... to one of them high-toned colleges where only the high-toned goes.
Wouldn't you do that for me, honey?
A Negro school?
Ain't nothing to be ashamed of, daughter dear.
Meet your cross halfway.
It won't be near so heavy.
Go amongst your own.
Quit battling'!
Your little head's sore now from buttin' against stone walls.
Open up and say, "Lord, I bows my head."
He made you black, honey.
Don't be tellin' him his business.
Accept it, honey.
Do that for your mammy, your mother, dear.
[Crying]
Oh, my baby.
## [Humming A Hymn]
## [Whistling]
You back again?
Hello, Elmer.
Not staying for dinner?
No.
Do you realize what you're doing?
Don't you know you're spoiling one of the best businesswomen in New York?
Me?
And ruining a great business?
Oh, Elmer, you overrate my powers.
Ever since the night I introduced you here, what's it been?
Paradise.
Yeah. Not for the stockholders.
You're overly sensitive about them.
Stockholders don't expect anything anymore.
They've been trained not to.
In the name of the National Recovery Act, will you let her have a day free... so we can get some office work done at the office?
Is that the only reason you want me to leave her alone?
You'd make a great undertaker.
[Chuckling]
My, Miss Bea, you sure do look beautiful!
Thank you, Delilah.
Do you like my dress?
Mmm!
It ain't your dress.
It's more than that.
It's in your eyes and your cheeks.
It's come to you, Miss Bea.
What's come?
Has he gotten very far yet?
Delilah, you're a matchmaker at heart.
There's Mr. Archer now.
Miss Bea, when you sits on the sofa, sit to this end, thisaway, not to that end, thataway.
What are you talking about?
I's done put my bestest rabbit foot underneath the pillow.
[Bea Laughing]
Hello, Stephen.
What are you laughing at?
Tell me so I can laugh too.
I wouldn't dare now.
Perhaps later.
It's a century since I saw you last.
Four hours.
Look at your lovely flowers.
It's so nice of you to send them to me every day.
[Boat Whistle Blows]
Bea, down the river there, you can't see it because it's beyond the bend, my boat is waiting.
In 10 days, you can be drifting in a tropic sea... under a night sky of the most unbelievable blue.
All full of stars that burn warmly.
And so close, you can almost take them in your hands.
I know it sounds too poetic, but so help me it's true!
[Boat Whistle Blows]
You'd glide past mysterious little islands, black and silent.
And in the water under your feet, you'd see sudden shining streaks of phosphorescence like shooting stars.
Flying fish.
And on the shore breeze, there'd come to you... the perfume of warm lands:
Hyacinth, jasmine.
And there isn't a sound.
It's all silent.
All my life, I've never known silence.
There are seven telephones on my desk.
I hear them ringing even in my sleep.
Down there we don't have telephones... or conferences or stockholders' meetings.
The only businessmen are the sharks.
They're the collectors.
Only they don't collect, they just glide by.
It sounds like paradise.
It is paradise.
It could be if...
Bea, I haven't made a mistake about you, have I?
You do like me?
Like you?
Uh-uh.
I love you, Stephen.
Oh, Bea!
I've loved you from the first minute when I looked out the window... and you were having such an awful time with the doorbell.
Darling!
Let's not wait very long.
Let's be married soon.
Whenever you like.
Oh, my dear!
Before you know it, we'll be on the bridge of my boat sailing down the bay.
Destination?
Wherever we feel like going.
With you, anywhere!
Um.
Oh, I forgot.
What?
There's Jessie.
What aboutJessie?
She'll be home in a few days for her vacation.
Well?
Stephen, will you do something for me?
Of course!
Anything.
Let's keep it a secret for a while.
Let's not tellJessie anything about you and me, not at first.
Whatever you say.
I want her to know you and like you before she finds out about us.
You see, Jessie and I, we've always been together, just the two of us.
Don't you worry.
Just leaveJessie to me.
I'll be so nice to her that by the time we're ready to break the news, she'll be begging you to marry me.
I'm sure she will.
Hello, Jarvis.
How do you do, sir?
Miss Pullman is in the drawing room.
Yeah? Hello!
Hello.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I thought Mrs. Pullman was here.
I'm Jessie Pullman.
Won't you come in?
But...
But it...
What?
But you're supposed to be just a little girl.
But I'm not! I'm grown up.
Look.
Oh, that's an old picture.
Mother will keep it out.
I'm going to have some new ones made.
I am Stephen Archer.
I'm a friend of your mother's.
Do sit down.
Mother should be here any minute.
She wasn't expecting me until tomorrow.
So I understood.
How long's your vacation to be?
Oh, you know it's a vacation?
I know a lot about you, except how big you are.
There you fooled me.
I love vacations.
This one's only two weeks.
But I expect to squeeze every minute out of it.
I couldn't get home fast enough to be with Mother.
There's your mother now.
Mother.!
Darling!
Darling!
Mother!
Mmm!
When did you get here?
About 3:00.
Why didn't you let me know?
[Jessie] I wanted to surprise you.
I had a chance to motor down with Janie Prentice.
I thought you wouldn't be through with your exams until today.
I was supposed to take one in algebra this morning, but I would have flunked anyway, so I didn't see any reason for staying.
If it's algebra, I don't care.
But don't tell me you failed in anything else?
Oh, no, I was a very bright child.
Passed in everything else.
Mother, could I change from English composition to dramatics next term?
Yes, darling.
Let me look at you!
Good heavens!
How you've grown!
[Jessie] I'll say.
None of my clothes fit me anymore.
Going to have to have some new ones.
Oh, I can't bear it.
My little girl's grown up.
It's too dreadful.
Mother, may I go to your dressmaker this time?
I feel so silly in these simple things.
We'll see.
And I need a new riding habit for the horse show.
You're coming up for it, aren't you?
I don't know.
I'll try.
You...
Oh, Stephen, I'm so sorry.
This is my daughter.
We're old friends.
Mr. Archer and I have been talking.
Oh!
He's an ichthyologist.
Do you know what that is?
Why, Mother, what do you think I go to school for?
Oh, I beg your pardon!
I'm dying for my tea.
Will you tellJarvis?
Of course.
- Did you see Delilah?
- Yes, I've seen everyone.
Isn't she sweet?
Her mother all over again.
Oh.
It seems I can't do without you even for a little while.
Even for the few minutes I do go to the office.
Mmm, sweet.
Oh, Stephen, isn't she big?
[Laughing]
She's tall, but she's just a baby.
I'm going to forget about the office whileJessie's in town.
We'll give her one round of gaiety:
Dinners, theaters, restaurants.
You'll help me, won't you?
Of course I will.
Ichthyologist.
Ichthyologist.
Ichthyologist.
L-C-H...
Ichthyologist.
Ichthyologist.
"One who makes a study of... fish."
Fish?
Here's your tea, darling.
No, thanks.
I really don't care for any.
No?
Well, I'm gonna swallow mine and go freshen up a bit.
Not even one of these?
No, thank you.
Mr. Archer and I are going to give you a whirl to take the taste of school out of your mouth.
I'm going to play hooky from the office too.
That'll be grand!
Mr. Archer's idea.
He says he'll be proud to take us about.
I will, indeed.
We're going to have a marvelous time.
You and Stephen can plan what plays you'd like to see while I'm dressing.
Well, have you any suggestions about plays?
Do you know what's on?
I'm afraid I don't.
I'll have to look over the list.
But I'm very much interested in ichthyology.
Are you?
That's very flattering.
Take, for instance, the habits of the sea mew.
Is the sea mew the same family...
I'm afraid you have me stumped there.
You see, my subject is fish.
The sea mew is a bird.
Oh.
But that's a perfectly natural mistake.
The sea mew ought to be a fish.
[Laughing] I'm caught, aren't I?
The very first crack.
It takes a bit of doing to tell the birds from the fish.
I suppose I'd better confess.
Oh, do. I was bluffing.
I didn't know what ichthyology meant until I looked it up.
But I read so fast, I couldn't remember.
A better way for you to learn about ichthyology would be to see my private aquarium.
Could I?
I'd love to.
When may I come?
Would tomorrow be too soon?
Tomorrow would be perfect.
[Knocking At Door] Come in.
Hello, Delilah.
Excuse me, Miss Bea.
I hope I ain't bothering ya.
What is it?
I'm in trouble again.
Peola.
She's left the school.
Oh, Delilah!
I'm sure it's not as bad as you think.
But it's four days now since she left the school, and she ain't come home.
We'll go down there.
We won't leave a stone unturned until we find her.
Mother.!
Darling, I'm so sorry.
I've got to go away for a few days.
Delilah has had some bad news.
Peola's disappeared from the school, so I've got to go down there with her.
What do you suppose...
We don't know anything more, darling.
I'm sorry.
Anything I can do? Yes.
Will you take care ofJessie?
I'll do my best.
There's Delilah now.
Poor Delilah.
I'll go speak to her.
Yes, do.
I'm awfully sorry, Delilah.
I know everything's going to be all right.
[Delilah] If anything happens to that child,
I just get sick all over.
I hate to run away, but if you could have seen Delilah's face...
I understand.
I'll say good-bye here.
Good-bye, darling.
Telegraph me often.
Yes, I will, darling.
I wish I could go with you.
I wish you could too, but there's Jessie.
I know.
By the time you get back, Jessie and I will be great friends.
I'm sure you will.
[Train Whistle Blowing]
Good evening, madam.
Good evening, sir.
Two, please.
Certainly.
This way, please.
This must be the place.
There she is, Miss Bea!
Yes.
How do you like your new job?
Very much, thank you.
[Cash Register Bell Rings]
Thank you.
Give me one of those.
Yes.
What can I do for you?
Peola. We've been looking everywhere for you.
Are you talking to me?
There must be some mistake.
My name isn't Peola.
There ain't no mistake.
Why have you got this job?
You don't have to work.
I'll give you everything you want.
What are you talking about?
I'm sure you've got me confused with someone else.
Why, Peola child!
I'm your mammy!
Why, that's ridiculous!
I never saw you before in my life!
[Man] What's the meaning of this?
This woman doesn't know what she's talking about.
Do I look like her daughter?
Do I look like I could be her daughter?
Why, she must be crazy!
[Bea] Peola.!
How can you talk to your mother that way?
Come on, Delilah.
Come on.
Brace up, Delilah.
Everything will turn out all right.
We'll find her again.
Yes'm.
Miss Bea, there she is!
She's back.
Peola's come home.
She's back home.
My baby!
[Door Opens, Closes]
[Footsteps]
Baby!
My little lamb.
Oh.
Peola, you're back.!
Yes, Mother.
And I want to tell you how sorry I am for what I did to you.
Oh, that's all right.
Come, come, baby, and sit down.
It don't feel like you're really here standing' so far off.
Mother, I've done everything you wanted me to.
I went to that school and tried to be happy there to please you.
But I couldn't bear it.
I couldn't.!
I had to get away.!
I understand, baby.
We're gonna forget all about it now.
It's all right.
But it isn't all right.
[Peola] I want to talk to you.
I'll go upstairs, Delilah.
[Delilah] No, Miss Bea.
You stay, please.
I want you to hear too.
What's my little baby got on her mind?
I want to go away.
Go away?
Go where, Peola?
I mean...
by that I mean I want to go away.
And you mustn't see me or own me... or claim me or anything.
I mean, even if you passed me on the street, you'll have to pass me by.
No, Peola!
I know it's terrible of me, Miss Bea.
But you don't know what it is to look white and be black.
You don't know.
I can't go on this way any longer.
I can't give up my baby.
I bore ya.
I nursed ya.
I love ya.
I love ya more than you can guess.
You can't ask your mammy to do this!
You've got to promise me, Mother.
I'm your mammy, child!
I ain't no white mother!
It's too much to ask of me.
I ain't got the spiritual strength to meet it.
I can't hang on no cross!
I ain't got the strength.
You can't ask me to unborn my own child.
I'm sorry, Mother.
I know it's asking a lot, but I've got to live my own life.
Good-bye.
Peola, how can you hurt your mother so?
How can you make her suffer this way?
I'm sorry, Miss Bea, but I can't help it!
[Delilah Sobbing]
Don't cry, Delilah.
Don't cry.
She'll come back to you.
Give her a little time.
A few hard knocks, and she'll come running back to her mother.
That's what mothers are for!
She'll remember that you're here to turn to.
No, Miss Bea.
I've lost my baby.
She won't ever come back.
Of course she will!
I'm going to getJulie to fix you a cup of tea.
And I'll be down again in a few minutes.
Thank you, Miss Bea.
I'll be all right.
Mother.!
Hello.
Darling, you're back!
Yes, darling.
We came in downstairs.
Peola's here, you know.
Yes, I saw her.
I've missed you so.
You've been gone such a long time.
Mmm.
Five days.
It was only supposed to be two.
What's the matter?
You look troubled.
I am troubled.
I've just seen such a tragedy.
Poor Delilah!
What did Peola do?
She's gone.
She's gone away.
Disowned her mother.
Oh, how dreadful!
Darling, if ever anything should ever come between us, it would kill me.
Nothing can, Mother.
We must see that it doesn't.
Don't be silly.
There's no reason.
Come sit down a minute.
How much have you missed me?
Lots, of course.
But not as much as I might have if Stephen hadn't taken your place.
Oh, so I've been supplanted, have I?
But you have got on well?
Oh, have we!
We've dined out every night and danced, seen three plays and two picture galleries and the Bronx Park Zoo.
Well!
Your ichthyologist is grand.
I think we ought to keep him in the family.
He thinks you're beautiful.
He said so.
Did he?
Mm-hmm.
He thinks I'm nice too.
Mother, why do I have to go back to school?
What's this?
Well, after all...
Too much vacation.
You don't want me to turn out to be a stuffy intellectual, do you?
[Laughing]
I have no very serious fears about that, my sweet.
After all, what's the good of algebra and all that stuff to a girl?
This sounds very suspicious to me.
You sure you haven't some handsome football captain in hiding?
No, he isn't a football captain.
But there is someone!
I'll have to look into that.
Right now I want a tub.
I'm so sticky after my night on the train.
Right, darling.
And I'm going out.
Where?
Just out.
Oh, out!
I see.
Out's a big place.
Be back in an hour or two.
See that you are.
I've just begun to talk to you.
[Phone Ringing]
[Ringing] Hello.
Hello, Stephen.
This is Bea.
Oh, hello, Bea!
I'm so glad you're back.
When can I come over?
I'm just getting into the tub.
Give me half an hour.
Jessie tells me you've played the beau in grand style.
She's a most appealing little person, half child and half woman.
I've had a delightful time.
Hurry with that bath, will you?
I'll be waiting for you.
Good-bye, dear.
[Doorbell Buzzing]
Hello.
Well, if it isn't the night prowler herself.
I didn't think you'd get up at all today.
Wasn't it too dreadful, getting home in broad daylight like that?
I never enjoyed anything so much in my life.
No repentance?
Not now.
I'll probably have plenty of repenting to do when Mother finds out.
She got home an hour ago.
Yes, I know.
I've just been talking to her on the phone.
I'm going over there as soon as I get through fixing Horace.
Oh.
Want to come along and have a look at Horace?
I thought Horace was a new species, but he's turned out to be just an ordinary crab.
Stephen, I've just told Mother I don't want to go back to school.
No?
Why not?
I want to stay here.
Stephen, what do you think of me?
I think you're just about the nicest child I've ever known.
Now, don't you begin that child stuff!
At 37, anything under 20 seems a babe in arms.
I think 37 is the ideal age.
Don't you believe it.
It's a dreadful age.
Well, I like it.
You know, I think I like the ones with the big claw best.
Mmm, the bachelors.
Poor lonely hearts.
Why don't you put a lady crab in with them?
They'd tear each other to pieces over her.
How romantic!
For the winner.
He becomes a married crab?
For the time being at least.
Divorce is common?
Statistics show about the same percentage as in the United States.
You're a nut.
Excuse me.
When I marry, I'm never going to be divorced.
How do you know?
Just that... when a girl like me falls in love, it's forever, forever and ever.
What makes you so sure?
Because I am in love.
You are?
Well, don't you think you might've told me?
Is he handsome?
Stephen, it's you.
I love you.
Jessie, my dear...
It's true!
I do love you!
Do you think it's fair to make sport of your elders?
I'm not!
I'm serious, Stephen, terribly serious.
Oh, no, you're not.
You're just a baby.
Oh.
Stephen, we did have fun together, didn't we?
I thought so.
Grand fun.
That night we rode on the ferry to Staten Island, on the top deck under the stars.
And last night, in the open barouche, driving up Fifth Avenue.
That was fun, wasn't it?
For you, I mean.
You bet it was.
No, it wasn't!
You were just putting yourself out to be nice to a child!
A perfectly silly child!
Jessie.!
Hello, dear.
You didn't stay long, did you?
No, I...
I'm just going down to see Delilah.
Jarvis.
How do you do, sir?
Oh, Stephen!
I'm so glad to see you!
It's great to have you back again.
Jessie just came in ahead of you, or have you two come in together?
I stopped in at Stephen's apartment.
I wanted to see how Eph and Maggie were.
Eph and Maggie?
Who in the world are they?
They're two of the crabs.
Oh, now, don't tell me you've named them!
Oh, yes, they all have names.
One's Elmer.
And one's named Fanny.
You didn't know I was getting to be quite an ichthyologist myself.
[Bea] That's splendid.
Mrs. Pullman, can you come right away?
It's Delilah.
Oh, yes.
Excuse me.
Better now?
Yes'm, Miss Bea.
I just somehow...
give out all of a sudden.
'Tain't nothin'.
You go upstairs.
Mary here, she'll do for me fine.
I'm going to stay right here until you're feeling better.
Delilah, if there's anything you want...
Thank you, Miss Bea.
There is somethin'.
I want me a good funeral.
What?
Delilah, what are you talking about?
You're going to be all right.
No, Miss Bea.
I'm all through now.
But that's all right.
I ain't a-worryin' much.
If the Lord is ready, 'tain't for me to hesitate.
Oh, no.
Delilah, I just couldn't do without you.
None of us could.
That's awful sweet of you to say, Miss Bea.
I appreciate it.
But about my funeral.
All right, what about it?
I'll promise you the finest funeral in the world, only you must get well first.
Yes'm.
I paid my dues regular in all my lodges.
And I'm a church member in good standing'.
And I do want a long procession.
I hope all the lodges turn out in full.
And I hope it don't rain.
I want to go meet my maker with plenty of bands playin'.
I want to ride up to heaven... in a white velvet hearse.
Silk velvet.
Purple satin inside the casket.
I wants them colored folks' eyes to bulge out.
And another thing.
I want horses to the hearse.
I don't like the smell of gasoline.
Delilah, you'll have everything you want, but not for years and years to come.
Oh, you.
You and your processions.
Let me tell you some good news.
What, Miss Bea?
I'm going to be married.
Why, Miss Bea!
You see why you've got to get well just as quickly as you can?
Married!
The rabbit's foot did do some good after all, didn't it?
[Jarvis] This way, Doctor, please.
Here's the doctor to see you.
Good evening, Mrs. Pullman.
Good evening, Doctor.
Well, how's the famous Aunt Delilah?
Doctor, this big mountain lying here thinks she isn't going to get well.
[Doctor] We'll have to get her out of that notion.
Better get her undressed.
[Bea] I'll see you before you leave.
Very good.
[Stephen]Jessie.
[Jessie] Why didn't you tell me?
[Stephen] Because your mother asked me not to until...
[Jessie] Until I knew you better, and learned to like you.
[Jessie Crying] Well, I did, didn't I?
I think I'll go and come back later.
Will you tell your mother?
Yes.
Good-bye, Jessie.
Good-bye.
Stephen.
How's Delilah?
I don't know.
The doctor's still with her.
Are you going?
Yes.
I was going to run along and dress and come back for you in about an hour.
Is that all right?
Stephen...
Do you mind if I don't go to dinner?
Of course not.
I'm dreadfully tired, more than I realized.
After the trip and all that's happened today.
I understand.
You go to bed early and get a good night's rest.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yes.
Tomorrow night for dinner.
Yes.
Good night, dear.
Good night.
Oh, there you are, Mother.
Hello, dear.
I like your dress.
It's one I got while you were away.
It's very nice.
Stephen not here yet?
No.
Come sit down.
Mother, would you mind terribly if I went back to school the end of the week?
Darling, what's the matter?
Aren't you enjoying your vacation?
Yes, it's been nice, but...
Then what is it?
You still have another week.
And only yesterday you were asking me why you ever had to go back to school at all.
I was just talking then.
I really do like school.
And I've been thinking, if I do a lot of cramming, I could...
Mother, may I go to Switzerland to finish my last two years?
Switzerland?
Yes. A lot of the girls go.
Even Janie Prentice is talking about it.
There really are a lot of advantages in going.
[Bea] Switzerland...
Mr. Smith.
Show him in.
Hello, Jessie.
Hello, Elmer.
Hello, Elmer.
Well, there you are.
You dodging me?
What have I done?
What are you talking about?
I've been trying to get in touch with you for the last 24 hours.
You won't come near the office, and you won't answer the telephone.
All I can get is the butler, and I can't penetrate past him.
You're too busy!
You're tired!
You can't be disturbed!
I'd never known about Delilah except through the butler.
Why have you gone into the silence?
What's it all about?
Elmer, what is it you want?
I dropped in to tell you that unless we move in the matter of national brands, the deal is going to be called off.
Well, let it!
But they're willing to meet our demands.
You turn the management over to them and keep 50% of the stock.
That relieves you of all responsibility.
And there's more money in it than you can possibly think of.
In fact, there's more money than I can pronounce without stuttering.
Would you like to hear me try?
I don't want to sell.
What?
I don't want to give up active management.
What's the matter?
Before you went south, you couldn't sell quick enough.
I've changed my mind!
You wanted to get from behind that desk, be a human being!
I'm not going to sell!
Isn't that sufficient?
But, Bea...
Must I always give you an account of everything I do or don't do?
Bea.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Forgive me, Elmer.
I really don't know what I'm saying.
I'm so worried and unhappy.
Is it Delilah?
Yes.
Yes, of course it's Delilah.
Elmer, did you see much ofJessie while I was away?
She came to the office a couple of times.
Needed money.
Alone?
Steve was with her.
Why?
Nothing.
I just wondered.
That's all.
Hello.
May I come in?
Hello, Stephen!
Is he boarding here?
Hello, Steve.
Are you following me?
Every time I come here lfind you.
You might do worse.
Might.
Well, so long.
Good night, Bea.
I hope in the morning you'll have better news of Delilah.
Thank you, Elmer.
Hello.
You look so worried, dear.
Isn't Delilah feeling any better?
No, she's much worse.
If we could only find Peola.
She keeps calling for her over and over.

Do you realize I haven't had a moment alone with you since you came back?
Yes, I know.
You were gone five whole days.
I've got a great many things to talk over with you.
So have I. I want to talk to you aboutJessie.
Mother.
Mother, the doctor wants you to come quickly.
Excuse me, Stephen.
Hello, Jessie.
Hello, Stephen.
Anything serious?
Yes, I'm afraid so.

## [Choir Singing, Humming] Where's my baby?
I's your mammy.
Delilah, darling.
I'm all right, Miss Bea.
I'm resting better now.
That's good.
But I'm going... across Jordan... pretty soon now. But...
[Crying]
Peola?
Peola! Doctor, leave me have her picture, please?
It never done her justice.
Miss Bea?
Yes, darling, what is it?
Miss Bea, try and find my baby.
Yes, darling.
If she gets in any troubles, you'll see her through 'em.
Of course I will.
Ain't nothin' bad about Peola.
She didn't mean to harm me when she turned away.
No, of course she didn't.
[Delilah] Just tell her a right sweet good-bye.
Tell her to be a good girl.
Why, Peola ain't... little more than a baby now.
[Gasps]
Doctor!

Please forgive me.
[Peola] I didn't mean it.
[Sobbing]
Mother, it's Peola.
Peola. I didn't mean it, Mother.
Can't you forgive me?
Peola.
Peola.
I killed you.
Peola, come on.
Miss Bea, I killed my own mother.
Don't talk like that.
Come with us.
Step back.
All right, folks.
Step back, please.

## [Funereal Continues]
She worked for me, slaved for me.
Always thought of me first, never of herself.
[Stephen] Bea.
You're so lovely.
Oh!
Darling, let's not wait any longer.
Let's be married right away, tomorrow, and go away on my boat as we planned to do.
Away from business and worry.
What's the matter?
Jessie's in love with you, isn't she?
Oh.
She's told you?
No, she didn't have to.
I knew.
I think I knew right away when I came back from Virginia.
I hope you don't think that I...
Oh, no, no.
I don't, not now.
It just happened.
It isn't serious.
Just a childish infatuation.
She'll get over it.
No, not if I marry you, darling.
What are you saying?
I'm trying to say that we can't go on as we planned.
Bea, you can't mean that.
She'll forget all about me the first attractive boy that comes along.
Don't you see, darling, right now you're the man she loves.
If I were to marry you, she'd always feel I'd come between her and her happiness.
But she's going back to school next week.
She'll find new interests.
Soon she'll laugh at this as a schoolgirl crush.
Oh, no, darling.
Don't you see?
If you're here with me, she'll keep on thinking about you.
She won't even want to come home, where the three of us would have to be together.
And the thought of her unhappiness would come between you and me.
I won't give you up like this.
I love you.
Stephen, I love you more than I ever thought it possible to love anyone.
Then, Bea...
Don't, darling.
Please don't make it any harder for me.
You must see how impossible it is.
Stephen, go back to your islands.
And when she forgets you,
I'll come to you no matter where you are if you still want me.
I shall always want you.
Then I'll come.
Let's say good-bye.
[Jessie] Mother?
Yes, dear?
Where's Stephen?
Isn't he staying for dinner?
No, darling.
Look what I found in the library, tucked away in the corner of the couch.
Delilah's rabbit's foot.
She must've put it there for good luck.
Dear Delilah.
Peola's decided to go back to school.
That's good.
That's what Delilah would've wanted for her.
When did you first meet Delilah?
Oh, a long time ago.
You were just about two.
I'll never forget that morning.
I was giving you a bath, getting you ready for the day nursery.
[Laughs] Why are you laughing?
You kept yelling, "I want my quack-quack!"
Mother, I didn't.
Yes, you did.
I can hear you now.
"I want my quack-quack!
I want my quack-quack!"
Hunger strike? How long has this been going on?
She hasn't had a thing yesterday or today.
- Sending meals up to her regularly?
- Yes, sir. Why don't you jam it down her throat?
It's not that simple, Mr. Andrews.
I'll talk to her myself. Have some food brought up to her.
Yes, sir.
I won't eat a thing until you let me off this boat.
Come now, Ellie. You know I'll have my way.
Not this time, you won't! I'm already married to him.
You'll never live under the same roof with him. I'll see to it.
Get it through your head, King Westley and I are married!
Definitely, legally, actually married! It's over, it's finished.
There's not a thing you can do about it. I'm over 21 and so is he.
While you've been onboard I've arranged to have your marriage annulled.
Annulled. I'll have something to say about that and so will King.
I expect him to.
The vittles. Come in.
I told you not to bring any food in here. Now wait a minute.
This isn't for you.
Put it down here.
Smart, aren't you? So subtle.
Strategy, my dear.
Was it strategy sending those gorillas to drag me away from the Justice of the Peace?
Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
I've won many arguments that way.
Besides not liking him, you haven't got a thing against King. - He's a fake.
- He's one of the best flyers in the country.
He's no good. You married him because I said not to.
You're always telling me what not to do.
Because you've always been a stubborn idiot.
I come from a long line of stubborn idiots. Don't shout so.
You may work up an appetite.
I'll shout if I want to! I'll scream if I want to!
All right, scream.
Let me off this boat or I'll break every piece of furniture in here!
Have a nice piece of juicy steak. You don't have to eat it. Just smell it.
It's a poem.
Lower the boats! Catch her!
Come on, men!
She got away, sir.
Of course, she's too smart for you.
Send a wireless to the Lovington Detective Agency.
"Daughter escaped again.
"Watch roads, airports and train stations in Miami."
Palm Beach, Savannah, Jacksonville New York, Philadelphia.
We're wasting our time. Imagine Ellie Andrews riding on a bus.
I told the old man it was bunk.
Ticket for New York, please.
- Here's your ticket.
- Thank you very much.
Thank you.
What's going on here? I'd like to use that phone.
Go away. This is history in the making.
- What?
- There's a man biting a dog in there.
Heel, boy. I can't stand this any longer.
In a pig's eye, you will.
Listen monkey face, when you fired me, you fired the best news hound your filthy scandal sheet ever had.
You wouldn't know a newspaper story if it kicked you in the pants.
I got all your copy.
Why didn't you tell me you were gonna write it in Greek?
I'd start a new department.
That was free verse, you gas house palooka.
What was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough.
And it's not going to cost us any more!
Gordon.
Did you know he reversed the charge?
What? Why you....
When you get back to New York, you keep far away from this office.
You're fired. You don't work here anymore and you never will.
What'd he say?
So, you're changing your tune?
You're late with your apologies.
I wouldn't go back to work for you if you begged me on your hands and knees!
I hope this'll be a lesson to you.
Did we tell that baby?
- We don't need anymore of his lip.
- You told him, Pete. I guess he knows now, how I feel about his job.
I bet he does, too.
Is my chariot ready?
Your chariot awaiteth withouteth, mighty King.
- Lead on, sire.
- Make way for the king.
Make way for the king.
Long live the king.
Make yourself comfortable with a pleasant pillow.
Pillow, sir?
Driver! If you'll be good enough to move those newspapers, I'll have a seat.
Hey, wait a minute!
What do you think you're doing?
The papers. What's the idea of throwing them out?
The papers? It's a long story, my friend.
I never did like the idea of sitting on newspapers.
I did it once, and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
It actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day.
They followed me all over town and read the news off the seat of my pants.
A fresh guy. What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Listen partner, you may not like my nose, but I do.
I always wear it out in the open so if anybody wants to take a sock at it, they can.
Yeah?
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it?
Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Yeah?
If you keep that up, we won't get anywhere.
Yeah?
You got me. Yeah!
Excuse me, lady. But that upon which you sit is mine.
I beg your pardon?
Now listen, I put up a stiff fight for that seat.
So, if it's just the same to you, scram.
Driver, are these seats reserved? - No.
First come, first serve.
- Thank you.
These seats accommodate two people, don't they?
Maybe they do, maybe they don't.
Thank you.
Move over.
This is a "maybe they do."
If you'd ask me real nice, I might put that bag up there for you.
Next time you drop in, bring your folks.
Get some! Come on, everybody!
Hot dogs, folks!
Rest station, 15 minutes. We'll only be here 15 minutes.
Red hot coffee!
Right around there.
Get the red hot coffee! Hot dogs!
Can't enjoy the ride unless you eat!
He got away.
I found myself in the middle of brush and no sign of the skunk.
I don't know what you're raving about, young man.
- Furthermore, I'm not interested. - Well of all the....
Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag is gone.
My heavens! It's gone!
I knew you'd catch on eventually.
- What am I going to do now?
- Don't tell me your ticket was in it.
No, got that all right. But not my money.
All I have here is $4.
You can wire home for money in Jacksonville.
No, I can't.
- Yes, I guess I will.
- I'll tell the driver about your bag.
Thank you, I'd rather you didn't.
Don't be a fool. You've lost your bag. The company should pay for it.
- What's your name?
- I don't want it reported!
That's silly. The company will take care of it.
Can you understand English? Would you please keep out of my affairs?
I want to be left alone.
Why, you ungrateful brat.
Board!
All aboard!
Jacksonville, 30 minutes for breakfast.
Only 30 minutes for breakfast.
Just 30 minutes. That's all. No more.
I'm so sorry.
Silly, isn't it?
Why, everybody's gone!
Thank you for that, very much.
- We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
That was foolish of me.
Why didn't you shove me away?
I hated to wake you up. You look kind of pretty asleep.
How about some breakfast?
No thank you. No, I'm going to the Windsor Hotel.
Windsor? You'll never make it in time. We leave in a half an hour.
No, they'll wait for me.
Driver, I'm going to be a few minutes late. Be sure to wait for me.
Yeah?
Yes.
Where's the bus to New York?
It left about 20 minutes ago.
But that's ridiculous. I was on that bus. I told them to wait.
I'm sorry, miss, but it's gone.
Good morning. Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
Seems to me, I've already thanked you for that.
What time's the next bus?
8:00 tonight.
8:00? That's 12 hours.
Sorry, miss.
What's wrong? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?
Why are you so excited? You missed it, too.
Yeah, I missed it too.
Don't tell me you did it on my account.
I hope you haven't any idea that what happened last night is....
Young man, you needn't concern yourself about me.
I can take care of myself.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it. Here's your ticket.
My ticket?
I found it on the seat.
Thank you. It must have fallen out of my purse.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews.
- What are you talking about?
- You won't get away with it.
Your father will stop you before you get halfway to New York.
You must have me confused with someone else.
Quit kidding. It's all over the front page.
I've always been curious to know what kind of a girl would marry a front-page aviator like King Westley.
Take my advice. Grab the next bus back to Miami.
That guy's a phoney.
I didn't ask for your advice.
That's right. You didn't.
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
What for?
You probably could get some money out of him.
I never thought of that.
If you promise not to do it, I'll pay you as much as he will.
You won't gain a thing by giving me up.
I'm willing to make it worth your while.
I've got to get to New York without being stopped.
It's very important to me.
I'd pay you now, only all I had when I jumped off the yacht was a watch.
I had to pawn it to get these clothes.
I'll give you my address. You can contact me in New York.
Never mind.
I had you pegged right from the jump.
Just the spoiled brat of a rich father.
The only way you get anything is to buy it.
You're in a jam and all you can think of is your money.
It never fails, does it?
Ever hear of the word "humility"?
No, you wouldn't.
It never occurred to you to say "Please, Mister, I'm in trouble.
That'd bring you down off your high horse.
I'll tell you something to ease your mind.
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm not interested in your money or your problem.
You, King Westley, your father.
You send telegrams here?
I'm just fine, thanks. And how are you?
"To Joe Gordon, in care of New York Mail, New York.
"Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap.
"I know where Ellen Andrews is." No, do you really?
Go on. Send the telegram.
"How would you like to have the story? You big tub of...."
Mush.
"Tub of mush. Well, try and get it.
"What I said about never writing another line for you still goes.
"Are you burning? Peter Warne."
That'll be $2.60.
- Send it collect.
- Collect?
Collect.
Bus leaving for Savannah, Charleston, Columbia, Greensboro, Richmond Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York....
Hi, sister. All alone? My name's Shapeley.
May as well get acquainted, it's a long trip.
Gets tiresome. Especially for somebody like you.
You look like you've got class.
Yes, with a capital "K". I'm the guy that knows class when he sees it.
Believe you me. Ask any of the boys. They'll tell you.
Shapeley sure knows how to pick them.
Shapeley's the name and that's the way I like them.
You made no mistake sitting next to me.
Most girls you meet on the bus ain't nothing to write home to the wife about.
You gotta be awful careful who you hit it up with.
You can't be too particular, neither.
What's the matter, you ain't saying much?
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance.
That's pretty good. "Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance."
Well shut my big, nasty mouth.
Looks like you're one up on me.
There's nothing I like better than to meet a high-class mama that can snap back at you.
The colder they are, the hotter they get.
That's what I always say.
Yes, sir.
When a cold mama gets hot, boy how she sizzles.
Now you're just my type.
Believe me, sister, I could go for you in a big way.
"Fun-on-the-side Shapeley," they call me. With accent on the "fun".
Believe you me.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Looks like you're two up on me now.
Hey, you.
- There's a seat over there for you.
- What's the idea?
I'd like to sit next to my wife, if you don't mind.
- Your wife?
- Yes.
Come on.
Yeah. Sure, excuse me. You know, I was just....
Sure. Excuse me, miss. I was just trying to make things pleasant.
Excuse me, I....
I didn't mean anything, Doc.
- No offence, Doc. - No.
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice gets on my nerves.
What'd you do all day?
Ran in and out of doorways. Trying to keep out of the rain.
Your clothes are all wet.
Here.
You're as helpless as a baby. Thank you.
Here you are, folks.
Cigars, cigarettes, chewing gum, candy, magazines.
Here, boy.
- Yes, ma'am.
- A box of chocolates, please.
- Never mind. She doesn't want it.
- But....
- Of course, I do. What do you mean?
- Beat it.
Well, you've got your nerve. Here, boy!
$1 .60.
You had $4 last night.
How will you get to New York at this rate?
That's none of your business.
You're on a budget from now on.
- Just a minute. You can't--
- Shut up.
- What's the matter, officer?
- Bridge washed out.
Looks like we can't get through till morning.
If any passengers want a place to sleep you'll find an auto camp up yonder a piece.
- Where? - Right over there.
See those lights?
Dyke's Auto camp.
All right, thanks. Hey, brat.
Are you talking to me?
Yeah. Come on, we're stopping here for the night.
Hey! Come on, we're all set.
Good evening. Hope you and your husband rest comfortable.
Come on! What are you going to do, stay out there all night?
Darn clever, these Armenians?
Yeah, it's a gift.
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Yeah. I forgot to tell you about that. I registered as Mr. and Mrs.
You did?
What am I expected to do? Leap for joy?
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Your ego is absolutely colossal.
Yeah, it's not bad. How's yours?
You know, compared to you, my friend Shapeley's an amateur.
Just whatever gave you any idea I'd stand for this?
Now wait a minute. Let's get this straightened out right now.
If you're nursing any silly notion that I'm interested in you, forget it.
You're just a headline to me.
A headline?
You're not a newspaper man, are you?
Chalk up one for your side.
Now listen. You want to get to King Westley, don't you?
All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story. Exclusive.
A day-to-day account. All about your mad fight to happiness.
I need that story. Between you and me, I've got to have it.
Isn't that just too cute.
There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there?
You've got everything nicely figured out for yourself. Including this.
This? Well, that's a matter of simple mathematics.
These cabins cost $2 a night.
I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishment.
Thank you very much, sir. You've been very kind. It's all right with me.
Go on out in the storm.
But I'm going to follow you. Yeah.
And if you get tough, I'll just have to turn you over to your old man.
Right now. Savvy?
That's my whole plot in a nutshell.
A simple story for simple people.
You behave yourself, I'll see you get to King Westley.
If not, I'll just have to spill the beans to Papa.
Now, which of these beds do you prefer?
This one? All right.
That, I suppose, makes everything quite all right.
This?
I like privacy when I retire. Yes, I'm very delicate in that respect.
Prying eyes annoy me.
Behold the walls of Jericho.
Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet.
But a lot safer.
You see, I have no trumpet.
Now to show you my heart's in the right place I'll give you my best pair of pyjamas.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
You don't want to join the Israelites? All right.
Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses. There's a funny thing about that.
Quite a study in psychology.
No two men do it alike.
I once knew a man who kept his hat on until he was completely undressed.
Now he made a picture.
Years later, his secret came out. He wore a toupee.
I have a method all my own.
If you'll notice, the coat came first. Then the tie. Then the shirt.
Now, according to Hoyle, after that the pants should be next.
There's where I'm different.
I go for the shoes next.
First the right. Then the left.
After that, it's every man for himself.
Still with me, brat?
Don't be a sucker.
A good night's rest will do you a lot of good.
Besides, you got nothing to worry about.
The walls of Jericho will protect you from the big bad wolf.
"Who's afraid of the big bad wolf? The big bad wolf
"The big bad wolf
"She's afraid of the big bad wolf Tra, la, la, la, la"
Would you mind please, putting out the light?
No, not at all.
I wish you'd take those things off the walls of Jericho.
Excuse me.
By the way, what's your name?
What's that?
Who are you?
Who, me?
I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night.
I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
You've got a name, haven't you?
Yeah, I got a name. Peter Warne.
Peter Warne.
I don't like it.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne.
The pleasure is all mine, Mrs. Warne.
- Another message, sir.
- What is it? What is it?
It's from Charleston. "Checking every northbound train.
"Also assigned 20 operators to watch main highways.
"No sign of her yet. Will continue to do all possible.
"Signed, Lovington Detective Agency."
It's just the same as all the others.
- Yes, sir?
- I said I was in a hurry to get to New York. - What are we crawling for?
- I got it wide open.
- All right, step on it.
I hope she's all right. All right?
Of course, she's all right. What could happen to her?
- Nothing, sir.
- Then shut up about it.
Hello?
Hey, mister.
Hello.
What's the matter, you not up yet?
- What time is it?
- 8:00. Here.
It's a toothbrush, thanks.
My dress, you had it pressed. Come on.
Breakfast will be ready soon.
You sweet thing. Where'd you get it pressed?
I'll count to 10.
If you're not out of bed by then I'll drag you out myself.
- One, two, three, four, five....
- I really think you would!
I'm out!
I'm out!
You'll find the showers just behind the second cottage.
Outside?
All the best homes have them outside.
I can't go out like this. - Like what?
- Like this.
I have no robe.
Here, use mine.
Thanks.
Make it snappy.
Wait, it's not my fault. You got the sleeve.
- Here are my puppets.
- Thanks.
Where'd you say the showers were?
Here's a towel.
Thank you.
You're kind of little, aren't you?
Where's the shower?
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
I'll find it myself.
Are the showers in there?
They ain't out here.
Thank you.
Can't a body have a little privacy around here?
You want a shower around here, you'll stand in line.
Hi, sister. You remember me, Shapeley?
Say, I'm sorry about last night.
Didn't know you was married to that guy. You should've told me right off.
High time you got back.
I met some very interesting women at the showers.
We got chatting about this and that. You know how time flies.
Come on.
My, my. Scrambled eggs. Egg.
One egg. One donut, black coffee. That's your ration till lunch.
Any complaints?
No. No complaints.
I'd have cream for your coffee, but I'd be buying a whole pint.
You don't have to apologise to me.
You don't know how much I appreciate all this.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
Must be the spring.
I thought maybe "believe you me" told you some more snappy stories.
No. He apologised for last night.
Said he didn't know we were married.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be.
- Donut? - Thanks.
You think this whole business is silly?
Running away and all. No.
Makes too good a story.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat.
Perhaps I am. Although, I don't see how I can be.
Spoiled people are used to having their way.
I never have. On the contrary.
I've always been told what to do and how to do it and when and with whom.
Can you believe, this is the first time I've ever been alone with a man? Yeah.
It's a wonder I'm not panic-stricken.
You're doing all right.
Thanks.
Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even bodyguards.
It's been a lot of fun.
One consolation, you can never get lonesome.
It has its moments.
It's become a sort of game, trying to outwit father's detectives.
I did once. Actually went shopping without a bodyguard. It was swell.
I felt absolutely immoral.
It didn't last long, they found me in a department store.
I was so mad, I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw.
Guess who was in it?
Santa Claus? Ghandi?
King Westley was in it.
- Is that how you met him? - Yes.
We rode around all afternoon.
Father was frantic.
By 6:00, he was having all the rivers dragged.
Where'd you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Now don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk. Of course you shouldn't.
You don't know how.
Dunking is an art. Don't let it soak so long.
A dip and sock, into your mouth.
You leave it in too long, it gets soft and falls off.
It's all a matter of timing. I'll write a book about it.
Thanks, professor.
Just goes to show you. $20 million, and you don't know how to dunk.
I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
How do I know who you are? I never saw you before.
You can't go around bothering my tenants.
There's no girl by that name here.
How do I know you're detectives?
Show him your credentials, Mac.
Detectives.
That's father at work. Peter, what'll I do?
Maybe I can jump out of the window.
They won't see me.
Get yourself all mussed up.
Get your hair down over your eyes and undo your buttons.
I got a letter from Aunt Bella last week.
She said if we don't stop over in Wilkes-Barre, she'll never forgive us.
What are you talking about?
The baby's due next month. They want us to come.
She saw your sister on the street the other day. Said she's looking swell.
Come in.
I hope Aunt Bella has a boy, don't you?
Grandma says it's gonna be a girl. She hasn't missed calling one in years.
Man here to see you, sweetheart. Who, me?
You wanna see me?
What's your name?
- Are you addressing me? - Yeah.
What's your name?
Wait a minute. That's my wife you're talking to.
What do you mean coming here? What do you want?
- We're looking for somebody.
- Fine, but don't come busting in here.
This isn't a public park.
I got news to take a sock at you.
- Take it easy. - The men are detectives.
Even if they're the whole police department they can't bust in here, questioning my wife.
Don't get so excited. He asked you a simple question.
How many times have I told you not to butt in?
You don't have to lose your temper!
As usual. Every time I try to protect you.
At the elks dance, when that big Swede hit on you.
He did not! I told you a million times.
He kept pawing you all over the dance floor.
He didn't. You were drunk. Nuts!
Just like your old man.
Once a plumber's daughter, always a plumber's daughter.
There ain't an ounce of brains in your family.
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough!
- Shut up!
- You see what you've done?
Sorry, but you see, we've gotta check up on everybody.
We're looking for a girl named Ellen Andrews.
Daughter of that big Wall Street mogul.
Too bad you're not looking for a plumber's daughter.
Quit bawling!
I told you they were a perfectly nice married couple.
You weren't bad, jumping in like that.
- You've got a brain.
- You're not so bad, yourself.
We could start a two-people stock company.
Things get tough, we'll play to small town auditoriums.
We'll call this one, "The Great Deception."
What about "Cinderella" or a real hot love story?
No, too mushy.
I like mushy stuff.
Quit bawling!
Bus leaves in five minutes!
- What?
- Your bus leaves in five minutes.
Holy smoke, we're not even packed yet.
I'm starting to think you couldn't find your way home.
This is the last session....
- Yeah?
- Telegram for you. - Bring it in.
- Another wire from Peter Warne.
Warne? Throw it in the wastebasket. Wait a minute.
"Have I got a story. Stop. It's getting hotter and hotter.
"Hope you're the same."
- Collect? - Yes.
- If you accept another one, you're fired.
- Yes, sir.
And that gives me an idea for all of you.
I want action, Lovington, action.
- We can't do the impossible.
- It isn't impossible.
She's somewhere between here and Miami.
I want her found.
- I put extra men on, the whole way.
- That's not enough.
Send in Clark and Brown.
- You sure she isn't with King Westley? - No.
He's being trailed 24 hours a day.
He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
I'm worried. After all, something might have happened to her.
I don't think so.
Brown, arrange a radio broadcast. Coast-to-coast hook up.
Offer a reward of $10,000 for information on her whereabouts.
Clark, send the story to all of the newspapers.
Some out-of-town papers may not have a picture of her.
Wire this to them. I want the story to break right away.
Now we'll get some action!
Fine, that's fine.
You know that one about the man who flew on the trapeze?
Yeah.
"Once I was happy but now I'm forlorn
"Like an old coat that is tattered and torn
"Left in this wide world to weep and to mourn
"Betrayed by a maid in her teens
"This maid that I loved she was handsome
"And I tried all I knew how to please
"But I never could please her one-quarter so well
"As the man on the flying trapeze
"He flies through the air with the greatest of ease
"The daring young man on the flying trapeze
"His actions are graceful, all the girls he does please
"And my love he has stolen away"
I know the second verse there.
"Now he'd play with a miss like a cat with a mouse
"His eyes would undress every girl in the house
"Perhaps he is better described as a louse And still people came just the same
"Now he smiles from the bar on the people below
"And one night he smiled on my love
"She blew him a kiss
"And she hollered bravo And he hung by his schnozzle from above
"He floats through the air with the greatest of ease
"Daring young man on the flying trapeze His actions are graceful
"All the girls he does please And my love he has stolen away"
Do you mind if I take the third one?
"I wept and I whimpered I simpered for weeks
"While she spent her time with the circus' freaks
"The tears were like hailstones that rolled down my cheeks
"Alas, Alack and Alaska
"I went to this fellow the villain, and I said
"I'll see that you get your deserts
"His thumb to his nose he put up with a sneer
"He sneered once again and said no
"He flies through the air with the greatest of ease
"That daring young man on the flying trapeze
"His actions are graceful The girls he does please
"My love he has stolen away"
- Everybody keep your seats.
- Thank the man for me, Peter.
It's the first comfortable position I've been in all night.
"She flies through the air with the greatest of ease
"The daring young--"
What's the matter with you? Somebody help.
Something happened to her.
Look how pale she is.
Let's give her a chance to snap out of it.
She'll be all right.
We ain't ate nothing since yesterday.
What happened to your money?
Ma spent it all on the tickets. We didn't know it was gonna be so much.
We shouldn't have come, I guess.
But Ma said there was a job waiting for her in New York and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
She'll be all right when she's had something to eat.
The next time we come to, you buy some food. Now come on.
I shouldn't ought to take this. Ma'll get mad. Don't tell her.
You don't want her to get sick again.
No, but you might need it.
Come on.
I got millions.
Here. - Thanks.
- Come on, go back.
Better phone for some help. Go phone if you want to.
The nearest town is 10 miles away.
Yeah?
Say, buddy. Like to take a look at my paper?
Travelling like this, you lose track of what's going on in the world.
Take that story there, for instance.
If I was to see that dame, you know what I'd do?
No.
I'd go fifty-fifty with you.
Why?
Because I don't believe in hogging.
A bird that figures that way always ends up behind the eight ball.
That's what I always say.
What's on your mind?
Five G's or I crab the works.
Let's get away from here and talk this over privately.
I knew she wasn't your wife all the time.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need. - You made no mistake, believe me.
- I can use a smart guy like you.
- When you're talking to old man Shapeley...
- Can you make a gat?
Huh?
A gat. A rod.
- Got any fireworks on you? - No.
I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll give you one of them.
May have trouble up north. Have to shoot it out with the cops.
If you manage, those five G's are as good as in the bag. Maybe more.
I'll talk to the Killer, he'll take care of you.
Killer? Yeah.
The big boy. The boss of the outfit.
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
What else, stupid?
You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward?
$10, 000? Chicken feed.
Now listen, we're holding that dame for a million smackers.
Say, I didn't know it was anything like this. You see, I've got....
What's the matter? You getting yellow?
I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't afford to get....
Pipe down your mug before I....
What are you trying to do, tell the whole world about it?
Listen, you're into this thing and you're staying in, get me?
You know too much.
I won't say anything, honest I won't. How do I know that?
I got a notion to plug you.
- Why should I take a chance with you?
- Trust me, mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
Yeah?
What's your name?
Oscar Shapeley.
- Where do you live?
- Orange, New Jersey.
Got a couple of kids? Yes, sir.
Just babies. A little golden-haired girl.
- You love them, don't you?
- Yes, I do.
You're not thinking of--
- You keep your trap shut, all right?
- Sure. - If you don't....
- I'll keep my trap shut.
You ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
Bugs Dooley? No.
He was a nice guy, just like you. And he made a big mistake one day.
Got a little too talkative.
- You know what happened to his kid? - No.
I can't tell you.
But when Bugs heard about it he blew his brains out.
That's terrible.
He had it coming to him. He talked too much. I never talk.
I never say a word. Word of honour.
I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids. Okay.
Just remember that.
Now beat it. Sure, mister.
Thanks. I always knew you guys were--
Come on, scram. And stay away from that bus. Sure.
Anything you say.
- You wouldn't shoot me in the back?
- If you don't beat it....
I'm going.
Why do we have to leave the bus? Come on.
Don't ask so many questions.
Why?
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
At the rate he's going, he's probably crossed two state lines by this time.
Why did we have to leave the bus?
When Shapeley stops running, he's going to start thinking, isn't he?
I've been doing a little thinking myself.
The next town we come to, you better wire your father.
What's the matter, are you weakening? No.
I was just thinking of you. A starvation diet may not agree with you.
Did you give that child all your money?
I gave him nothing. You were the big-hearted gal.
All the money I had was that ten spot.
So I've been thinking you better wire your father. No, sir.
I started out for New York and I'm going to get there if I have to starve all the way.
Okay.
What is this strange power this man Westley has over you women?
Here, take these.
- Hold on to them. Get up on that log.
- That?
Get up on the log.
I wish you'd stop being playful. So sorry.
You know, this is the first time in years I've ridden piggyback.
This isn't piggyback.
- Of course it is.
- You're crazy.
I remember distinctly my father taking me for a piggyback ride.
- And he carried you like this?
- Yes.
Your father didn't know beans about piggyback riding.
My uncle has four children.
I've seen them ride piggyback.
I'll bet there isn't a good piggyback rider in your family.
I never knew a rich man who could piggyback ride.
You're prejudiced.
Show me a good piggy backer. I'll show you a real human.
Take Abraham Lincoln for instance. A natural born piggy backer.
Where do you get off with that stuffed-shirt family of yours?
My father was a great piggy backer.
Here, hold this a minute.
Thank you.
How long does this keep up? My feet are killing me.
This looks like the best spot.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a good imitation of it.
Peter?
What?
I'm awfully hungry.
It's just your imagination.
No it isn't.
I'm hungry and scared.
You can't be hungry and scared both at the same time.
Well, I am.
If you're scared, it scares the hunger out of you.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
All right, you win. Let's forget about it.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
Holy smoke! Why did I ever get mixed up with you?
If I had any sense, I'd be in New York by this time.
What about your story?
Taking a married woman back to her husband.
I turned out to be the prize sucker.
All right, come on. Your bed's all ready.
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
- Then take them off.
- What?
All right, don't take them off. Do what you please, but shut up about it.
You're becoming awfully disagreeable lately.
You just snap my head off every time I open my mouth.
If being with me is so distasteful to you, you can leave.
You can leave any time you see fit.
Nobody's holding you here.
I can get along.
Peter?
Peter!
- What's the matter?
- I was so scared! What's got into you?
I left for a minute to find you something to eat.
I know but....
Here, eat your head off.
I don't want it now.
- I thought you said you were hungry.
- I was, but--
But what?
I was so scared, it scared the hunger--
Holy jumping catfish. You drive a guy crazy.
It's liable to get chilly before morning.
Better use this.
What are you thinking about?
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
What did you say we're supposed to be doing?
Hitchhiking.
You've given me a very good example of the hiking.
Where does the hitching come in?
It's a little early yet. No cars out.
If it's the same to you I'm going to sit right here and wait until they come.
You got a toothpick?
- What's the matter?
- I got hay in my teeth.
No, I haven't got a toothpick. Here, I got a penknife, though.
Now hold still.
- Be careful.
- All right. Where is it?
All right, now hold still.
Here. Get it?
Thanks.
You should have swallowed that.
You won't have any breakfast, you know?
You needn't rub it in.
- What are you eating?
- Carrots.
- Raw?
- Want one?
No. Why didn't you get me something I could eat?
That's right, I forgot. The idea of offering a raw carrot to an Andrews.
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you, do you?
Have one of these. Best thing for you, carrots.
I hate the horrid things.
I wish you wouldn't talk so much. Now we let a car get away.
And suppose nobody stops for us?
They'll stop all right. It's a matter of knowing how to handle them.
And you're an expert I suppose. Expert.
And I'll write a book about it. Call it "The Hitchhiker's Hail."
There's no end to your accomplishments, is there?
- You think it's simple? - No.
Well, it is simple.
It's all in that old thumb, see?
Some people do it like this. Or like this.
All wrong. Never get anywhere.
The poor things.
But that old thumb never fails. It's all a matter of how you do it, though.
Now you take No. 1, for instance.
That's a short jerky movement, like this. That shows independence.
You don't care if they stop or not.
- Clever.
- No. 2, that's a little wider movement.
Smile goes with this one, like this.
That means you got a brand-new story about the farmer's daughter.
You figured that out all by yourself?
That's nothing. No. 3, that's a pip. That's the pitiful one.
When you're broke and hungry, everything looks black.
It's a long sweeping movement like this. Gotta follow through, though.
That's amazing.
But it's no good, if you haven't got a long face to go with it.
Here comes a car. Okay.
Now watch me. I'm gonna use No. 1.
Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
I still got my eye on the thumb.
Something must have gone wrong. I'll try No. 2.
When you get to 100, wake me up.
I don't think I'll write that book after all.
Think of all the fun you had, though.
You mind if I try?
You?
Don't make me laugh.
You're such a smart aleck. Nobody knows anything but you.
I'll stop a car and I won't use my thumb.
What are you gonna do?
It's a system all my own.
Aren't you going to give me a little credit?
What for?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
Why didn't you take off all your clothes? You could have stopped 40 cars.
I'll remember that when we need 40 cars.
So, you're just married? That's pretty good.
But if I was young, that's the way I'd spend my honeymoon. Hitchhiking.
Yes, sir. "Hitchhiking down the highway
"Of love on a honeymoon
"Hitchhiking down the highway, down" Aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
Tonsil?
Me? No.
Me burn a tonsil? "My tonsils won't burn"
All right, let it go.
"Turn"
How about a bite to eat?
- That would be lovely.
- No thanks, we're not hungry.
Young people in love are never hungry. No.
"Young people in love
"Are very seldom hungry
"People in love are very seldom hungry"
What were you going to do? Gold dig that guy for a meal?
Sure, I was. No fooling, I'm hungry.
Eat a carrot.
No.
I'm going in to ask him.
You do and I'll break your neck.
Come on, let's get out of here. Stretch our legs.
I'm sorry....
That's all right.
Hey! Come here!
You've got my suitcase!
What happened to you? I was worried. - Get in.
- Look at your face!
You've got a cut! Well, what happened?
A road thief.
Picks people up, runs off with their things. What a racket.
How'd you get the car?
I gave him a black eye for it and had to tie him up to a tree.
Can't be much gas left in this thing.
Gotta start promoting some.
Better take the things out of the pocket of that coat.
That'll be good for ten gallons.
I haven't changed my mind, Westley. I want you to understand that.
I don't like you. Never have. Never will.
Now that's clear enough, isn't it?
You've made it evident by your threats of annulment.
It hasn't worried me for a minute.
Ellie and I got married because we love each other.
She's proving it.
As far as I'm concerned, there's going to be no annulment.
I see. You've got hold of a good thing and you're going to hang on to it?
All right, you win. I'll just have to get used to you.
I admit, I'm licked. But it's only because I'm worried.
If I don't find her soon, I'll go crazy.
I could have helped if it hadn't been for you.
I've been watched so closely--
I know. Well, you can help now. I've got a room full of reporters in there.
Now, I want you to make a statement.
Say that we've talked things over and come to an understanding.
And that if she returns I won't interfere with your marriage.
- All right? - Yeah, that's quite all right.
Okay.
I hope you and your wife spend a pleasant week with us.
So do I. Thank you. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
- All right, brat.
- Any luck? Yeah.
He finally agreed to let us have a cabin.
What about the money?
I talked him out of that idea. He thinks we're staying a week.
- I must think something up before morning. - That's swell.
Yeah?
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, I think it's foolish.
I told you there's no use in staying here.
We can make New York in three hours.
I thought you were in a hurry to get back.
Whoever heard of getting in at 3:00 in the morning?
Everybody will be asleep.
Okay. Cottage no. 6.
There you go, trusting people again. How many times did I tell you--
But he looked like a nice, upright young fellow, Ma.
We're on the last lap.
Tomorrow morning, you'll be in the arms of your husband.
Yeah.
You'll have a great story, won't you? Yeah.
Swell.
Thanks.
We certainly outsmarted your father.
I guess you ought to be happy.
Am I going to see you in New York?
Nope.
Why not?
I don't make it a policy to run around with married women.
There's no harm in your coming to see us.
Not interested.
Won't I ever see you again?
What for? I've served my purpose!
I brought you back to King Westley.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
Have you ever been in love, Peter?
Me?
Yes.
Haven't you ever thought about it at all?
It seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't?
If I could ever meet the right sort of girl.
Where are you gonna find her?
Somebody that's real. Somebody that's alive.
They don't come that way anymore.
Have I ever thought about it?
I've even been sucker enough to make plans.
I saw an island in the Pacific once.
Never been able to forget it.
That's where I'd like to take her.
She'd have to be the sort of a girl who'd jump in the surf with me and love it as much as I did.
Nights when you, the moon and the water all become one.
You feel you're part of something big and marvellous.
That's the only place to live.
The stars are so close overhead you feel you could reach up and stir them around.
I've been thinking about it.
Boy, if I could ever find a girl who was hungry for those things.
Take me with you, Peter. Take me to your island.
I want to do all those things you talked about.
You better go back to your bed.
I love you. Nothing else matters. But we can run away.
Everything will take care of itself.
Please, Peter I can't let you out of my life now.
I couldn't live without you.
You'd better go back to your bed.
I'm sorry.
Did you mean that? Would you really go?
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York.
That bag's worth $25.
I got a bag. I got one for Christmas--
Here's what I'll do.
I'll come back in the morning and buy it back from you with a $10 profit.
- What do you say?
- I ain't got a hat. - What?
- I ain't got a hat.
Well, you got one now. Come on, fill her up.
Where you been all this time? Everybody's been asking about you.
Get me one drink.
Nobody disturbs me for the next half hour.
Sure, boss.
Hello, Agnes.
- Don't. He'll shoot you on sight.
- Haven't been shot at in days.
- Get out of here! Get out!
- Now listen, Joe. Don't "Joe" me.
All right, Joe.
You know I've always liked you.
Anytime I could help you, ran across a good story I came running to you with it.
I got one now.
The wires were on the level. The biggest scoop ever.
- It's yours. - About the Andrews kid?
I've got it all written up, ready to go.
A $1,000? Get out of here before--
Don't get sore. You gotta do this for me.
I need a $1,000 and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
What's the $1,000 for?
To tear down the walls of Jericho.
Never mind.
If I told you that Ellen Andrews will annul her marriage?
- She'll marry somebody else.
- You're drunk.
Would such a story be worth $1,000 to you?
- If it was on the level.
- I got it, Joe.
- Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
- I am.
- You?
- Yes.
Now I know you're drunk. I'm going home. Don't annoy me anymore.
For heaven sakes! Stop being an editor for a minute.
We know each other. You ought to know when I'm serious.
This is on the level. I met her on a bus from Miami.
I've been with her every minute. I'm in love with her.
You gotta get me this money now, quick. Minutes count.
She's waiting for me outside Philadelphia.
I gotta get right back. She doesn't even know I'm gone.
A guy can't propose to a gal without a cent in the world, can he?
What a story. On her way to join husband, Ellen Andrews--
That's it.
Let me see that a minute.
Zeke! I told you, you couldn't trust him.
He's gone.
Who?
The fella who was gonna stay a week.
He skipped and took the car with him, too.
We wouldn't have known till morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.
Get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
There ain't nothing we can do if he's gone.
See that? They're gone.
Looks like it, don't it? What's this?
Ma! Here's the woman.
- What's the matter?
- Where's your husband?
- Husband?
- Yes, if he is your husband.
- Isn't he here? - No, he ain't.
The car's gone, too.
You got any money?
- Then you'll have to git!
Yeah. You'll have to git.
Please, may I use your phone? I've got to call New York.
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone call.
Go to the sheriff's office, a quarter mile down the road.
And listen, next time you better not come back here.
I run a respectable place.
- Thanks, you saved my life. - Okay.
So long kid and good luck.
Goodbye. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful.
For my dough, he's still the best newspaper man in the business.
Get Hank, quick. Boy, what a yarn.
Hold up the morning edition.
Break down the front page. We'll have a new layout.
Send in a couple of rewrite men. And Hank, listen. Don't do a thing.
I've got a story that'll make your hair curl. Wait a minute.
Don't annoy me, I'm busy.
Agnes, send Mike in here!
Dig up all the pictures on that Andrews kid.
And Hank, listen, get Haley out of bed.
I want a cartoon and I want it quick.
Westley's in it. He's waiting at the church with tears on his face.
The bride didn't show up.
Old Man Andrews is laughing his head off.
Everything exaggerated.
Snap into it. What is it?
Ellen Andrews? You're crazy. I'm not.
She phoned her father from an auto camp asking him to come.
He's getting a police escort and Westley's going along.
Yes, she's been travelling by bus.
When she found out her father and Westley made up, she phoned.
Okay, grab a car and stay with them. Get Hank again.
Agnes, get me a doctor, I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown.
Hank, forget what I told you. I'm having a nightmare.
Agnes, you call the police department. Tell them to find Peter Warne.
Send out a general alarm. I want that dirty crook pinched.
You want us?
Change the front page!
Ellen Andrews just phoned her father.
She's going home. She found out Dad withdrew his objections.
She gave herself up. Spread it all over the place!
Play it up big! Major league! "Love Triumphant." Go on, hop to it.
Okay.
Come on, baby. We gotta get there before she wakes up.
Can't you drive any faster?
"Young people in love are never hungry"
Come on, baby. We've got a police escort.
Come on, baby. They can't make a sucker out of us.
All right, come on. Step back. Give them room.
Come on, step back.
How about a picture for the paper, Mr. Andrews?
Wait till she gets home. Later, boys. Later.
"He floats through the air with the greatest of ease
"The daring young man on the flying trapeze"
Get that thing out of the way!
Keep your britches on, we'll get it out.
Hey, you darn fool!
Ellen Andrews is going to marry that Westley guy again.
Gordon's out back some place.
When he comes in, give him this. Tell him I was just kidding.
- You can't get a thing done around here.
- Peter was just in. - What?
- He left this money.
- He said he was just kidding.
- Where is he?
- There he goes.
I'm sorry, it was just a little gag. I thought I'd have some fun with you.
Yeah, sure you had me going for a little while, too.
- It wouldn't have made a bad story at that. - No, great.
But that's the way things go.
You think you've got a great yarn and then something comes along and messes up the finish.
And there you are. Yeah.
Where am I?
When you sober up, come in and talk to me.
Thanks.
Ellie?
Hello, Dad.
I knocked several times.
I'm sorry. I must have been daydreaming.
Everything's set. Creating quite a furore, too.
Great stunt King is going to pull.
Stunt?
Yeah, he's landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Yes, I heard.
Personally, I think it's silly, too.
You look lovely, child.
Are you pleased with the gown?
Ellie?
The gown. Yes, it's nice, isn't it?
What's the matter, child?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You haven't changed your mind about King have you?
No.
Because if you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him.
Well, you gave me such a scare when I couldn't find you.
You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
I'm sorry, Father.
I wouldn't hurt you for anything in the world.
Aren't you happy?
I thought so.
I knew there was something on your mind. There, now.
What's the matter?
You haven't fallen in love with someone else, have you?
Have you?
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby.
This must be serious.
Where'd you meet him?
On the road.
Now don't tell me you've fallen in love with a bus driver?
Oh, no. Who is he?
I don't know very much about him.
Except that I love him.
If it's as serious as all that, we'll move heaven and earth to--
No, it's no use. He despises me.
Come now.
Yes, he does. He despises everything about me.
He says that I'm spoiled and selfish and pampered and thoroughly insincere.
Ridiculous.
He doesn't think so much of you, either.
Well, I--
And he blames you for everything that's wrong with me.
He says you raised me stupidly.
And now that's a fine man to fall in love with.
He's marvellous.
What are we going to do about it? Where is he?
- I don't know.
- I'd like to have a talk with him.
It wouldn't do any good. I practically threw myself at him.
Under the circumstances, don't you think we'd better call this thing off?
No, I'll go through with it.
But that's silly. Seeing the way you feel about him.
No, it doesn't matter. I don't want to stir up any more trouble.
I've done it all my life.
I've made your life miserable. And mine, too.
I'm tired, father. I'm tired of running around in circles.
He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
I've got to settle down.
It doesn't matter how, where, or with whom.
You've changed, Ellie.
I can't walk out on King now. It would make us all look so ridiculous.
Anyway, what difference does it make?
I'll never see Peter again.
Is that his name?
Peter Warne.
Peter Warne.
Why, do you know him?
Why, no.
Father, you haven't heard from him, have you?
- Don't be silly, of course.
- Please, what's that?
I guess that was his only interest in me, wasn't it?
- The reward.
- I'm sorry you read it.
- Are you going to see him?
- I suppose so.
Certainly. Pay him off. He's entitled to it.
He kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
Thank you, Mary. That's just what I needed.
Mr. Westley's on his way up.
Fine, have him come in.
I'll be going.
If it isn't the bridegroom himself. You're just in time, King.
How are you, Ellie?
You happy?
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy?
Here we are, let's drink.
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement.
We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment.
We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off.
- Promise you'll never let me get off.
- Whatever you say, darling. It's a promise.
Yeah. Who?
Why can't I see you at your office?
I'm leaving for Washington tonight. I may be gone several weeks.
I thought, perhaps, you'd like to get this thing settled.
But I don't like the idea of butting in on your jamboree.
Between you and me, those things give me a stiff pain.
You don't have to see anybody. You can come directly to my study. No.
Why do I wanna--
Hey, wait a minute. Maybe I will come over. Yeah.
I'd like to get a load of that three ring circus you're pulling.
I wanna see what love looks like when it's triumphant.
I haven't had a good laugh in a week.
Mr. Warne?
Yeah.
- Sit down.
- Thanks.
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
That's typical of your daughter.
Why did she think I lugged her from Miami?
She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
She does? Isn't that sweet of her? You don't, I suppose.
Well, I don't know. I'll have to see on what you base your claim.
I presume you feel justified.
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here. I got it all itemised.
"Cash outlay, $8.60. Top coat, $15.
"Suitcase, $7.50. Hat, $4.
"Three shirts, $4.50. Total, $39.60.
"All of the above items had to be sold to buy gasoline."
And I sold some shorts and socks, too. I'm throwing those in.
- Yes, I know.
- What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough?
Trip like that'd cost you a $1,000, maybe more.
Now, let me get this straight.
You want $39.60 in addition to the $10,000?
What 10,000?
The reward.
Who said anything about a reward?
I'm afraid I'm a little bit confused. I assumed--
All I want is $39.60.
If you give me a check for it, I'll get out of this joint.
It gives me the jitters.
- You're a peculiar chap.
- We'll go into that some other time.
The average man would go after the reward.
Did anybody ever make a sucker out of you?
It's a matter of principle. You probably wouldn't understand.
When anybody takes me for a buggy ride, I don't like paying for the privilege.
Were you taken for a buggy ride?
Yes. With all the trimmings. So how about the check, do I get it?
- Certainly.
- Thanks.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Do you mind if I ask you a question, frankly?
Do you love my daughter?
Any guy in love with your daughter should be examined.
Now that's an evasion.
She picked herself a perfect running mate, King Westley.
The pill of the century.
She needs a guy that'd sock her once a day whether it's coming to her or not.
If you were wiser, you'd have done it yourself long ago.
Do you love her?
A normal man couldn't live with her without going nutty.
She's my idea of nothing.
I asked you a simple question! Do you love her?
Yes! Now don't hold that against me! I'm a little screwy myself!
Here's to the merry-go-round.
Perfect. Now you look natural.
- I hope you got your money.
- You bet I did.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Same to you.
Stay around and watch the fun. You'll enjoy it immensely.
I would, but I've got a weak stomach.
- I just had a long talk with him.
- I'm not interested.
Now just a minute, Ellie.
I don't want to hear another word about him.
Come on, folks. King Westley has arrived.
Here they come, boys. Turn them over.
You're a sucker to go through with this.
That guy, Warne, is okay.
He didn't want the reward. All he asked for was $39.60.
It's what he spent on you. Said it was a matter of principle.
You took him for a ride.
He loves you, Ellie. He told me so.
You don't want to be married to a mug like Westley.
I can buy him off for a pot of gold.
And you can make an old man happy.
And you won't do so bad for yourself.
If you change your mind, your car's waiting at the back gate.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God and in the face of this company, to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony.
If any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak or else, hereafter forever, hold his peace.
King, will thou have this woman to thy wedded wife so long as you both shall live?
I will.
Ellen, will thou have this man to thy wedded husband so long as you both shall live?
Ellen!
Ellie!
What happened?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Don't want to talk to you. Don't want to talk to anybody.
Don't want to see anybody.
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Hello, my would be ex-son-in-law.
I've sent you a check for $100,000.
That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment.
That's satisfactory, isn't it? It ought to be.
I'm not complaining. Not complaining. It was dirt-cheap.
Don't fall out of any windows!
There's another wire from Peter. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
"What's holding up the annulment, you slowpoke.
"The walls of Jericho are toppling."
Send him a telegram right away. Just say, "Let them topple."
- Funny couple, ain't they?
- Yeah.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
They're married, all right. I just seen the license.
They made me get them a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
What do you reckon that's for?
Blamed if I know. I just brought them a trumpet.
A trumpet?
They sent me to the store to get it.
What in the world do they want a trumpet for?
Don't know.
How often do I have to tell you... that Sophia Frederica is no longer to play with toys.
She's almost seven now.
Don't smoke in here.
The child is sick.
I work day and night to arrange an advantageous marriage someday, and you undo everything.
How am I to make it clear to you that Sophia might one day become a queen?
I don't want to be a queen, Mother.
I want to be a toe dancer.
Be quiet, Sophia.
You're going to marry a king if I have anything to do with it.
Stick out your tongue, Your Highness, and say "ahh."
Not as bad as I thought.
We'll build her a nice harness, and she'll have to wear it for about a year.
Put those toys away.
I don't want to see them again!
You'll grow up to be a tall and beautiful woman.
I must be off on one of my operations.
Don't let them frighten you, darling.
"A nice harness"!
What is he, a horse doctor?
You flatter him.
Our learned medico is going to perform one of his operations with an axe.
- He's the public hangman.
- Hangman?
What's a hangman?
Can I become a hangman someday?
A hangman is an executioner, the man who takes heads off skilfully.
Sometimes that profession becomes the sport of titles.
I was about to read to you... of Peter the Great and Ivan the Terrible, and other Russian tsars and tsarinas who were hangmen.
Stop walking, August.
You make me nervous.
Your Highness, a letter from the king.
Your father wishes to see you at once.
Sit down, my child.
We have been honoured with a communication from His Majesty... which concerns you principally.
"We, by Divine Grace Frederick, king of Prussia,
"have, after a series of negotiations,
"decided to honour your family by selecting your daughter,
"Sophia Frederica to forthwith set out for Russia...
"and there to become the bride of His Serene Highness, Peter Feodorovich,
"grandson of Peter the Great, nephew of Her Imperial Majesty,
"and heir presumptive to the throne.
"Within the week, an emissary will arrive...
"to escort your daughter and her mother,
"Princess Johanna Elizabeth, to the court at Moscow.
" Please inform her that she is to follow dutifully...
"the advice of Her Majesty's ambassador...
"and extend to her, as well as to your entire family, my fond greetings and affections.
Fredericus Rex."
Grand duchess of Russia!
Not bad for this family.
I wonder what he looks like.
That unimportant detail can be settled when the ambassador gets here.
Come, August, we shall reply to the king at once.
One must strike while the iron's hot.
Come with me.
This is the countess Cecilia, a cousin on my mother's side.
and this is her sister, Maria, and this--
Your Highness may now come down.
This is Count Alexei, field marshal of the Russian Army, grand master of the hunt, lord of the chamber and ambassador extraordinary... from Her Divine Majesty, Elizabeth of Russia.
This is my daughter Sophia.
Although for a long time we've heard about your beauty, Your Highness,
I must confess, I was not quite prepared to see such a vision of loveliness.
Her Majesty instructed me to present a few gifts as evidence of her graciousness.
Come here.
This pipe is for you, Prince August.
These sables are to keep your shoulders warm.
These gloves are to keep your hands warm.
This robe is to keep your feet warm.
These hot-water bottles, to keep Mother warm.
Is it then still so cold in Russia, Your Excellency?
Indeed, Your Highness, the rivers are still frozen, and will be until some time after we've arrived.
Her Majesty also asked me to give you this token of her esteem.
Convey to her my profoundest thanks.
Isn't Her Majesty beautiful!
How long will the journey take?
If weather permits, we should reach Moscow in seven weeks, where Her Majesty is impatiently awaiting us.
- And when does Your Excellency require the journey be begun?
- The day after tomorrow, unless it is the desire of this charming young lady... to leave at once to meet her anxious bridegroom.
- Did you bring me a portrait of the grand duke?
- I'm sorry, I did not.
- Would you like him to be handsome?
- Isn't he?
Would you like him to be better looking than all men, tall and gracious?
- Yes, I think I would.
- Well, he is all that and more.
He's the handsomest man in the Russian court, tall and formed like a Greek god, a model in fashion and deportment which all of us strive to follow.
- Are you eager to see him?
- Yes.
His eyes are like the blue sky, his hair the colour of ebony.
He is stronger than a team of oxen, and sleepless because of his desire to receive you in his arms.
And he can also read and write.
So can my daughter.
She can cook and sew and make her own bed if she has to.
- Can't you, Sophia?
- But I don't like to make my own bed, Mother.
- Don't speak unless you're questioned.
- You did question me, Mother.
Say good night, and go back to your room and go to sleep.
This is unexpected.
Your daughter is extremely charming... and will be by far the most beautiful woman at Her Majesty's court.
I'd be grateful if you were not to turn her head.
She's been brought up carefully, is unspoilt, and I've taught her not to flirt.
You're going on a far journey, and I may never see you again.
Remember what I've taught you.
Always to be honest and truthful, to be a faithful wife and a loyal subject of your new country.
Be kind to those who are in your service... and obedient to your husband and superiors, and strive at all times to be worthy of your glorious destiny.
Another day like this, and I'll fall apart.
When I return, I'll complain to the king about the state of his roads.
The roads are bad, aren't they?
When we reach the border, there will be snow and we shall change to sleds.
Your rooms are ready, Your Royal Highness.
Can I show them to you?
Yes, you may.
I'm prepared for the worst.
Is the journey proving too much for you too?
It could go on forever... if Mother didn't mind.
Be careful with that knife.
You'll cut your beautiful hand.
Your hand is beautiful, isn't it?
- Why did you do that?
- Because I've fallen in love with you.
Now you may punish me for my effrontery.
I deserve punishment far more than you do.
We must never do this again.
It's disloyal to my future husband.
Disloyal?
It's treason, and I must be careful in the future, but you must help me by not exciting me with your beautiful eyes.
I told you not to look at me.
What are you two doing?
Don't answer me. I don't want to know.
Sophia, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
You will instantly follow me to our rooms.
Incidentally, our rooms are beneath all contempt, Your Excellency.
The stables are probably better than the quarters assigned to us.
I'm sorry, Your Highness.
If you prefer the stables,
I'm certain I can arrange to have the horses quartered in your bedroom.
Barbarian!
You're going to sleep in my room tonight.
It is cold.
At least you have something to warm you when you get to Moscow,
That is, if your husband isn't completely made of ice.
A basket of fruit with Her Majesty's compliments, and these flowers from the grand duke, who instructed me to ride day and night for a week to be here in time.
Welcome home, Your Excellency.
We've missed you.
So, this is little Sophie, Sophia Frederica.
Hardly a name for a future empress.
- You don't like your name, do you?
- I do, Your Majesty.
You will be called Catherine Alexina, a good Russian name.
We've arranged a special ceremony to receive you into our church.
- Haven't we, Simeon?
- Yes, little mother, we've arranged a ceremony.
Come here.
So, this is the mother.
You've raised a pretty child.
Your Majesty, I've come to lay at your feet feelings of the deepest gratitude... for the benefactions which your bounty has heaped upon our house, and of which many instances are given me at every step I take into your Majesty's realms.
Tush, tush!
A pretty speech.
What I have done is nothing in comparison with what I shall do.
- My own blood is no more dear to me than yours. - Is that the grand duke?
This is the order of St. Catherine.
May you both wear it in good health.
Be careful it doesn't scratch you.
Pin this on Catherine.
What do you think of Catherine?
I can only admire your judgment, Your Majesty.
That's the chancellor.
Steals more money in a week than I collect in taxes in a year.
Doctor, come here.
What do you think of my taste in women?
Looks healthy, doesn't she?
Just what we need to breed sons for Russia.
With your permission, Your Highness.
- How was the journey?
Comfortable?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Are you happy to be here?
Yes, Your Majesty.
- Are you going to love your new country?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Do you promise to be a loyal subject?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Don't make too many new friends, and no intrigue and gossip. I have my hands full now.
Perfect, Your Majesty.
She will give us no trouble.
Your Highness.
Someday I'll have every doctor thrown out of the country.
Catherine, before you go to your rooms, is there any wish I can grant you?
I would like to see the grand duke.
His Imperial Highness, Grand Duke Peter.
That's a fine way to receive your bride!
I suppose you had more important things to do.
I told you to be on time.
Go on, kiss each other.
Remember, Catherine, the first child must be a boy.
That's why we had you brought here,. to provide Russia with an heir to the throne.
A fine, bouncing, healthy heir.
You understand me, Catherine?
These are your ladies-in-waiting.
They represent illustrious houses of our most important domains.
Step forward, Natacha.
She is the daughter of Prince Dolgorukij.
Natacha, come here.
This is your mistress of the wardrobe.
She has charge of the beds and laces.
I must show her my new invention.
I'm in a hurry.
I must witness an execution.
I suggest that you wait in the next room.
Perhaps I shouldn't have lied to you.
Forgive me, won't you?
His Imperial Highness sent me for his soldiers.
I hope I haven't disturbed you.
That's Countess Varonsoff.
She's always picking up the grand duke's soldiers, which I'm beginning to suspect he leaves intentionally.
Don't bother.
Don't bother.
Go on with your work.
Doesn't Sophia, I mean, Catherine, look beautiful?
I always forget the new name.
Just see what's being done to her hair!
That's exactly what I'm looking at.
How's she going to wear the head-dress?
Where is the head-dress?
- Where is the head-dress?
- Where's the head-dress?
We must make you very beautiful, Catherine, very, very beautiful... so that my nephew will fall in love with you.
I expect you two to behave like love birds so Russia will have an heir to the throne.
Remember, I want a boy, not a girl.
Nothing less than a boy will do.
We don't want any more women on the throne.
But Your Majesty, what would we have done if you had been born a boy?
I would have had less trouble in Russia if I'd been born a man instead of woman.
We women are too much creatures of the heart, aren't we, Catherine?
Yes, Your Majesty.
"Grant them of the fruit of their bodies fair children,
"concord of soul and body.
"exalt them like the cedars of Lebanon.
"like a luxuriant vine, give them seed in number like full ears of grain...
"that they may abound in every work that is good and acceptable unto Thee;
"and let them behold their children's children like a newly planted olive orchard,
"round about their table that obtaining favour in Thy sight, they may shine like the stars of heaven."
Blessed be this bed.
Your Imperial Majesty, before the bridal pair retire, I wish to propose a toast... to Her Imperial Highness, the grand duchess Catherine.
May our new bride from far away be forever happy... and learn to know the love we have in our Russian hearts for her... and the hope this vast, imperishable empire has... for an heir to the throne.
You have made me very happy today, Catherine, and I hope you will continue to make me happy.
Now, I'm going to bed.
I'm very tired.
And I know that most of you... are--
are also very tired.
May I inquire how Her Imperial Highness deigns to feel this morning?
Her Highness feels as well as can be expected... after her romantic marriage.
And how is His Excellency?
His Excellency is distressed because you've been avoiding him for an eternity.
- I haven't been avoiding you.
- You have.
I've tried again and again to see you alone...
- and you've made it impossible.
- If you must know,
I haven't had enough time to recover from the shock... of finding my husband a trifle different than you described him.
I had a duty to my country and a loyalty to my sovereign.
Had I described the grand duke correctly, you might not have come here.
I would have obeyed my mother even if you had told the truth.
How could I have known of such a degree of filial respect?
Anyway, I would have taken no chances, because from the moment I saw you,
- I wanted you to come to Russia.
- Please, be careful.
- My husband will be told.
- Your husband doesn't mean a thing to you.
He does.
I'll always be faithful to him.
Those ideas are old-fashioned.
This is the eighteenth century.
But I'm not a Russian.
I'm going now.
I told you I wanted to see you alone.
I won't wait any longer.
I'll be at the stables tomorrow when you go for your ride.
Maybe I won't care to ride anymore.
- I'll be there, and you'd better be there too.
- I will not!
Furthermore, I'm going to tell my mother all about you.
One moment more, Your Imperial Highness.
On the reverse side of this miniature is a diamond.
Don't lose the diamond.
What are you doing here sneaking around like a ghost?
- I hate my wife.
- You hate your wife?
You've only been married for a week.
You'll make a fine emperor someday, you idiot!
You can't force a woman to be sweet to you.
She's only a child!
Be patient with her.
You know our people are waiting for you to raise a family.
- They don't care whether you like her.
- I don't want her.
I picked her for your wife, and your wife she will remain as long as I live.
Get that into your skull.
I don't want to hear any more about it.
Do you understand me?
Her Majesty is waiting for you in the council chamber.
- War with Finland?
- Yes, Your Excellency.
- How is Her Majesty?
- The last few days she's turned sour, like milk that's been standing too long.
Your Highness is so happy this morning.
- You can't be going to see your husband.
- Dear me, my husband!
I'd forgotten I have a husband.
No, I'm not going to see my husband.
If Your Highness were not so new to our court, I'd suspect you were going to see your lover.
Lover?
And what may a lover be?
A lover's a man, not a husband, who loves you with all his heart and whom you love in return.
But, Marie, that's wicked.
Don't tell me that you have a lover!
I wish I had.
Here, everyone has a lover, everyone but me.
Oh, Marie, not everyone.
Her Exalted Majesty can't possibly have a lover.
What about the young man who's always with her?
Why do you suppose she leans on him so heavily?
Because she's weak in the knees?
Oh, how shocking! If anyone should hear us!
Go on, get my dress.
Your highness won't tell anyone.
The empress is a devil when she's angry.
Of course I won't tell anyone, nor do I believe such nonsense.
Neither have I a lover. I'm happy because I'm going to see my mother.
- Your mother?
I thought you knew.
- Knew what?
Your mother left for Germany.
Her carriage set out at midnight.
- You must be joking.
- I'm not joking.
Her Majesty ordered her to return immediately.
But she didn't say good-bye.
That's not possible.
Her Majesty's in council.
No one's allowed to enter.
No order in this palace is intended for me.
Why did you send my mother away?
What wrong had she done?
I don't remember sending for you.
I want to know why you sent my mother away.
You presume to question me?
Who do you think you are, bursting into a conference as though the palace were on fire?
You want to know why I sent your mother away.
Well, I'll tell you why.
I sent your mother away because she didn't bring you up properly.
I was told you were an obedient, respectful child.
You're nothing of the sort!
Why do you think I had you brought from Germany?
To give you these pearls?
Or to make you a grand duchess of the Holy Russian Empire?
I had you brought here to be an obedient wife... and to supply my country with a much-needed heir to the throne.
Take Her Imperial Highness, the grand duchess, and turn her over to my mistress of the robes... with instructions that from this minute on she's to be attached to my personal staff... where I can keep her under my eye, where I can educate her and teach her... what it means to be a Russian wife and how to accept the embraces of a husband... like a Russian wife!
Now, get out, both of you.
I have a war on my hands.
Looking for someone?
Oh, you frightened me.
I've only a minute.
I ran away.
I came down to tell you not to wait.
I must go now.
Is that all you came to tell me?
What else is there to tell?
If you come closer, I'll scream.
It will be easier for you to scream without a straw in your mouth.
Get up!
Get up!
Why are there six places?
What's the occasion?
You asked me to arrange a dinner for the French and Austrian ambassadors and their wives.
Tell them to come for breakfast.
I never did like these diplomatic functions.
- They lead to nothing.
- I quite agree, Your Majesty.
Don't any of you think I'm going to eat with a lot of dried-up mummies every night.
Boris, sit down there.
Alexander, sit over there.
You, sit there.
Michael!
- Your Majesty.
- Catherine.
Take his toys.
Michael, sit there.
Paul!
- Your Majesty.
- Oh, go on.
Sit down.
Now, the rest of you get out.
Get out!
Get out!
- The pig, Your Majesty.
- Put it down and don't make so much fuss about it.
The way you handle that pig, you'd think it was the only one in Russia.
- The wine, Your Majesty.
- Fill the glasses and get out.
What are you pouting for?
You're not jealous of Paul, are you?
He isn't jealous of you.
You look exhausted, Paul.
What's the matter?
I'm tired.
My wife gave birth to a child yesterday.
- Boy or girl?
- A boy, beloved empress.
What the wife of a guard can do should certainly be easy for a grand duchess.
Remind me to give you a purse of gold tomorrow.
Those of you who have boys, raise your hands.
Exactly what I thought!
A few more like you, and Russia need never worry about her enemies.
What's this, Alexei?
Sending notes to the grand duchess?
Do you want me to send you into exile?
Or shall I tell the grand duchess that you're a notorious heartbreaker... and have broken every woman's heart in this court, including mine?
You're very flattering, Imperial Majesty, but the note contains nothing of importance.
Then suppose you read it.
"We are all very much disturbed over your conduct... and wish you would change your behaviour so that Her Majesty might forgive you."
Who else can read here?
You read it, Catherine.
I know you can read... because my reports say you foolishly spend your time in bed reading books!
"We are all very much upset at, uh, uh --
"at-- and hope...
you will behave better... so that you may be forgiven by the empress."
Send for the chancellor!
- Your Imperial Majesty?
- Read this for me.
"You must help me to see you alone again.
"You are being watched so closely that all my efforts to meet you... for a few precious seconds are in vain."
So, you're up to your old tricks again!
Right under my nose too.
Well, forget about her.
she's reserved for my nephew and being taught how to earn his love first... before wasting her favours on others.
Go back to your dinner.
It's the first time you've been of use to me in a year.
As for you, look after my friends and see that they're fed well.
Did you hear what I said?
Sit down, you fools, or I'll send you to Siberia.
She may be a grand duchess to the rest of the world, but in here she's being taught how to be a Russian wife!
Catherine, where are you?
Take off my boots!
Go outside and send the others away.
Everybody!
I want to be alone tonight.
Her Majesty wishes to be alone tonight.
You wouldn't think that once I had skin like velvet.
Empress, bah!
I haven't even the power to iron out a single wrinkle.
What are you looking at?
That must be Peter.
Go see if it is, and tell him to come here at once.
Your Imperial Highness, Her Majesty wishes to see you at once.
What the devil do you mean poking holes in my bedroom?
I wanted to watch my wife.
Watching your wife won't give you an heir to the throne.
The next time I catch you providing my rooms with needless ventilation,
I'll have you flogged.
I'll catch my death of a draft someday!
Go back to your rooms and wait for your wife.
This is your fault.
I had hoped by bringing you to Russia to make a man of that half-wit!
Sorry to intrude, Your Majesty.
I think the grand duke dropped one of his soldiers in here.
Thank you.
Good night.
Wait a minute.
Come here.
How long have you been at this court picking up soldiers?
Two years and a half, Your Majesty.
I fail to recall your exact duties here, Countess Elizabeth.
I'm in charge of entertainment for His Imperial Highness, the grand duke.
Exactly how far is it to your home, Lizzie?
My ancestral home is in the province of Astrakhan, about two weeks' journey from Moscow.
Not as far as I had hoped.
His Imperial Highness has been entertained long enough.
Do you understand me?
I don't want to see you around again.
Get out.
She won't snoop around here anymore.
I should have thrown her out before I had you brought here.
Come here, Catherine.
Sit down.
Haven't you given me trouble enough?
Are you going to behave like an obedient wife... or must I continue to treat you like a stubborn child?
I don't care what you do with me.
You might change your mind about that.
You're in love with His Excellency, Count Alexei, aren't you?
No, Your Majesty, I'm not.
I'm not.
It's a good thing you're not.
I wouldn't advise you to become my rival.
Rival?
What does Your Majesty mean?
You will find out soon.
In the meantime, you can blow out the candles.
Before you retire... you can be of one more service.
Behind my mirror, a concealed passage will lead you down... a flight of stairs to another door.
behind that door you will find someone waiting to come up.
I don't want him to see you, so be careful.
- Good night, Your Majesty.
- Good night, Catherine.
And you don't need to report for duty until late tomorrow.
Halt!
Who goes there?
- Nobody.
- Just a minute, my little hen.
That's not the password.
You'd better think up another one.
Come to the guardhouse, and we'll find out who you are.
You're entirely too good-looking to be running around like this.
What are you hiding back there?
Take your hands off me, you insolent fool!
I'm Catherine, grand duchess of Russia.
Don't take advantage of me.
This is my first night on duty.
The grand duchess isn't permitted out at night.
Tell me who you are.
I told you who I am.
Oh, come now.
Stop joking.
If you're the grand duchess, then I'm the grand duke.
I wish you were!
if I were the grand duke and you were the grand duchess,
I wouldn't let you prowl through the night like this, like a pretty little kitten.
Suppose I didn't want to tell you who I really am. What would happen?
On a night like this, anything might happen... if I'm fortunate.
Well, Lieutenant, you are fortunate, very... fortunate.
It's ringing!
Three volleys.
It's a boy!
Have you noticed, Your Majesty, how the imperial duckling resembles his father?
Hush, hush, enough of this.
Now, you keep an eye on him.
I don't want anyone near him unless I know about it, not even his mother.
I had enough trouble getting him.
If he catches cold or sniffles just once,
I'll have you hung by the ears!
If he coughs, I'll have you cut in half!
And if anyone touches him, I'll have you shot!
Your Majesty, I beg of you not to become excited.
You've been ill for weeks.
This turmoil will weaken you.
Don't any of you think I'll give you the pleasure of seeing me die!
I'll outlive all of you, you sinister buzzards.
All of you!
- We've been glad with rejoicing. - Your Imperial Highness!
I suppose you, too, want to congratulate me... as the father of the heir to the throne of Russia.
That was my intention, Your Imperial Highness.
And I bring you the felicitations of my nation... and my own personal congratulations on so glorious an event.
Yes, I know.
Tell me about it some other time.
I want to be alone, do you hear?
Get out, all of you!
I'm crammed up to my neck with congratulations!
Get out!
And if you must congratulate someone, congratulate my wife!
May I speak with Her Highness?
The empress joins her people in congratulating Your Highness... on the birth of a male heir to the throne of Russia.
We all hope you will recover quickly... so you may wear this jewel, which Her Majesty is pleased to present to you as a sign... of her most extraordinary joy and satisfaction.
Sit down, ladies. Sit down.
Your Excellency, what can I do for you?
Will you please ask Her Highness once more...
- if she will grant me an audience?
- I'm sorry, Your Excellency, we have orders from Her Highness not even to mention your name to her.
Then perhaps you will convey to Her Highness... that I've been waiting for some time now to congratulate her... on the great historic event of providing our country with a much-needed heir to the throne.
I'm certain that history was far from her mind at the time, Your Excellency.
Her Majesty is very ill, and her days are numbered.
Soon she will be no more, poor soul, and another maniac will become our emperor.
It will be a bad day for Russia, and for me if I live that long.
Why are you telling this to me?
You know that the grand duke isn't exactly pleased with the present state of affairs.
State of affairs?
What affairs?
I haven't had an affair for some time.
I know that the grand duke plans to remove you from court... or worse, as soon as he is in power.
You need have no fear for me.
Now that I've learned how Russia expects me to behave,
I like it here.
And I intend to stay... grand duke or no grand duke!
We all hope you will stay, and I for one, at the risk of my neck, would like to help you.
How could you be of help?
I control enough of the political machine to carry some weight in a crisis.
I have no wish to share in any petty conspiracy.
Should it become unavoidable, I think I have weapons... that are far more powerful than any political machine.
I'm afraid you don't know Russians, my child.
That's possible, father, But I'm taking lessons as fast as I can.
Right here, gentlemen.
What a lovely target.
You're looking quite well, Catherine, since you provided me with an unexpected addition to the family.
Thank you, Peter. It's nice to see you again.
Come to think of it, I'd like you to meet someone... who's come for an extended visit.
What are you doing here?
Back to the barracks!
Get out!
Come along, Catherine.
What do you think of this decapitation?
It would be more amusing if it were real.
Where's your visitor?
Oh, it's Lizzie.
Is she in charge of your entertainment again? What will Her Majesty say?
Her Majesty doesn't know anything about it, and I wouldn't advise you to tell her.
I wouldn't dream of telling the empress.
She has her own system of spies.
Not for the world would I interfere with your pleasures, as long as you don't interfere with mine.
How is Astrakhan, Lizzie? Or was it Afghanistan?
If you're wise, you'll find out for yourself before it's too late!
There are comfortable convents along the way.
All you have to do to gain admission... is shave your head.
It's good for the scalp, anyway!
Entirely too many men love my hair, and I have no intention of changing my residence.
- Anyway, this country will soon need a new empress.
- You may as well know...
Peter's going to marry me when the old bat dies... and as soon as he gets rid of his present wife!
There you are, you old crow.
Dead as a doornail at last.
What have you got to say about it?
Open your mouth if you can.
In another week, it'll be full of ice.
In another month, not a soul will mourn for you.
In another year, you'll be forgotten.
Where is all your power?
It's mine now!
Do you hear me?
Take it away from me if you can!
It's my turn now!
- Who is this officer?
- Orloff, Your Majesty,
Captain in charge of the barracks.
Your Majesty, your visit here is the greatest honour in my life.
I've heard a good deal about you, Captain, from the ladies.
I didn't expect to see you here, Your Excellency.
Why not, Your Majesty?
This is my pet regiment.
You look ravishing.
Now, there's another good-looking soldier.
Come here, Lieutenant.
What's your name?
Dmitri, Your Majesty.
And your duties, Dmitri?
In charge of the night watch, Your Majesty.
It must be cold at night...
sometimes.
Sometimes, Your Majesty.
Anyway, I'm certain you're very efficient, Lieutenant.
Is he, Captain?
Tell me something about him.
He's very efficient, Your Majesty.
He joined our regiment from the Swedish front, where he fought bravely for about two years.
He's also distinguished himself by exemplary bravery on the Turkish border.
This should have been brought to our attention.
I can't understand why such a brave man hasn't been decorated.
His Excellency doesn't mind.
Not if Her Majesty will tell me why she continues to avoid me.
Her Majesty will tell you tonight...
if you will call on her.
With pleasure, Your Majesty.
For bravery in action.
See that you do justice to it in future emergencies.
And now, Captain, tell me something about yourself.
Your Majesty, I'm distressed at my neglect at not having rewarded Lt. Dmitri before.
With your permission, Your Majesty.
Rich too?
Her Majesty will see you now, Your Excellency.
At last, Your Majesty, I've achieved... the enviable privilege of entering these rooms.
I seem to have a faint recollection that you had that privilege before.
Not since the days of Her Late Majesty, whom I often visited in the capacity of a trusted advisor.
Tell the others I've retired.
Send them away, and come back in here.
Her Majesty wishes to be alone tonight.
You may retire.
Tell me, Alexei, are you still fond of me?
Yes, Your Majesty, I love you.
But I'm completely bewildered by your attitude towards me.
However, I've become accustomed to regard you... as one of those extraordinary women... who create their own laws and logic.
and now I'm concerned only with your safety.
Is it my safety that concerns you... or the safety of an empress?
I would give my life if the woman I adore were not so far removed from me in station.
The woman you adore is quite close to you, isn't she?
Catherine, I love you, worship you.
I asked you here tonight because I want you to do something for me.
I can trust you, can't I?
We'll always be friends, won't we?
Yes, Your Majesty.
What is it you require?
Blow out the candles.
Behind the mirror, as you know, there's a flight of stairs.
Down below, someone is waiting to come up.
Will His Excellency be kind enough to open the door for him carefully... so that he can sneak in?
Her Majesty is waiting for you, Captain.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Will you deliver a message for me, Captain?
I would be very glad to, sir.
Tell Her Majesty that I quite understand now.
No, never mind.
Don't tell her anything.
- She'll know.
- Yes, sir.
Something for the poor, Your Majesty?
For the poor, Captain?
Excellency?
Quite a haul tonight, father.
Chancellor?
Elizabeth?
Your Imperial Majesty, something for the poor?
That was for me.
Now what have you got for the poor?
There are no poor in Russia!
Get out!
I've had enough of this sanctimonious talk.
Let us drink.
Why doesn't he take up his collections in church?
To the most charming woman in my empire, my friend, the countess Elizabeth.
Go ask Her Majesty, my wife, why she doesn't join our toast.
His Majesty, the emperor of Russia, wishes me to ask... why Her Majesty refuses to join the toast.
Tell His Majesty that my thirst is not as great as his tonight.
Her Majesty wishes me to convey that her thirst is not as great as his tonight.
Go tell my wife she's a fool.
His Majesty wishes me to inform Her Majesty... that she is a fool.
What is your rank, Orloff?
Captain, Your Majesty.
Well, you're nothing now.
Now get out, both of you, and stay out!
Sit down!
My wife is not to leave the palace.
She's under arrest until further orders.
Am I the emperor of Russia, or am I not?
We'll issue a proclamation that she died... and ask the people to pray for her.
Hurry, Your Majesty.
Everything is ready.
What are you doing here?
Exit Peter III.
Enter Catherine II.
We, soldiers in the service of the Holy Russian Empire, do hereby solemnly swear to acknowledge... and to defend with our lives, the authority of Catherine our empress, and to destroy her enemies!
Your Majesty, we're sorry to trouble you,
But Her Majesty isn't in here, is she?
She's no longer in her rooms.
You infernal blockhead!
This is the last place in the world she would come to.
Double the guard!
Surround the palace!
Find her and bring her here to me!
God grant you victory, Catherine.
All Russia is waiting for the sound of our bell.
Why are those bells ringing?
Why are those bells ringing?
I don't know, Peter.
How dare you address me like that!
Who are you?
My name is Orloff, and I'm on duty as guard.
I'll have your head for this insolence!
You're addressing the emperor!
There is no emperor.
there is only an empress.
Old guard, present arms!
New guard...
Halt!
New guard...
Left...
Turn!
New guard...
Slow... march!
New guard... halt!
New guard... present... arms!
Old guard... shoulder... arms!
New guard... shoulder... arms!
Old guard... order... arms!
New guard... stand at...
Ease!
Look!
The Prince!
Fine body of men, the guards...
And no soldier in the world like them.
By gad, you're right, sir!
Beer and beef, that's the stuff that makes soldiers.
Besides, it gives a man... a figure
Have you seen today's "Times" sir?
No William.
- The news from Paris.
- Yes.
Over 50 people guillotined in one day.
Damnable, useless cruelty.
Well, what can you expect from foreigners with no sporting instinct?
Gad, if it wasn't for our fox hunting and our pheasant shooting...
I dare say we should be cruel too.
Let's hope the scarlet Pimpernel will save some of the rest.
- Do you know who he is, sir?
- No.
But I confess, I feel a little prouder...
When I remember that he is an Englishman.
Did you read this, sir?
He'll have his work cut out in Paris.
There they go again. It's always the same.
The drums roll, the knife falls...
And another aristocrat parts company with his head.
Very monotonous.
And so clumsy, that great ugly machine.
When all they need is a sharper razor.
A quick wrist and flick!
Here, steady!
Ho-ho, you're all right, partner.
I wish they'd give me a few aristocrats to shave.
Eh, Jacques?
Then we should see some sport.
And you would!
When you see me dealing with the Scarlet Pimpernel.
- The what?
- The Scarlet Pimpernel!
Haven't you heard?
There's a band of Englishmen helping these cursed aristos out of the country.
Their chief is the only man who ever cheated Madame Guillotine.
He's known by the title of the Scarlet Pimpernel.
Who is he?
Oh... that's the mystery.
So you're a farmer from Nordesque, are you?
Yes, sir.
You thought you could fool me with a disguise like that!
Well, I'll keep this wig of yours...
Because after tomorrow you won't have a head to put it on!
And I shall be delighted to visit Madame Guillotine...
And make the acquaintance of the only decent person left in France.
Captain, I say "Death to the Republic... and long live the King!"
Take him away!
Stupid fool!
That makes the third aristocrat I've caught this week.
I can smell 'em through any disguise.
Thank heaven for the game of chess.
It enables us to forget the more disagreeable realities of life.
I'm not so sure it is a good thing.
We've been too detached from reality all our lives.
That's what caused the revolution.
- Possibly.
- Undoubtedly!
If we'd only had eyes to see our own follies, we shouldn't be here now...
Waiting to be shaved...
By the national razor.
Which is the Count de Tournay?
I am the Count de Tournay's daughter.
My father is over there playing the chess.
This is my mother.
The Count de Tournay?
If you will look at the passage I have marked...
Your spirits will be uplifted.
We are not afraid to die, Father.
Even so, it is sometimes better to live.
- How many, Captain?
- Sixty-four.
Robespierre gives Madame Guillotine extra fodder today.
The former Duc de Tours.
The former Abbé de Saint Preux.
The former Count and Countess de Larnai.
The former Madame de Nijon.
The former Count d'Eterais.
The former Marquis de Jouvence and family.
The former Marquis de Robeaupier.
The two Countesses Herret.
The former Mademoiselle de Bournard.
The two former Duchesses Passy and Boniveaux.
The former Marquis de Marais.
The former Count de Tournay and family.
The former Countess de Cherainville.
The former Madame de Piccard.
Come.
The former Count d'Arblai.
- Are you de Tournay?
- I am.
You are remanded. Citizen Robespierre wants to see you.
- Thank God!
- The rest of you, get on!
Take him inside!
Come on!
Come on!
Get out of the way!
Get out!
You must have courage, Suzanne.
Remember...
The Scarlet Pimpernel is waiting to save us.
He's never failed to keep his promise.
But it's too late!
Long live the King of France!
Long live the King of France!
Look at me whip, me hearties.
Look at it!
Three and twenty locks of hair in it.
There they are...
There's...
There's the Duc de Rouilly.
There's his handsome wife, the Duchess.
And here's the hair of her lover...
- The handsome...
- Where's your passport, hag?
He takes me for an aristocrat.
Well, you're right, Captain.
Can't be too careful, can you?
No, you can't be too...
Here, here's me passport.
This says "Citizeness Renard and grandson."
Where's the grandson?
He's in the cart, poor darling.
Yes?
What's the matter with him?
He's got the plague.
- The horrible black plague.
- Plague?
Yes.
I don't think I shall get him alive as far as Chambois.
Give me... give me a light from your pipe, will you Captain?
Keep away from me with your plague!
Get out of here, quick!
And when you come back, try to pass another gate.
For you won't pass through this one again!
You are right, Captain. You are right.
But I'll be back... somehow.
- Who's in charge here?
- I am.
An old hag of a woman will pass this way in a cart.
You are to stop her, and arrest her.
Did you say an old hag?
You heard me.
But, but she passed through here some time ago.
- Her passport was...
- You miserable fool!
You blundering idiot!
Did you search the cart?
No, no, I... her grandson was inside with the plague.
- Would you expect me to expose...
- You were expected to use your brains!
Now I see you haven't any!
That sick grandson was really three aristocrats snatched from the guillotine!
Ten thousand hells!
And the old hag, who was she?
The old hag, my clever Captain...
Was that cursed Englishman, the Scarlet Pimpernel.
- Forward, we'll catch him this time!
- Open the gates!
What's that?
What?
Sounds like a troop of horsemen.
We're being pursued!
Don't be frightened, Ladies. You are among friends.
- But this soldiers?
- My friends, Mademoiselle, and yours.
Are you the Scarlet Pimpernel?
I am only a humble instrument in the hands of our great leader.
- How many are you?
- Twenty, madam.
One to command, nineteen to obey.
- Shall we see your leader?
- I'm sorry, I must ask you to hurry.
- Where's de Tournay?
- Taken back into prison.
- Why?
- We don't know.
So we have to come back and take him.
- How are things at Calais?
- Lawson's there.
- And Ashurst?
- He hadn't arrived when we left.
Oh hadn't he?
His time sense is defective... that's twice.
They may have arrested him.
They're very careful at the Channel ports nowadays.
My order to you is that you're not to be arrested.
And I expect my orders to be obeyed.
Yes Percy.
You, Wilmot and Grant go back to Paris.
My brother-in-law will follow you there.
All three of you will get your next instructions from Quentin.
Well, goodbye.
And remember...
don't get caught.
- Right.
- Right.
- Good luck!
- Goodbye.
Go!
Giddap!
Well...
Why did they keep de Tournay back?
Because Robespierre wanted to see him.
And Robespierre wants to see him because the Ambassador of the Republic, has come over from London.
Chauvelin?
Why?
All in your honor, Percy.
Your work is becoming even more dangerous than it was.
Our work, Armand.
You go back to Paris at once.
Find out everything you can about Chauvelin
If he goes to London, you go too.
Our most dangerous enemy...
Is citizen Chauvelin.
Citizen Chauvelin.
My dear Chauvelin, I'm very sorry that I have to ask you to undertake the journey to London.
But this matter of the Scarlet Pimpernel has become a national menace.
How can you expect me to detect him in a country that hates us like the devil and puts every obstacle in my way?
We expect you to overcome obstacles like our generals in the field.
They know that to lose the battle means the guillotine.
Have you any plans?
Naturally.
We may assume that the Scarlet Pimpernel and his gang... speaks perfect French.
They belong therefore to a class that has been brought up by French nurses and French tutors.
So far not bad.
I have a list of all the likely names.
I have them watched day and night.
Sooner or later, I'll draw the net.
You think de Tournay might be useful?
Possibly.
De Tournay,
the former Count de Tournay
Former Ambassador to the former King of France in London.
Citizen Chauvelin
Ambassador of the French Republic in London.
De Tournay, I want to make you an offer.
We offer you your life.
All we ask in return... is that you merely get in touch with your many English friends... and soon you will be able to tell us who is the man known as the Scarlet Pimpernel.
You want me to be a spy?
You have been too long in politics not to be a realist.
A little piece of information... we give you your life.
God gave me my life...
He will take it away as soon as it pleases Him.
And now my family has gone to the guillotine...
My one wish is to follow.
Would it alter your outlook to hear that your family is alive?
Don't trifle with me.
I sent them to the guillotine for the future happiness of the human race...
But I do not allow torture.
Where are they?
I saw them being dragged towards the tumbrel.
On their way to the guillotine the band of the Scarlet Pimpernel snatched them away.
Where are they?
Probably in England by this time.
To His Majesty King George III.
God bless him for his hospitality to us poor exiles.
To King Louis of France...
May God protect him.
And to your husband, madam.
I hope the Scarlet Pimpernel and you gentlemen will rescue him, as you did us.
The Scarlet Pimpernel...
What a droll name...
What does it mean?
It is a humble wayside flower, mademoiselle.
And it hides the identity of the best and bravest man in all the world.
Do you know, Sir Andrew, my best friend in London
Marguerite St. Just?
Suzanne, how often am I to tell you
I will not have that woman's name mentioned in my presence.
But mother, you can't believe that dreadful story.
- What story?
- It's the truth.
Marguerite St. Just...
Denounced the Marquis de St. Cyr and his family to the tribunal.
They all went to the guillotine.
- Marguerite St. Just?
- Yes.
She married an Englishman.
Do you know her?
Know her?
Everybody in London knows Lady Blakeney.
Lady Blakeney, have you something in your mouth?
Not now, Mr. Romney.
I can't do justice to that lovely face when it's all bulged out with bonbon.
You may talk if you like, but no bonbon!
And no gestures, please!
All right, Mr. Romney.
I'll tell you what it is about the Pimpernel that tantalizes me so.
It is his insufferable modesty.
There's no excuse for it!
It's maddening to think that somewhere there's a man as marvelous as that.
And we never see him!
He is of no use to us whatever!
Lady Blakeney, I said no gestures, please!
Oh, you must remember that I am a French woman... and when I talk I must use these as well as this.
The de Tournay family arrived in Dover today.
All except the father.
We have to go back for him.
It's going to be devilish awkward after what's happened.
Well I'll go. So will Hastings if you'll let us.
We will all go if it comes to that.
But even so, we're only 20.
Yesterday, 30 people went to the guillotine.
Are you trying to suggest that there aren't enough of us?
Perhaps that there isn't a decent Englishman that wouldn't be proud to join us.
We could be 500, a thousand within a week.
And within another week everyone of us would be a marked man.
We shouldn't be able to rescue a single soul.
Mere force is useless against people who are neither cowards nor fools.
We must match courage with courage... and cunning with still greater cunning if we're going to do anything at all.
We are all willing to give our lives.
But we must do more than that.
We must mask our identities...
Suffer the humiliation of being taken for fops, fools, nitwits... cowards
So many people die every day that could be saved.
You think I don't feel that?
You think I like sitting there in the shadow of the knife... while one head falls after another?
People I know and love.
Innocent people...
kindly people...
Herded like sheep... butchered like cattle... by men who make high-sounding principles and excuses for the most bestial cruelty.
Robespierre's liberty, his equality...
Well... sink me, if it isn't Colonel Ramsbottom.
Well. how are you Ramsbottom?
Winterbottom, Sir!
Ramsbottom...
what a ridiculous mistake...
Allow me to explain, Colonel...
Here's that ass, Blakeney!
I'm off!
Odd's blood, this club wants cheering up.
Sink me, the place is a mausoleum.
Are you being offensive, Sir?
Who Sir?
Me, sir?
No, sir!
Stab me. I'm bubbling over with good humor this morning.
Would you believe me, I've just written a masterpiece?
- Who, sir?
You, sir?
- Me, sir!
- No, sir!
- Yes, sir!
All about this mysterious Pimpernel fellow.
How it came to me, heaven only knows because it was the busiest moment of the day...
Darn, I was tying my cravat.
Oh well, here it is.
"The Scarlet Pimpernel"
by Sir Percival Blakeney, Baronet.
- What?
- Well, that's the title.
"They seek him here,
"they seek him there.
"Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.
"Is he in heaven?
"Is he in hell?
That damned, elusive Pimpernel."
What?
Hmm, not bad!
Not bad?
It's damned good!
I'll write it out, then you can all learn it.
Yes...
Well...
Good day, gentlemen.
Goodbye. Higgenbottom.
Winterbottom, curse you!
I beg your pardon?
Didn't I say Winterbottom?
Bunch of young jackanapes!
They're all alike, this fashionable puppies.
Insufferable!
What that young man needs...
Is a year or two of hard campaigning.
Facing powder... and shot... undergoing privation.
I can't imagine Blakeney running into much danger.
Not he!
He doesn't belong to our vintage.
It's not my fault!
It's a matter of infinitely small importance to me... whose fault it is.
The man who could put starch in my jabot...
Is equally capable of putting poison in my coffee.
There, you see?
I'm a laughingstock, and rightly so.
Look at the cursed thing.
Sticking out like a barber's pole.
Sink me, the thing is a disaster.
Go away, Brinker, you dreadful fellow.
Ladies...
Your servant.
Marguerite... your slave.
Ah, Romney.
How are you?
And how is the portrait progressing?
The eyes are wrong, aren't they?
And is the nose all right?
You know...
I rather think you missed the mouth... altogether.
Yes, you have.
Otherwise, it's the image of her.
I think that will be enough for today.
Poor Mr. Romney.
You are tired, and so am I.
Tired?
Zounds, me too.
You know, dear lady...
I've just been to Bath to be cured of the fatigue.
And now I'm so fatigued by the cure that I...
I really think that I shall have to go to Bath again... to be cured of the fatigue.
It has been a charming party.
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye!
Bye, Lady Blakeney, thank you.
Bye, Sir Percy...
Goodbye, Sir Percy...
Goodbye, Sir Percy!
Goodbye, Goodbye...
Goodbye...
What do you think of it?
It's clever...
But there's something lacking.
What?
I don't know.
There's a look...
A look in the eyes...
He's lost it.
Perhaps, I've lost it.
Perhaps it was happiness.
Good gad, my dear!
How you could be unhappy. I can't imagine.
Can't you?
Percy...
Can't you?
Oh, cursed if I can.
Why, you're the most courted woman in town.
- By whom?
- By everybody.
Except you!
Dear me, my dear, I'm your husband.
Months after we were married, we were still happy...
And then came this...
Estrangement.
Which Heaven knows, is none of my making.
Can you honestly say that?
Can you honestly deny that you've changed?
So changed...
That I scarcely know you.
You're never with me now.
You're always away on some pretext or other.
I'm always alone.
Then I've mighty good news for you, my dear.
Your brother's arriving from Paris.
- Armand?
- Yes.
When?
At any moment.
And then you won't be alone, will you?
When am I going to see you again?
Whenever you wish to.
Well then, every day.
Suzanne!
Where's the chief?
He went to town yesterday as soon as he arrived here.
- Any order for us?
- Yes...
We have to wait here till tonight for a message from Armand St. Just.
Right.
- Did you follow them?
- Yes.
A sailor gave a letter to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes.
Did you get it?
It wasn't easy, but...
We had six men there.
Where are they now?
Gagged and bound on the ship.
And the letter?
You will release them tomorrow.
Watch every move they make.
Maurier...
Go over to France at once.
The moment St. Just returns, arrest him.
Armand St. Just.
Marguerite St. Just...
The famous actress...
She will give a great performance by Republican command...
For her brother's sake.
Percy, I don't want Armand to go back to France.
If you'll help me we can keep him in England.
He'll settle down here, marry a nice girl...
And have lovely children.
What a dreadful prospect.
What has poor Armand done to be sentenced to matrimony?
You should know better, my dear.
You're unhappy...
Armand, I have the satisfaction of knowing that the biggest fool in England has the most complete contempt for his wife.
Percy?
How did it happen?
I don't know.
I only know that when I married him he was a man.
He was my lover.
I was glad to give up everything for him.
And now...
You mustn't leave me, Armand!
I need you...
I'm all alone.
I can't stay.
You're going back to France?
But it's not safe!
For me?
I'm no aristocrat.
For anyone under the terror.
I shall look after the Blakeney estate in France.
Oh, Percy is so rich!
What does it mean to him?
He is not even interested in his English estates.
Since the terror he wouldn't go over to France for all the treasures in the world.
Why should you risk your life for his money?
Oh, I don't risk my life.
Don't worry, darling.
Percy?
May I ask you something?
What's happened to you and Marguerite?
Marriage, I suppose.
Why?
You loved her once...
I know.
Do you remember the first family to go to the guillotine?
The St. Cyrs.
They told me it was Marguerite who denounced them.
It was a lie!
I wish I could believe that.
Did you ask her?
I did.
She flashed back a "yes"
as sharp as the knife of the guillotine.
I watched that execution.
The Marquis...
His wife...
His son.
And it was my wife...
Who put them there.
So that's why you ceased to love her.
What a tragedy.
Ceased?
I shall love her till I die.
That's the tragedy.
And it's to make up what she did to them...
That you risk your own life week after week to rescue the others?
Don't be so heroic, Armand.
I got a smack in the eye, and I took refuge in sport.
And what a sport!
By gad,
I think I shall give up fox hunting this winter.
Now, what do you think of it?
Monstrous fine, sir!
Vastly becoming.
Now, there's a coat you could wear with comfort.
You know perfectly well I can wear nothing with comfort...
Until Sir Percy says so.
Where is that jackanapes?
Who. sir?
You, sir!
Here, sir!
And now, tell Treadle what...
What's wrong with this coat.
The back is admirable.
The front's fair.
The collar is. uh, possible.
But the sleeve. Treadle.
The cuff, my poor, benighted friend...
That, Sir Percy, is the last words in cuffs!
Oh, gad, I should hope so for there should never be another like it!
Oh, come now, it's...
It's not too bad.
You see, Sir Percy, His Royal Highness approves.
My poor Treadle, His Royal Highness does nothing of the kind.
He says it's "not so bad".
And nothing in the world is "so bad"...
As something which is "not so bad".
- But Sir Percy...
- It's a crime, Treadle.
Worse, a blunder.
And quite, quite fatal to my reputation.
Why to your reputation?
Because all the world knows that His Royal Highness is guided by my taste.
Yes, yes, yes...
Percy is an expert on coats.
And britches, sir!
I'm a very wonder with the inexpressibles.
Isn't that so, Treadle?
Well, yes, up to a point.
Zounds, Treadle...
Why must you be so cursed jealous?
Look at that puny sleeve...
That miserable dishrag of lace.
Odd's fish!
Looks like the lining hanging down.
It was only intended for a plain cut.
Plain!
it's as ugly as a parson's widow.
Open up your sleeves, man.
Let your ruffles take the air.
Let them flow, let them ripple.
So that when His Royal Highness takes snuff...
It'll be a swallows flight.
That's it!
Why, Timmy Percy...
You're brainless, spineless, useless
But you do know clothes.
Odd's fish!
That...
That's something, isn't it, sir?
- Treadle! Treadle!
Yes, Your Highness!
Don't forget what Sir Percy says about about the sleeves.
- A swallow's flight!
- Yes, Your Highness!
Flight of, uh, a swallow.
Come along, come along, gentlemen.
Oh, by the way, Wilmot...
Chauvelin's arrived in London.
Have him watched.
I'm just off to the fight with the Prince.
- Report to me there.
- Very good.
Mendoza's groggy!
He...
He's done!
Don't you believe it, sir. He's foxing!
You wait until the 30th round.
I'll wager 100 guineas he won't last two more rounds.
- Done!
- Come on, Mendoza!
Come on Jackson!
- You'd better hedge, Percy!
- Hedge be damned, I'll double.
- Done!
- Percy must be mad!
Mendoza's finished!
Get up, Mendoza!
Where is he?
- Where is he?
- He's at you house.
No, I will not!
You tricked me once into giving you information about the Marquis de St. Cyr.
I shall never forgive myself.
I'm sick of this sentimental twaddle about the poor persecuted aristocrats.
Have you forgotten what they did to the defenseless peasantry for centuries?
What this very St. Cyr did to you?
No, I have not.
But I'm no spy.
- That is your last word?
- Absolutely!
I wonder....
Oh, by the way, how's your brother, Armand?
Very well, I hope.
I hope so too.
But yesterday he was arrested...
Arrested?
At Boulogne.
What for?
As a traitor to his country.
Traitor?
You're lying, Chauvelin.
You're trying to trick me again.
I've the proof of his guilt in my pocket.
This scrap of paper will certainly send your brother to the guillotine.
Unless, of course, you care to redeem it.
Bring me the name of the Pimpernel and it is yours.
But even if I wanted to...
- I don't know it!
- Find it!
How can I if you can't with an army of spies?
Because you go everywhere and know everyone in his circle.
That much I do know.
And this also...
That he will be among the guests tomorrow night at the Grenville ball.
So will half the world!
This thing is impossible!
You're a clever woman whose brother's life is at stake...
Nothing is impossible.
Well?
No, Chauvelin...
I won't!
Very well, madam.
Chauvelin!
Madam?
Do you swear to give me that paper?
The moment I catch the Scarlet Pimpernel.
Zounds!
That name again?
I've heard nothing else all day.
At the club. the fight, and now here.
I protest, the fellow is a public nuisance.
I beg your pardon, my dear.
Do I intrude?
No, no.
This is an old, uh, acquaintance.
Monsieur Chauvelin, the French Ambassador.
My husband.
Charmed, delighted, enchanted.
Devilish clever race, the French.
How they speak that unspeakable language of theirs defeats me.
You flatter us, Sir Percy.
No, no, you've got the cleverest heads in the world.
The only trouble is...
You all go to pieces around the neck.
Around the neck?
Yes, now look at that thing.
Sink me, what a mess!
Now, if you'd really like to know how to tie a cravat...
I'll tell you.
But it isn't easy, mind, it would take all my brains.
I'm sure it would.
Yes, now look here.
Well, you see, first of all the thing goes twice around the neck.
And then the front folds back to allow the back to come to the front.
Otherwise the front would be all behind as well as before.
Percy, what are you talking about?
You don't follow me, my dear?
That's exactly what I say.
It takes brains, doesn't it?
- One can see that.
- Yes, of course.
Good day, Lady Blakeney.
Oh, no, no, don't go.
You and my wife must have so much to say to each other.
We have.
But then I promised myself a little tête-á-tête with Lady Blakeney at Lord Grenville's ball tomorrow night.
Good.
Tomorrow night, then.
But before you go...
You must hear my verse about that cursed Pimpernel fellow.
You'll love it!
Listen.
"They seek him here...
"they seek him there...
"Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.
"Is he in heaven?
"Is he in hell?
That damned elusive Pimpernel".
- Delightful!
- What? Especially that, uh...
that line:
"Those Frenchies seek him everywhere".
Yes, I like that too.
Because, you see
I hear that they do.
And that gives the line a sort of something...
That sort of gives it, ah...
A something, uh...
If I make myself clear.
Clear as crystal.
Good day, my dear Sir Percy.
Bonjour, "misu", as the French say.
Bonjour!
Magnificent fight this afternoon, my dear.
Gad, that fellow Mendoza's got quick ears.
In the 10th round, when Jackson had him down
I shouted, "Get up Mendoza!"
And damn me, he did.
And, sink me, he won.
Do you think...
Andrew Ffoulkes might be the Scarlet Pimpernel?
Andrew?
Never!
He couldn't hit a ball at Eaton!
Why?
What's your interest in the Scarlet Pimpernel?
No more than any other woman's.
We would all like to know who he is.
So would your friend Chauvelin, I'll wager.
What makes you say that?
Isn't that what he is here for?
Did he tell you?
- Why should he?
- Why not?
Mind you, the man is clever...
But a fellow who can't even tie his own cravat...
Isn't likely to put a noose 'round the Pimpernel's neck is he?
Really, Percy.
Can you never rise above trivialities?
Can't rise above anything with more than three syllables, my dear, I never could.
Nonsense!
You were a man once!
A man a woman could look up to.
Could turn to in trouble.
And now...
You wouldn't know where to begin.
Couldn't you begin by telling me what the trouble is?
What is the use?
We don't even speak the same language.
Mr. Richard Brindslay Sheridan.
The Countess de Tournay.
Mademoiselle de Tournay.
The Vicomte de Tournay.
Lord and Lady Elsworthy.
The Earl and Countess of Garrow.
Well, here's our French friend!
Bonsoir, "misu", as you say.
Good evening, Sir Percy.
Milady.
My dear, look at that cravat.
You're a monstrous quick learner, sir.
Permit me.
There...
Perfect. Perfect!
Another week, and we won't know you from an Englishman.
From an Englishman!
That is praise indeed!
Oh, Sir Percy!
What is this poem everybody is talking about?
- Poem?
- Yes! All about the Scarlet Pimpernel.
Do tell us!
Oh, gads, there's no escape.
Forgive me my dear.
Take our friend round and tell him who everybody is...
If anybody is anybody.
- That's exactly like you, Percy!
- That's like you.
I only want to know who one person is and you know the alternative..
The Pimpernel is under this roof at this moment among your friends.
Your move, milady.
And good luck.
Marguerite!
Suzanne!
Suzanne.
The thing rhymes, you see, in four places.
And if you can get a rhyme to rhyme...
That, uh, makes it a poem, if you follow me.
Yes, of course, but what is it?
"The Scarlet Pimpernel"
by Sir Percy Blakeney, Baronet.
Really, that's only the name!
Well, go on!
"They seek him here,
"They seek him there.
"Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.
"Is he in heaven?
"Is he in...
"That damned elusive...
Pimpernel.
That's marvelous!
It rhymes!
Oh yes!
It's a poem!
"They seek him here, "They seek him there.
"Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.
"Is he in heaven? "Is he in...
"That damned elusive Pimpernel!
- Oh, extraordinary.
- Marvelous!
You liked that?
Well, I could tell another one.
Zounds!
That's a monstrous good color!
Hastings!
Who made that coat?
Beagle  Beagle.
Odd's blood!
Sink me if they're not better than our master Treadle.
- Ffoulkes and Dewhurst are free.
- Escaped? No, released. They are coming here immediately.
Of course, that's why they were released.
To lead a trail to the rest of us.
I shall be in the library at midnight.
His Royal Highness...
The Prince of Wales.
Ladies, please.
Ladies, gentlemen, please.
Ah, Grenville!
Good evening, ladies!
Good evening, gentlemen!
Please, please!
Any news from France, Grenville?
- The worst, sir.
- The King?
Doomed.
Can't we do anything?
We recalled our ambassador a month ago.
Chauvelin had the impudence to accept my invitation.
Will Your Highness permit?
Monsieur Chauvelin the unofficial ambassador of the French government.
Monsieur, we will try to forget the government who sent you.
And look upon you as merely our guest.
A private gentleman from France.
As such are you welcome, monsieur.
Well, ladies...
Did you bet on my horse at Newmarket this afternoon?
I particularly love the whole...
But I didn't want to...
Lady Blakeney with a sad face?
Ha-ha, but sadness is for mere mortals, milady.
Never, never for goddesses.
Alas, even a goddess must have moments when she's a plain woman.
Zounds, madam!
Lady Blakeney could never become a plain woman at any moment.
Ha-ha, that's better!
Now, come and help me through my... my princely paces.
I crave your permission to present Your Royal Highness the Countess de Tournay, her daughter.
This is a pleasure, madam.
Charming, charming!
You and Lady Blakeney must become great friends, madam.
Her friends are my friends.
And her enemies, the enemies... of England.
We poor exiles, madam show our gratitude to England by our devotion to the wishes of Monseigneur.
Suzanne.
- Suzanne!
- Marguerite!
They were schoolfellows in the convent in Paris.
Ah-ha, charming, madam.
Your Royal Highness,
I accepted the Lord Grenville's gracious invitation solely to implore Your Highness to do something to save my husband.
Madam.
The government does everything in it's power to save those who are threatened by death in the prisons of the French Republic.
But if a country goes mad it has the right to commit every horror within it's own walls.
Hastings slipped a note into sir Andrew Ffoulkes' cuff.
Thank you, sir.
Ah, Lady Blakeney.
Won't you take pity on a lonely compatriot?
Are you asking me to dance with you?
Not with me.
With Sir Andrew Ffoulkes.
Why?
He has a note in his cuff.
- But listen, Chauvelin...
Your Royal Highness...
Your Graces...
My lords...
Ladies and gentlemen...
Pray take your places for the minuet.
Oh, please, it's nothing.
Just the heat.
Sir Andrew.
Would you be kind enough to see me upstairs?
Of course.
This way, Lady Blakeney. You'll be all right in a moment.
Lady Blakeney.
Shall I send for a physician?
No, no!
I'm so sorry...
I'll be all right in a minute.
Would you rather be left alone?
No.
Please don't leave me!
Just for a second.
I'll be all right.
How clever of you.
Almost as good as a burnt feather for faintness.
There...
I feel better already.
Would you be kind enough to bring me my fan?
It was a love letter.
And you sacrificed it for me.
What a shame.
But I'll ask her to write you another, shall I?
Suzanne!
Are you feeling better, darling?
I spoiled Sir Andrew's dance.
Would you make it up to him by finishing it for me?
Well?
Did you get it?
He burned it.
But I got a glimpse of what was left.
It began...
Well, go on.
"Start tomorrow myself..."
And ended...
"Will be in library at midnight".
Thank you, Mary. You can go to bed.
See that Sir Andrew Ffoulkes gets this.
My dear!
Percy!
All right, Brinker.
Well, my dear?
It's about Armand.
He's in the most terrible danger.
They've arrested him at Boulogne!
How do you know?
Chauvelin told me.
When?
Yesterday.
Well, why didn't you tell me when I asked you?
I don't know...
He threatened me.
Then why are you telling me now?
Because I thought you might do something for Armand!
You have influence at court.
Didn't you ask your friend Chauvelin for help?
He promised me that...
I don't trust him.
He promised you the life of your brother.
What did you give him in exchange?
What has happened to you, Percy?
Do you... hate me?
Why did you denounce the Marquis de St. Cyr?
So, that's it!
Why did you never ask me what the Marquis de St. Cyr did to me!
You didn't even know him.
No.
I didn't even know him.
Well, then.
But I knew his son.
I was only 17 when he asked me to marry him.
His father heard about it and had me arrested...
And sent to St. Lazare.
Do you know what St. Lazare is?
Do you know the sort of women that are sent there?
I would have killed myself.
Only...
Only what?
The Revolution came.
The ever-glorious 14th of July.
And I was free.
Why this tardy explanation?
I asked you once if you sent the St. Cyrs to the guillotine.
You believed it so easily, didn't you?
And yet...
I still ask myself.
"Am I really guilty of their deaths?"
If not you, who is?
He plotted with Austria.
I told a friend.
A man whom I thought a friend.
He denounced him.
The terror did the rest.
Who was that friend?
Was it Chauvelin?
He promised you your brother's life.
What price did you pay for it?
What price did you pay for it?
I paid a horrible price.
Well?
I betrayed the Scarlet Pimpernel.
How?
Ffoulkes had a scrap of paper in his cuff.
I read it and told Chauvelin the Pimpernel would be in the library at midnight.
And was he in the library at midnight?
Chauvelin says he wasn't.
But I think he is lying.
And through my betrayal a noble and generous man might lose his life.
What am I to do Percy?
How can I warn him?
Warn him?
Against what?
Against the danger that threatens him if he goes back to France!
My dear...
If he is the kind of lunatic I take him to be your warning won't stop him.
But he might be going to his death!
Well, that's all the fellow lives for.
Besides, he doesn't know you're in love with him.
I'm not in love with him.
I admire his heroism, but...
I don't love him.
Oh, but you do, only you don't know it.
I didn't know it myself until a moment ago.
Percy, please don't joke about it!
It's no joke.
Believe me.
Dangerous game, falling in love with a phantom, my dear.
For all you know, he may be a married man.
Who's deeply in love with his wife.
Never.
Why not?
Would any man who was in love with his wife leave her continually to face death?
Would you?
Me?
Zounds!
I'm much more romantic than you think.
In a case like that I wouldn't leave you.
Not even to go to my tailor.
The horses are ready, sir.
Thank you, Brinker.
Are you going away?
Oh, yes, didn't I tell you?
Important business in town.
Goodbye, my dear.
Your tailor, I suppose.
Not only my tailor, but also my bootmaker.
And incidentally...
I want to see what my influence is worth at court...
That little matter of your brother.
Perhaps I can help.
Oh, Percy, if you could...
I'd love you all my life.
Gad!
I must remember that, my dear.
Goodbye.
What is it Brinker?
It's 6 o'clock, milady.
I suppose you want me to leave this room.
I've never been here quite alone, have I?
No, milady.
All right, Brinker, thank you.
Percy!
Percy!
- Brinker!
Brinker!
- Milady.
A letter, to be delivered into your Lady's good hands.
- From Sir Percy?
- No, madam.
From his excellency, the French Ambassador.
Where's Monsieur Chauvelin?
He left this morning for France, madam.
All right, thank you.
Brinker!
The carriage.
Very good, milady.
Is Sir Andrew Ffoulkes in?
Yes, milady.
I'll call Sir Andrew, milady.
Lady Blakeney, what's happened?
Sir Andrew, there's no time to waste in talking.
Just listen to me.
Your leader and friend, the Scarlet Pimpernel
- My husband..
- How do you know that, milady?
Do not ask any questions now.
He is in deadly peril.
Chauvelin knows that Percy Blakeney and the Scarlet Pimpernel are one and the same.
How did Chauvelin come to know?
Through me.
Do you mean to say that you betrayed him?
Yes, yes, I betrayed him, never mind how just tell me this...
Has Percy left for Boulogne?
Yes.
- To save my brother?
- And de Tournay.
What is their meeting place in Boulogne?
Why?
- Do you want to...
- Oh, look at me, man!
Do I look like a woman who wants to send her husband to his death?
I want to find Percy, to warn him, to save him or to die with him.
I'll go with you.
Can you bring your friends?
Ten of them.
The rest are in France.
Percy has forbidden us to go over.
It will be the first time we've ever disobeyed him.
I'll save Percy even if I have to kill Chauvelin.
And if he goes to the guillotine...
I'll go after him.
There you are citizens!
Boulogne has a guillotine of it's own now.
Same as Paris!
That's nothing!
Half the towns in France have got them.
Let her go, Francois!
Good, eh?
So much for the bait.
Now for the trap.
We can't afford to make any mistakes this time.
Remember, it's either the Pimpernel or ourselves for the guillotine.
- Robespierre knows he is here.
- Yes. The net must be spread with more than cunning.
Blakeney's no fool.
Besides, he's a master of makeup and disguise.
He may turn up as an old woman a peddler with a pack, a peasant with a beard, anything!
They've got the Scarlet Pimpernel!
Quiet!
Quiet everybody!
Listen, my friend
The next time you want to put on a false beard
Choose a good one not a bird's nest that wouldn't deceive a child!
Clumsy idiot!
Let go, you!
I'll teach him to pull the best beard in Boulogne!
I've never been so insulted in my life!
You disgusting, gibbering monkeys!
You'll hear more of this!
An honest woman I am, one of the few in our street!
Stripped naked by soldiers and the searched to see if I was a man!
Listen, Captain.
If I were 20 years younger that's were I should be.
Bravo uncle!
That's the spirit!
Where are you boys serving now?
Oh, we're on leave.
Stealing away the hearts of the girls of Boulogne?
No sir, I'm in love.
Ah, you rascal.
It's the wife of another man?
No, it's my own.
Splendid!
Captain, I'll tell you a secret.
You and I are the only men in France who are in love with our wives. Hooray!
Let's drink to it!
Well, here's to it!
Here's to it!
But it'll be hard for you to leave her for this war with England. You think that's coming, do you?
Surely!
We shall have to teach perfidious Albion a lesson!
Well. it won't take us long to get across the channel. Will it, boys? No, no!
Well, gentlemen, good luck!
And... Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
De Tournay was brought here from Paris yesterday
The same prison as Armand.
I thought so.
Chauvelin's using them as bait.
Search every incoming ship.
Even the smallest fishing boat.
And you...
De Tournay and St. Just have escaped!
Escaped!
How? God knows.
The Pimpernel knows!
Someone will pay for this!
Where are the jailers?
Missing!
Citizen Chauvelin!
How dare you burst in?
Who are you?
Jailer from the prison!
- So you're the one...
- No fault of mine!
The head jailer would have killed me if I hadn't taken the money to free those accursed aristocrats!
What?
The Pimpernel is taking them to England.
Promised us all jobs there!
But I'm a good patriot, Citizen Chauvelin.
I'm not losing my head... because I got some information that will save yours.
What is it worth?
What do you know?
Where you can find the Scarlet Pimpernel.
Out with it!
Where?
He told us to meet him at 10 o'clock at the Lion d'Or.
Take him away.
10 o'clock at the Lion d'Or.##
Let fly foresheet!
Let fly foresheet!
There's the Lion d'Or.
Tell the men to get ready to row me ashore.
We must wait for the signal.
Brogard waves the lantern across the window for safe up and down for danger.
Look!
There's the signal.
Safe!
You've all the roads watched?
Every corner... and the beach.
And a troop of dragoons to surround the place?
Waiting outside.
Come on then...
The Lion d'Or.
Good evening.
What do you want here?
This is no place for one of your sort.
I'm the sort that pays well, Citizen Brogard.
For what?
For a seat by the fire.
I'll wait here for a friend of mine...
And yours.
What should I know of your friends?
You signaled him just now. You must be expecting him.
What time?
What time?
10 o'clock.
Where can I hide?
Quick, to the attic!
Citizen Brogard?
Yes?
Under arrest.
What for?
Betraying the Republic...
Helping the enemies of France...
Harboring a gang of dangerous criminals...
Smuggling aristocrats out of the country.
That's a lie!
You've got one chance.
Take it, or I'll hang you now from your own sign.
The leader of your gang is coming here tonight, isn't he?
Isn't he?
- Yes.
- What time?
He ordered his boat to be off the point at 10 o'clock.
Ah, but he'll call here for his passengers, won't he?
He might!
Might?
You'll look pretty swinging in the wind.
How does he know it's safe?
What is the signal?
A lantern in the attic window.
Waved up and down for danger... across the window when all is clear.
Come on. sergeant.
That is the wrong signal, Lady Blakeney.
That will keep Sir Percy away!
This is the right one.
This will bring him here.
I can see you are longing to see him
As I am myself.
What a great actor Sir Percy is.
A thousand ways to cheat the poor, stupid officials of the Republic.
Look, costumes, wigs, paint.
What will he be next?
In what disguise will he arrive when the clock strikes 10?
I must arrange a reassuring atmosphere for him.
An old woman?
No, he has overdone that.
A priest...
What could be more harmless?
And so useful when it comes to the last offices.
Sergeant...
You shall have the privilege of watching over the Republic's most charming prisoner for the rest of the evening.
Milady.
- Duroc
- Citizen?
Everything ready?
The dragoons should be here at any moment.
Arrange for a firing squad as soon as they arrive.
Are you so certain you'll get him?
Quite.
Thanks to a charming friend I found in there.
- What time is it?
- Quarter to 10.
Remember, he has to think his way is clear.
He must not suspect anything until he's in the trap.
Good evening, Monsieur Chauvelin.
How nice of you to wait up for me.
Well...
I had no idea you were in holy order.
This is only an innocent masquerade like so many of your own, Sir Percy.
Ah, but mine were successful.
Mine may prove successful yet.
You walked in here quite freely but you won't walk out a free man.
A prophet now, Monsieur Chauvelin.
The time for laughing is past, Sir Percy.
I've sought for a year.
Your energy, your ingenuity your audacity have been quite admirable.
But now...
The game is up!
Because all the trumps are in your hand, eh?
Precisely.
This house is surrounded by my soldiers.
I've only to raise my voice
Yes, yes, I see your point.
I see your point.
But suppose...
Suppose I could reach a door?
The night is black.
The sea is mine.
I make a dash!
I don't make a dash.
I don't need to.
Because one of my friends might shoot you...
From behind, hidden in that clock!
Oh, come now...
No one really hides in a clock.
Besides...
I still have...
One more avenue of escape...
Open to me.
Don't move!
Gunpowder!
If I drop this in here...
I fly straight to heaven.
And you know where you fly to.
Don't be alarmed Monsieur Chauvelin.
It's not gunpowder.
Thank you Wilmot.
You just arrived in time.
I've had five delightful minutes with Monsieur Chauvelin.
I trust there was time enough to get Armand and de Tournay into safety.
Yes, they're safe.
Good.
Now we need five minutes.
Then I shan't trouble you anymore.
For the moment.
We must have the password, Percy.
The password.
Do we have to use force?
Not at all, Sir Percy.
The password is, "The Channel is Free".
Splendid!
Wilmot...
You get them onto the ship.
I'll take care of our friend and join you in a minute.
That was quite sensible of you...
Monsieur Chauvelin.
Not at all, Sir Percy.
You may go...
Because I know you'll come back of your own free will.
You overestimate the charm of your society.
I told you once, the time for jesting was over.
I have all the trumps in my hand.
In that room upstairs, there's a woman under arrest who has forfeited her life by aiding the enemies of the Republic.
What woman?
Lady Blakeney.
Is the game up, Sir Percy?
Is this the last adventure?
I give up, Chauvelin.
What next?
There is a firing squad outside.
And my wife?
The Revolutionary Tribunal.
That means death!
It would have meant my death if I had not caught you!
Don't be alarmed, Sir Percy.
I don't want your wife's life.
She's free the moment you die.
I offer you a pact.
If you promise to say nothing to her...
If you'll send her on to my ship immediately...
I'll walk up in front of your firing squad.
I accept.
Sergeant!
Bring milady down.
Percy!
I wanted to give my life to save you.
- Forgive me, Percy.
- My dear, it's nothing!
I'm in no danger.
Percy.
I want to...
I want to die with you!
Don't move, Chauvelin.
Our parting would be too cruel, even for you.
Just take her out while she's still unconscious.
My boat should be at the point by now.
Good bye, my sweet.
It's good to know that...
That you loved me...
A little.
Duroc!
Send this lady to the English ship around the point.
If anybody attempts to land, shoot!
Yes, Citizen.
You two go with him.
Do you like poetry, Monsieur Chauvelin?
"That damned elusive Pimpernel".
No, no...
I mean, uh, poetry.
"This other Eden, demiparadise"
"This fortress built by nature for herself"
"Against infection and the hand of war"
"This happy breed of men"
"This little world"
"This precious stone, set in the silver sea"
"This blessed plot"
"This earth"
"This realm"
"This England"
Oh, damn me, I forget the rest.
Firing party, halt!
Left turn!
Ground muskets!
Duroc!
Zounds, now it appears I shan't have time to remember.
Shoulder muskets!
Left turn!
Quick march!
Ready!
Present.
Fire.
Finished?
I'm so sorry, Monsieur Chauvelin, I had to come back for my hat.
It's such a cursed good hat, you know.
Now, now, don't look at me like that!
Sink me, if you don't think I'm my own ghost.
Duroc!
Captain Duroc?
I'm afraid it will be an hour or so before poor Captain Duroc will be able to resume his duty.
I regret that I struck him rather violently.
Seize him!
Always so impulsive, my dear Monsieur Chauvelin.
This, ah... is my firing squad.
Allow me to present Ffoulkes, Dewhurst...
Hastings, Belville, and the rest.
But of course you know all about them.
You look rather excited, Chauvelin.
I think you need cooling down.
So...
Just a peaceful little nap...
Like we had in the Grenville library.
Are we really free, Percy?
Not you, darling.
Chauvelin said you'd be free the moment I died.
It won't be a moment sooner.
Land ahead!
Look, Marguerite!
England!
Stall, please.
Ladies and gentlemen... with your kind attention and permission...
I have the honor of presenting to you... one of the most remarkable men in the world.
- How remarkable?
- He's sweating.
Can you be surprised at that, gentlemen?
Every day he commits to memory 50 new facts... and remembers every one of them.
Facts from history, from geography, from newspapers... from scientific books, millions and millions of them.
Think of the strain involved by his prodigious feat.
His feet ain't half as big as yours, cully.
I'm referring to his feats of memory.
Test him, please.
Ladies and gentlemen, ask him your questions... and he will answer you, fully and freely.
Mr. Memory.
I also add, ladies and gentlemen, before retiring... that Mr. Memory has left his brain to the British Museum.
Hurray!
A question, please. Ladies first.
Where's my old man been since last Saturday?
- On the booze!
- In quod!
Out with his bit!
A serious question, please.
What won the Derby in 1921?
Mr. Jack Jool's Humorist with Steve Donoghue up.
Won by a length at odds 6 to 1.
Second and third: Craig-an-Eran and Lemonora.
- Am I right, sir?
- Right.
What won in 1936?
Come back in 1937, and I'll tell you.
How far is Winnipeg from Montreal?
What won the Cup in 1926?
- Cup? Waterloo, football or tea.
- Football, silly.
- When did Chelsea win it?
- 63 B.C. in the presence of Nero.
- What causes pip in poultry?
- Don't make yourself so common.
Our fowls have it, haven't they?
How many races did Mick the Miller win?
How old is Mae West?
When was Crippen hanged?
Who was the last British heavyweight champion of the world?
- Henry VIII!
- My old woman!
Bob Fitzsimmons.
He defeated Jim Corbett... heavyweight champion of America at Carson City, Nevada... in October, 1897.
He was 34 years of age. Am I right, sir?
How old is Mae West?
I know, sir, but I never tell a lady's age.
Next, please.
What causes pip in poultry?
- How far is Winnipeg from Montreal?
- Miss Winnie Who, sir?
How far is Winnipeg from Montreal?
A gentleman from Canada. You're welcome, sir.
Winnipeg, the third city of Canada and the capital of Manitoba.
Distance from Montreal: 1,424 miles.
- Am I right?
- Quite right.
How old's Mae West?
How old's Mae West?
Hey, you!
How old's Mae West?
Gentlemen! Please, you're not at home!
Hey, you!
What causes pip in... causes pip in po... po...
Hey, come on!
For God's sake, play something!
Stop them from running!
Here we are.
May I come home with you?
What's the idea?
I'd like to.
It's your funeral. Come on, there's a bus.
- You don't stay here always?
- No, I've taken a furnished flat.
I'm only here from Canada for a few months.
By the way, am I allowed to know your name?
- Smith.
- All right.
Do you want to know more about me?
What do you think I do for a living?
- Actress?
- Not in the way you mean.
- Chorus?
- No.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm a freelance.
- Out for adventure, eh?
- That's right.
This way. I'm afraid you'll find my sitting room all upset.
I haven't decorated. Wait till I find the switch.
Not yet.
Now.
Mr. Hannay, would you be kind and turn that mirror to the wall?
You'd be happier if there were curtains over those windows.
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.
There's the telephone. Just a minute.
- Don't answer the telephone.
- Why not?
Because I think it's for me. Please don't answer.
Just as you say.
- Won't you sit down?
- Would you kick that footstool to me?
You needed that.
I did. Thank you.
- I owe you an explanation.
- Don't bother about me.
- I'm nobody.
- We cannot talk here.
All right.
Just a minute.
- Okay? - Mm-hmm.
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
- There's our friend again.
- Take no notice.
Would you think me very troublesome if I asked for something to eat?
- I've had nothing all day.
- Sure.
- You like haddock?
- Yes, please.
I suppose your name isn't really Smith.
It depends on where I am.
- You may call me Annabella.
- Annabella Smith.
A clergyman's daughter, I presume.
Hello. Nervy? Upset by those shots tonight?
I fired those shots.
- You what?
- Yes, to create a diversion.
I had to get away from that theater quickly.
There were two men there who wanted to kill me.
You should be more careful in choosing your gentlemen friends.
- You don't understand.
- You don't make it easy for me.
Beautiful, mysterious woman pursued by gunmen.
Sounds like a spy story.
That's exactly what it is.
- Only I prefer the word agent better.
- "Agent"?
- For what country?
- Any country that pays me.
- What is your country?
- I have no country.
Born in a balloon? We'll let that go.
I suppose you've come here... to dig up some great big state secret.
I am here to save a secret from being divulged.
A very important secret for this country.
Not because I love England, but because it will pay me better.
- Thank you.
- The very brilliant agent... of a certain foreign power... is on the point of obtaining a secret vital to your air defense.
I tracked two of his men to that music hall.
Unfortunately, they recognized me.
- That's why they're after me now.
- That was too bad.
You ever heard of a thing called "persecution mania"?
- You don't believe me?
- Frankly, I don't.
Go and look down into the street then.
You win.
- Are they there?
- Yes.
I'd hoped I'd shaken them off.
I'm going to tell you something which is not very healthy to know.
But now that they have followed me here... you are in it as much as I am.
How do you mean?
- Have you ever heard of the 39 Steps? - No.
What's that, a pub?
Never mind.
But what you were laughing at is true.
These men will stop at nothing.
I'm the only person who can stop them.
If they are not stopped, it's only a matter of days, perhaps hours...
- before the secret is out.
- Why don't you phone the police?
Because they wouldn't believe me any more than you did.
If they did, how long do you think it would take to get them going?
These men act quickly.
You don't know how clever their chief is.
- Clever and ruthless.
- Who is he? What's his name?
He has a dozen names, and he can look like a hundred people.
But one thing he cannot disguise: this.
Part of his little finger is missing.
If ever you should meet a man with no top joint there...
- be very careful, my friend.
- Thanks. I'll make a note of it.
Meanwhile, what are you going to do?
First, I'll eat my haddock... then, if you are not going to turn me out onto the street...
- have a good night's rest.
- You're welcome to my bed.
I'll get a shakedown on the couch.
Anything else I can get you?
- A map of Scotland.
- Why Scotland?
There's a man in Scotland whom I must visit next if anything is to be done.
Are the 39 Steps in Scotland, by any chance?
Perhaps I'll tell you tomorrow.
Clear out, Hannay. They'll get you next.
What you were laughing at just now is true.
These men will stop at nothing.
There's a man in Scotland... whom I must visit next if anything is to be done.
It is only a matter of days, perhaps hours... before the secret is out of the country.
The police will not believe me any more than you did.
I tell you, these men act quickly.
Quickly. Quickly.
Good morning, sir. You're up bright and early this morning.
Could you use a pound note, brother?
- What's the catch?
- I want to borrow your cap and coat.
- What's all this? What's the big idea?
- I want to make a getaway.
- To a bunk?
- Yes.
- What have you been up to?
- I'll have to trust you.
There's been a murder up on the first floor.
- By you?
- No, by those two men out there.
I see.
I suppose they're waiting there for a copper to come and arrest them.
It's quite true. They're spies, foreigners.
They've murdered a woman in my flat, and now they're waiting for me.
Come off it. Funny jokes at 5:00 in the morning.
All right. I'll tell you the truth.
- Are you married?
- Yes, but don't rub it in.
- What's the idea now?
- I'm not. I'm a bachelor.
A married woman lives on the first floor.
- Does she?
- Yes. I've just been paying her a call.
- Now I want to go home.
- What's preventing you?
One of those men is her brother, the other's her husband.
Why didn't you tell me before? I only wanted to be told.
Trying to keep me with tales about murders and foreigners.
Here, put this on. Put on my hat. There you are.
- Take the pound.
- No, sir, you're welcome to it.
You'd do the same for me one day.
Lead the pony around the corner.
- So long, old sport.
- Good-bye. Thank you.
Oy! The empties!
Papers, magazines, chocolates, cigarettes.
There he is.
For one thing, they're much prettier than they were 20 years ago.
- More free. Free and easy.
- You're right there.
I could never understand how people used to put up with the old-fashioned sort.
All bones and no bend.
- The old-fashioned did last longer.
- I don't know.
Mine last about a year. Here, I'll show you.
Big demand for these now.
- The old-fashioned sort.
- Brrr! My wife.
Now look at these.
- Our new Streamline Model Number 1.
- Anything go with it?
I should say so. This.
Put a pretty girl inside those, and she needn't be ashamed of herself.
- Bring it back to me when it's filled.
- I will. What's this? Edinburgh, Waverley.
We're getting on. - Pardon us for talking business, sir.
- Certainly.
- Good day.
- Good day, sir.
Good day.
- Good day.
- Broad-minded old geezer.
Bet he's very good at charades.
- I wonder what won the 2:00 at Windsor.
- I don't know. Let's get a paper.
- Paper.
- Say, son, speak the English?
Dispatch.
- Hello.
- What won it?
There's been another woman murdered in a West End flat.
- What?
- "Woman murdered in West End flat."
These sex dramas don't appeal to me. What won?
- Bachelor Bud. Seven to four odds.
- Good. Not so good.
Portland Mansions, Portland Place.
By the BBC.
That's a nice, quiet place to put someone to sleep.
- "Good night, everybody."
- That's a good one.
What was she like? One of the usual?
"A well-dressed woman of about 35 with a knife in her back.
The tenant, Richard Hannay, is missing."
You surprise me.
"At 7:00 this morning, the charwoman, Elizabeth Briggs..."
If that isn't the blasted limit.
- What's the matter now?
- Is there no honesty in this world?
I ask you. "The new Bodyline rubber panty corset.
On sale today. McCutcheon Brothers, Princess Street.
Price: 17 and 9.
Brassiere to match:
4 and 11 ." You get that?
The Bodyline. One and three cheaper than our Streamline.
No use going to Aberdeen now.
- Might I have a look at your paper?
- Certainly.
- Thank you.
- Quite all right.
There's enough evidence there to hang any man.
What can I do for you, sir?
Can you tell me what station the train stops at next?
Do you think I'm a railway porter? Go find out for yourself.
- I can tell a better one than that.
- You couldn't. That was very funny.
You liked it?
Have you heard the one about the young lady of Bulgar?
- I can't remember them all.
- You must hear that.
- There was a young lady of Bulgar.
- Yes, we...
- Taking tea, sir?
- Yes. Thank you.
Darling, how lovely to see you!
Young man having a free meal in there.
I was desperate. I'm terribly sorry. I had to do it.
My name's Hannay. They're after me.
I swear I'm innocent.
You've got to help me.
I've got to keep free for the next few days.
Have you seen a man pass in the last few minutes?
This is the man you want, I think.
- But when we passed just now...
- He told me his name was Hannay.
- Is your name Hannay?
- Are you coming into tea, sir?
I'll be right along.
Pull that cord!
Stay away. Go on, men. Go down there.
Get on with it.
Heel! Why did you pull the communication cord?
- To stop the train, you old fool.
- It's against all the regulations...
- to stop the train on the bridge.
- A man jumped out.
He's a murderer. We've got to take him.
- Which way did he go?
- He must have jumped off here.
- I can't see him.
- Are you sure he jumped?
- I cannot wait here any longer!
- There he is, getting on the train.
- No, that's a passenger.
- It's him, I tell you!
Come on, then.
- Hannay escapes! Paper!
- Hannay escapes! Paper!
Extra special! Hannay escapes from police!
Paper!
Extra, extra! Paper!
Correct. Height: about five foot ten.
Small moustache.
Last seen wearing a dark suit... but he may have obtained a change of clothing.
- Good day.
- And to you.
- What'll your business be?
- I'm a motor mechanic looking for a job.
- You'll find no work here.
- Are there no big houses around here?
Only Sir Andrews. He won't be wanting you.
He's had the same chauffeur for 40 years.
I didn't know there had been cars that long.
He was coachman besides when he was a boy.
I see. What's that?
That's the manse. But the minister has no motorcar.
Are there no newcomers?
Aye. There's an Englishman, a professor.
- A professor?
- He lives in Alt-na-Shellach.
- Where?
- On the other side of the loch.
- Would that be near that village?
- It would. Thanks. I'll try there.
- You won't try tonight. It's 14 miles.
- Could I get a lift in that van?
No, it's going the other way.
I guess you're right. Could you put me up for the night?
- Free?
- No, I'll pay.
- All right. Can you eat herring?
- I could eat a half dozen right now.
- Can you sleep in a box bed?
- I can try. - Two and six.
- Take it now. Thank you.
Go in with the gentleman.
He'll stay with us till tomorrow morning.
- Your daughter?
- My wife.
- Will you now come in?
- Thank you.
Here's your bed.
I'll lift these things.
- Could you sleep there?
- You try and stop me.
You'll be tired.
I'll say I am.
I'm on the tramp, looking for a job.
Won't you sit down while I go on with our supper?
Thank you.
- Have you been in these parts long?
- No, I'm from Glasgow.
- Did you ever see it?
- No.
You should see Sauchiohall Street with all its fine shops... and Argyll Street on a Saturday night... with the trams and the lights... and the cinema palaces and their crowds.
And it's Saturday night tonight.
You certainly don't get those things out here.
No.
You miss them?
Sometimes.
I've never been to Glasgow, but I've been to Edinburgh... and Montreal and London.
I'll tell you all about London at supper.
- John wouldn't approve of that.
- Why not?
He says it's best not to think of such places and the wickedness there.
Why not listen now before he comes back?
What do you want to know?
Is it true that all the ladies paint their toenails?
Some of them.
- Do London ladies look beautiful?
- They do.
But they wouldn't if you were beside them.
- You ought not say that.
- What ought he not to say?
I was saying I prefer living in town than the country.
God made the country.
- Is the supper ready, woman?
- Aye. - Do you mind if I look at your paper?
- I don't mind.
Thank you.
- You did not tell me your name.
- Hammond.
Well, Mr. Hammond, if you'll put down that paper, I'll say a blessing.
Of course.
Sanctify these bounteous masses to us miserable sinners.
O Lord, make us truly thankful... for them and for all Thy manifold blessings.
Continually turn our hearts... from wickedness... and from worldly things... unto Thee.
Amen.
I forgot to lock the barn.
There are cars coming.
It'll be the police. You best be going.
- Thank you. I was having a grand sleep.
- Don't let them catch you.
All right. I'll never forget you for doing this for me.
- Which way do I go?
- I'll show you.
Aye. I might have known.
Making love behind my back.
- Get out. You too.
- Just a minute...
- Get out of my house before I...
- Aye.
Go. - And leave you like this?
- It's your chance at liberty.
You don't understand.
You're all wrong about this. She was only trying to help me.
Aye, to bring shame and disgrace upon my house.
She was helping me to escape from the police.
- The police?
- Yes, they're after me for murder.
- What?
- They're here.
She was only warning me. I had to tell her last night.
Don't let them in. Say I'm not here.
I'll make it worth your while.
- How much?
- Five pounds.
Have you got that much? Give it to me.
After they've gone.
Get back into bed. Shut him in. Hide him.
- Not there. I do not trust him.
- But he took the money.
He could not resist it. Here.
Have you seen a stranger about here?
What kind of a stranger?
I was right.
He's asking if there's a reward if you get catched.
He'll argue about it for a moment longer before he lets them in.
Now's your time. Your jacket's terrible light-colored.
I'm a-feared they'll see you.
- You best take this one.
- Is this your husband's coat?
His Sunday best one, but never mind. They must not see you.
- What will happen to you?
- I'll say I couldn't stop you.
- He'll not ill treat you?
- He'll pray at me, but no more.
- What's your name?
- Margaret.
Good-bye, Margaret. I'll never forget you for this.
There he goes!
Spread out in a line.
- Is the master in?
- What name should I say, sir?
He wouldn't know my name.
Ask if he knows Miss Annabella Smith.
- Would you wait here while I inquire?
- Yes. Go on.
We'd better make inquiries here.
Somebody may have seen him through the windows.
- There's been a couple motorcars here.
- Aye. Murderers do not make calls in motorcars.
- Good day, dear.
- The same to you.
Have you seen any strangers this morning?
There's a few callers upstairs now, but they're not strangers.
You haven't seen any suspicious-looking bodies outside the windows...
- or calling at the house?
- No, sir.
There hasn't been anybody near here for the last half hour.
- You're from Annabella Smith?
- Yes.
We're just having a few drinks to celebrate my daughter's birthday.
Give me five minutes, then we can talk.
- Of course.
- Come meet my wife. Louisa, my dear.
I've another guest for you. This is Mr...
- I forgot to ask your name.
- Hammond.
He's come to see me on business, all the way from London.
There's a police inspector at the door.
He wants to speak to you.
At the door?
All right. I'll deal with it.
- Take him in, my dear.
- Come and meet my daughters.
- This is Patricia.
- How do you do?
Mrs. Bailey. Mrs. Hutchins.
Hilary, my dear, this is Mr. Hammond.
- He just arrived from London.
- How do you do?
Forgive the orgy.
We've been to church and the sermon lasted 45 minutes.
- This is Captain and Mrs. Ogilvey.
- How do you do?
- Have a drink?
- Thank you.
This is Derek Stewart.
And this is Sheriff Watson. You've got to be polite to him.
He's our Sheriff Substitute. Scotch for a local beat.
He'll give you six months hard as soon as look at you.
It's all right. Don't worry. I've sent them away.
Come and look at the view from this window.
We're rather proud of it.
- When will you catch that murderer?
- What murderer?
The man that stuck a carving knife into that woman last week.
- He's here in the district.
- How exciting. Where?
Somewhere about. He's been on the moors.
Sheriff Ames, why don't you catch him?
You wouldn't like me to be stuck in the back with a carving knife.
It's no business of mine to catch him.
You catch him, and I'll convict him.
- Is there a reward?
- It's nearly 1:00. We must leave.
- The professor wants his lunch.
- There's no hurry, my dear.
Still, if you must go... Pat, ring for Captain Ogilvey's car.
Yes, sir.
Are you coming out?
Come show us your new car.
- Come again another time.
- Good-bye. We'd love to.
Whenever you catch him, you'll find me at the Sherif Court every morning.
- Bring him along.
- Good-bye.
Louisa, if you'll excuse us...
Mr. Hammond and I want to have a chat before lunch.
Now, Mr. Hannay...
I suppose it's safe to call you by your real name now.
What about our mutual friend, Annabella?
- She's been murdered.
- "Murdered"?
The Portland Mansions affair.
Why our friends outside are looking for you.
- I didn't do it.
- Of course you didn't.
But why come all this way to Scotland to tell me?
I believe she was coming to see you about some Air Ministry secret.
She was killed by a foreign agent who was interested too.
- Did she tell you what he looked like?
- There wasn't time.
One thing: Part of his little finger was missing.
- Which one?
- This one, I think.
Sure it wasn't this one?
- Lunch is ready, dear.
- I'm coming right away.
I've been guilty of leading you down the garden path.
Or should it be up? I never can remember.
It seems to be the wrong garden, all right.
Well.
- What are we going to do?
- That's just the point.
What are we going to do about it?
I live here as a respectable citizen.
You must realize that my whole existence would be jeopardized... if it became known that I'm not what I seem.
Mr. Hannay, why have you come here?
Why have you forced me into this difficult position?
I can't lock you up in a room or anything like that.
There's my wife and daughters to think of.
I don't know what to think. Really, I don't.
Making it doubly important that I shouldn't let you go is...
I'm about to convey some very vital information out of the country.
Yes, I've got it.
Poor Annabella would have been too late.
- That's fair.
- Yes. What about it?
- What about what?
- Yourself.
- It seems there's only one way out.
- What's that?
Supposing I left you alone with this revolver?
Tomorrow's newspapers would announce that the Portland Place murderer...
- had taken his own life.
- I thought you were coming directly.
We've all been waiting.
- Will Mr. Hammond be staying?
- I don't think so, dear.
Well, what do you think, Mr. Hannay?
I'm afraid you leave me no alternative.
I cannot find my hymn book.
- Where did you leave it?
- In the breast pocket of my overcoat.
It was hanging here.
I'm afraid I gave it to that gentleman who was staying here that night.
Cigarette cases, yes, but I've never seen it happen to a hymn book before.
And this bullet stuck among the hymns, eh?
I'm not surprised.
Some of those hymns are terrible hard to get through.
I've stuck in them myself before now.
I'm not complaining, Sheriff. "Hymns that have helped me."
That's a good one! That's fine.
And to think I was drinking his champagne only half an hour before.
It's a lesson to us all: not to mix with doubtful company on the Sabbath.
And how did you escape?
If you look through the window, you'll see.
They put the body in the dressing room.
When I came to, I borrowed this suit and pinched his car.
I don't want to hurry you, but shouldn't we take steps?
This is serious.
Otherwise, I wouldn't put myself in your hands...
- with a murder charge hanging over me.
- Never heed the murder.
You'll be able to convince Scotland Yard of your innocence... as easily as you've convinced me.
I'll need a short statement I can forward to the proper authority.
I have someone coming from the police station to take it down.
Thank you.
- Are you wishing to see me?
- Indeed, I am.
Do you think I enjoy playing for time with a murderer?
- "Murderer"?
- Certainly.
You're under arrest on the charge of willful murder... of a woman unknown in Portland Mansions, London on Tuesday last.
- Take him over to the county jail.
- Every word of my story is true.
We are not so daft in Scotland as some smart Londoners may think.
Do you think I believed your cock-and-bull story about the professor?
He's my best friend in the district.
Get me Professor Jordan.
If the professor didn't shoot me, where did that bullet come from?
That's easy. From one of your pursuers on the moor.
- Isn't that so, inspector?
- I had a shot at him myself.
I demand you allow me to telephone the High Commissioner for Canada in London.
You better do that from London.
You'll be there soon enough.
It'll save you the cost of a trunk call.
That's the professor's car.
Hannay must be inside spilling the beans.
- Stop him!
- My God!
How do you do? We're all waiting for you.
Pamela's gone to meet you at the station. This way.
Leader and standard-bearer himself.
I welcome this opportunity of discussing with you... another question vital to the import of our country... at this critical and momentous hour.
But first of all, as a preliminary to this...
- I shall occupy your time...
- You've occupied too much time already!
We've had enough of you!
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm now going to call upon the speaker of the evening.
- Speak up!
- There's no need to say who he is... or to speak of his brilliant record as a soldier and a statesman.
He's a son of Scotland who has crossed the border and conquered England.
He is now one of the foremost figures... in the diplomatic political world in the great city of London.
I'm, therefore, going to ask him to tell you something...
- It's about time too.
- How important it is... to this constituency that at this crucial by-election... our candidate should be returned by an adequate majority.
I now ask for Captain Fraser.
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for my hesitation in rising just now... but I'd entirely failed while listening... to the chairman's flattering description of the next speaker... to realize he was talking about me.
As for you, may I say from the bottom of my heart... and with the utmost sincerity... how delighted and relieved I am to find myself... in your presence at this moment.
Delighted because of your friendly reception... relieved because so long as I stand on this platform...
I am delivered from the cares and anxieties... which must always be the lot of a man in my position.
When I journeyed up to Scotland a few days ago... traveling on the Highland Express over that magnificent Forth Bridge... that monument to Scottish engineering and Scottish muscle...
That is to say, on that journey I had no idea that in a few days time...
I should find myself addressing an important political meeting.
I had planned a very different program for myself.
A very different program.
You'd be for the moors to shoot something.
Or somebody. I'm a rotten shot.
Anyhow, I little thought I should be speaking tonight... in support of that brilliant, young statesman.
That rising...
The gentleman on my right... already known among you as one destined to make... no uncertain mark in politics.
In other words, your future member of Parliament... your candidate, Mr...
McCrocodile.
He doesn't know the candidate's name.
I know your candidate will forgive my referring to him... by the friendly nickname by which he's already known... in anticipation, mark you... at Westminster.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, we'll discuss some topic.
What shall it be?
- The herring fisheries!
- Unemployment!
- What about the idle rich?
- That's an old-fashioned topic... especially for me because I'm not rich and I've never been idle.
I've been pretty busy all my life, and I expect to be much busier soon.
Have you ever worked with your hands?
Indeed I have.
I've known what it is to feel lonely and helpless... and have the whole world against me.
Those are things that no man or woman ought to feel.
I ask your candidate... and all those who love their fellowmen... to set themselves resolutely to make this world a happier place to live in.
A world where no nation plots against nation... where no neighbor plots against neighbor... where there is no persecution or hunting down... where everybody gets a square deal and a sporting chance... and where people try to help and not to hinder.
A world from which suspicion and cruelty... and fear have been forever banished.
That is the sort of world I want!
Is that the sort of world you want?
Fine!
That's all I have to say. Good night!
- I kept them going as long as I could.
- You're a difficult man to follow.
I suppose you think you've been damn clever.
- Tell your prisoner not to insult me.
- Try and stop me.
- Come along with me.
- I was speaking the truth.
You must have seen I was genuine.
Whether you believe me or not, will you put a telephone call through... to High Commissioner for Canada in London?
- Tell him an important secret...
- That will do now.
An important secret is being taken out of this country by a foreign agent.
I can't do anything myself because of this fool of a detective.
- Has that penetrated?
- Right to the funny bone.
- Now tell me another one.
- Haven't you any sense at all?
Put that call through! I beg of you! Refer them to me.
- Will you do this?
- No. Good night.
I beg pardon, miss, but we should like you to come too.
- Whatever for?
- To identify the prisoner formally.
- Will you come to the police station?
- What?
- It's only for a few minutes.
- If it's necessary, let's get it over.
Now you.
- Must I sit next to this man?
- It's only for a short time.
Be as quick as you can.
All right.
Isn't that the police station? We're running past it.
- Tell the man.
- You must have misunderstood me.
We're not exactly going to this police station.
- Where are we going?
- To Inverary.
- Inverary?
- Yes, miss.
This man is to be questioned by the Sheriff Principal.
- We have orders to take him there.
- You have no orders to take me.
No, miss, but I'm afraid you must go.
I'll see you're sent back as early as possible.
- How far is it to Inverary?
- Forty miles.
- Keep quiet.
- Sorry.
- We'll be there in less than two hours.
- I'm spending half the night with you?
It looks like it.
Isn't the man going the wrong way?
Surely that's the way to Inverary.
There's a bridge fallen down on that road.
We shall have to go around. The man knows the way.
- Might I see your warrant? - Shut your mouth.
You'll see it soon.
Would you like to have a small bet with me, Pamela?
All right, I'll have it with you, Sherlock.
I'll lay you 100 to 1 that your Sheriff Principal... has the top joint of his little finger missing.
What about it?
I win.
What are we stopping for?
It's a whole flock of detectives.
They're all over the road. Get out and clear them away.
- What about him?
- I'll soon fix that.
There, miss. Now you're a Special Constable.
- What's the idea?
- As long as you stay, he stays.
Yes, and as long as I go, you go. Come on.
Stop them! They got away!
- Come on.
- I won't!
Won't you?
- You're hurting me.
- Shut up.
See if they've gone down that way.
Where could they have gone?
Help!
Let me go!
One yip out of you, and I'll shoot you first and myself after.
There's nobody down here, I tell you.
Come up here, blast you, and don't waste any more time.
Spread out and find them.
They must be a mile away by now.
Don't do that.
Do stop whistling.
You can't possibly escape.
What chance have you got tied to me?
That question's for your husband.
I'll admit you're the white man's burden.
I know, and I can't tell you what comfort that thought gives me.
What's the use of this?
Those policemen will get you as soon as it's daylight.
They may get me, but they're not policemen.
- When did you find that out?
- You found that out yourself.
I should never have known that was the wrong road to Inverary.
They were taking us to their boss, and God help us if they ever catch us again.
I see.
You're still sticking to your penny novelette spy story.
Oh!
There are 20 million women in this island, and I'm chained to you.
Listen, once more. I'm telling you the truth.
I told you once in the train.
I tried to tell you after the election meeting.
I'm telling you now for the third time.
There's a conspiracy against this island and we're the only ones who can stop it.
Think what you've seen happen right under your very nose.
The gallant knight to the rescue.
All right, then I'm just a plain, common murderer... who stabbed an innocent, defenseless woman in the back not four days ago.
How do you come out over that?
I don't know how innocent you may be... but you're a woman, you're defenseless, and you're alone... on a desolate moor in the dark, manacled to a murderer... who'd stop at nothing to get you off his hands.
If that's the situation you prefer, have it, my lovely, and welcome.
I'm not afraid of...
For all you know, I may murder a woman a week.
So listen to a bit of advice.
Do every single thing I tell you to do, and do it quick.
You big bully.
I like your pluck. Come on.
- We're going in there.
- What for?
That's my business. Remember what I said: the civil tongue or else.
We're going in there, and you'll back me up on everything I say or do.
- Has that penetrated the ivory dome?
- Only just.
Pull yourself together.
Put your hand in my pocket and look in a hurry.
Come along.
Come in. The young lady's terrible wet.
We had an accident with our car a few miles back.
- You'll be staying the night?
- Yes.
We've just the one room left with the one bed in it.
- But you'll not be minding that.
- No, quite the reverse.
- You're man and wife, I suppose?
- Yes.
Uh, yes.
- Have you any luggage?
- We left that behind in the car.
Maybe I could lend the young lady a nightgown.
Will you please to register? James, the book.
- Aye.
- I'll light the fire for you.
- Will you be needing supper?
- No, thank you.
Just a whiskey and soda and a few sandwiches.
- And a glass of milk.
- Very well, sir.
Can't write with my left hand, but I can shoot with it.
You can guess what's in this pocket.
You sign, darling.
The sooner you get used to your new name, the better.
Off we go. "Mr. and Mrs. Henry Hopkinson, The Hollyhocks, Hammersmith."
I'll be back in a minute, chaps.
Off with that wet skirt, and I'll have it dried in the kitchen.
Don't bother. it'll dry in front of the fire just as well.
Thanks all the same.
No doubt the gentleman will take care of you.
Good night, sir. Good night, ma'am.
Good night.
Good night.
- Is he married to her, do you think?
- I do not care.
They are so terrible in love with each other.
I'm going to tell them the whole story.
You want to hang me for a murder I never committed?
As long as they hang you, I don't care whether you committed it or not.
Do you think I'm going to spend the night with you?
- Of course. What else can you do?
- Can I come in?
Come here.
Come in.
We were just getting warm before the fire.
I can see that. I thought you'd like this in your bed.
Thank you very much.
You'd like a hot water bottle, wouldn't you?
Say yes, darling.
- Yes, darling.
- Very well.
- Please don't go.
- Why not?
Is anything wrong?
Of course there's nothing wrong.
She just wants to tell you something.
- We're a runaway couple.
- I knew it. They're after you?
You won't give us away, will you? Please.
Of course we will not give you up.
A good night to you both.
- You'll not be disturbed.
- But...
Thank God for a bite to eat. Come along.
There you are.
What's the next item on the program?
- Get these things off.
- Right. How will we set about it?
Anything in that bag of yours that will help?
- A pair of scissors or a hairpin?
- Do you think a nail file would help?
Easily. it'll take about ten years, but we can try it.
Let's make ourselves comfortable.
What about that skirt of yours? It's still pretty damp.
I don't want to be tied to a pneumonia case on top of everything else.
- Take it off. I don't mind.
- I'll keep it on, thank you.
And that is that.
My shoes and stockings are soaked.
I think I'll take them off.
That's the first sensible thing I've heard you say.
- Can I be of any assistance?
- No, thank you.
Sorry.
- Hold this.
- Yeah.
Half a minute.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
- Do you like your milk now?
- No, thank you. I'll wait a little.
All right.
Cheerio.
That's better.
- Are your feet quite warm again?
- Yes, thanks.
Come on.
Will you kindly place yourself on the operating table?
Nobody's gonna hurt you. This is Armistice Day.
- Let's get some rest while we can.
- I'm not going to lie on this bed.
So long as you're chained to me, you'll lie wherever I lie.
- We're the Siamese twins.
- Don't gloat.
Do you think I'm looking forward to waking up in the morning... and seeing your face beside me, unwashed and shiny?
What a sight you'll be.
Give me that nail file. Let's have a go at this.
Thank you.
There I go again.
I wish I could get that damn tune out of my head.
I wonder where I heard it.
- You sound very sleepy.
- Sleepy? I'll say so.
Do you know when I last slept in a bed?
Saturday night, whenever that was.
Then I only got a couple of hours.
- What made you wake so soon? Dreams?
- What do you mean "dreams"?
I've always been told murderers have terrible dreams.
But only at the first. Got over that a long time ago.
When I first took to crime, I was quite squeamish about it.
- I was a most sensitive child.
- You surprise me.
Used to wake screaming, thinking the police were after me.
But one gets hardened.
- How did you start?
- Quite a small way, like most of us.
Pilfering pennies from other children's lockers at school... then a little pocket picking, then a spot of car pinching... then smash and grab and so on to plain burglary.
Killed my first man when I was 19.
In years to come, you'll be able to take your grandchildren... to Madame Tussaud's and point me out.
- Which section?
- It's early to say. I'm still young.
But I'll be there, all right, in one department or another.
You'll point me out and say, "Chicks, if I were to tell you... how matey I once was with that gentleman, you'd be..."
- What's the matter?
- This handcuff is pinching my wrist.
Sorry.
Talking of Madame Tussaud's, that's how it all began.
- What began?
- My career of crime.
All hereditary. Great Uncle Penruddock.
- Who was he?
- My girl, where were you brought up?
Never heard of my Great Uncle Penruddock, the Cornish Bluebeard?
- Got it all from him.
- I thought your family came from Canada.
No, that's where they went after the Penruddock incident.
He murdered three wives and got away with it.
His third mother-in-law got the goods on him and tried to have him arrested.
Did she succeed?
No, he was too quick for her.
Took her for a walk to Land's End and shoved her into the Atlantic Ocean.
He's in Madame Tussaud's.
There's no doubt about his department.
You must go down and see him sometime.
Can't mistake him. Third on the left as you go in.
Red whiskers and a harelip.
That, lady, is the sad story of my life.
Poor orphan boy who never had a chance.
Are you still set on giving me up to the police?
You're sure everything's going to be all right?
Bound to be. He can't have much time.
As soon as I've picked up you know what, I'll clear out of the country.
Be careful.
Wire to me.
- Good-bye, my dear.
- Good-bye.
Is that Professor Jordan's house?
Can I speak to Mrs. Jordan then?
Is that Mrs. Jordan?
He's gone to London already?
- If you manage, I'd like hot whiskey.
- I'll get the hot water.
No, he ducked down a side street, the police went the wrong way.
The girl handed him over to us, thinking we were detectives.
We had to take her as well because he told her everything.
Very good, ma'am. I see. Yes, ma'am.
- Well?
- The old man's got the wind up.
- He's cleared out already.
- Whatever for?
He thought it too dangerous with Hannay on the loose.
He's warning the whole 39 Steps.
- Has he got the... you know?
- Yes.
He's picking up our friend at the London Palladium on the way out.
Here's toddy. That will be half a crown.
- And the phone call?
- We'll say a schilling.
- Is this a hotel as well?
- Aye.
- Do you have people staying here?
- Aye.
- You get a few this time of year?
- Aye.
- Did you have anyone in tonight? - Aye.
They weren't by any chance a young couple?
James, do not finish!
What kind of a silly creature am I married to?
Do you want to get us all jailed?
- How much did you take for these?
- Half a crown.
Out, the pair of you!
Do not let on to anybody that you got a drink here after hours.
Ohh!
You old fool. Would you give away a young couple?
Good morning.
What's the idea? How did we get out of these?
You didn't.
I slipped out of mine last night and camped out here.
- Why didn't you run away?
- I did, but just as I was going...
I discovered that you've been speaking the truth.
I decided to stay.
May I ask what earthquake caused your brain to work at last?
Those two men were in here last night.
I overheard them telephoning.
- What did they say?
- A lot of stuff about the 39 Steps.
- You... Go on.
- What?
Someone's going to warn them. How can you warn steps?
- Never mind. Go on.
- Yes, and there was another thing.
Someone got scared and is clearing out and...
Yes, I know.
And is picking up someone at the London Palladium.
London Palladium? What the devil?
Is that the professor with half of the little finger missing?
What does he want to go there for?
I feel such a fool, not having believed you.
That's all right.
We ought to get a move on.
- What room are those two men in?
- No room.
They went as soon as they telephoned.
- They what?
- Didn't I tell you?
You let them go after hearing what they said?
- You button-headed little idiot.
- Don't talk to me like that!
Four or five precious hours wasted!
Why didn't you wake me up at once?
Even you might have realized what they said was important.
Why not leave well enough alone?
Let well alone? Good girl, I'm accused of murder!
Can't you realize the only way I can clear myself is to expose these spies?
You still can. The man's going to the London Palladium. Really?
First or second house?
I'll get there five hours late! - Fine!
The show will suit you. - What's that?
Crazy Month!
You're quite right, madame.
The Air Ministry has got a new thing a lot of people are interested in.
But they are positive that no papers are missing about it... that would be of any use to a spy.
I'm certain about it.
A man is leaving the country tonight with something.
Since you phoned us from Scotland this morning... we've made the minutest inquiries.
It's obvious I'm wasting my time here.
Just a moment, miss, please.
There's one thing you haven't told us.
Where's Richard Hannay?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Look here, miss, you can't...
- You're in the telephone book?
- Yes.
If anything crops up, we'll give you a ring.
That will be all now. Thank you.
Tell Archer and Seagrave to get another taxi and follow that girl.
She'll lead us to Hannay.
Love is a flower that blooms
Cover every exit, and on no account let anyone leave the building.
You two men go in the orchestra pit.
Ladies and gentlemen, we shall now sing.
Come on. Move along there, please. Come on, sir.
- No one's allowed to leave the theater.
- Can't a mate go out and have a drink?
- Ticket, please.
- I'm just looking for someone.
- Can I go through, please?
- Very good.
She's seen him. She's on her way down to the stalls.
May I borrow your opera glasses, please?
Excuse me. May I take your place, please?
What are you doing here?
I found him. He's up in that box.
You can't do anything about it. I've been to Scotland Yard.
Nothing has been stolen from the Air Ministry.
They're certain about it.
You heard those men say he got in there. There he is.
Shall we take him now or wait till the interval?
What you going to do?
There's nothing missing. There's an end to it.
Hear that tune?
That's that damn thing I couldn't get out of my head.
Now I know where I heard it before.
Of course, that music hall.
Annabella's...
Ladies and gentlemen... with your kind attention and permission...
I have now the honor to present to you... one of the most remarkable men in the world.
- That's the same man.
- Every day he commits to memory... 50 new facts, and remembers every one of them.
Facts from history, from geography... from newspapers, from scientific textbooks... millions and millions of them down to the smallest detail.
Test him, ladies and gentlemen. Ask him any question.
I've got it! Of course there are no papers missing.
All the information's inside Memory's head.
Mr. Memory.
- I still don't understand.
- Don't you see?
The details of that Air Ministry secret were borrowed, memorized by this man... and then replaced before anyone could find out.
That's why he's here: to take Memory out of the country after the show.
- Surely...
- Some gentlemen want to speak to you.
Question, please. Question, please.
- Where's the boat race?
- When did Florence Nightingale die?
- How tall is the Empire State Building?
- Are you Richard Hannay?
- There's something you should know.
- Come along quietly.
- That man on the stage...
- Don't cause any trouble...
- and spoil people's entertainment.
- What date did General Gordon die?
What are the 39 Steps?
Come on, answer up! What are the 39 Steps?
The 39 Steps is an organization of spies... collecting information on behalf of the foreign office of...
Keep your seats, please!
There is no need for alarm, no cause for alarm.
- I'm all right.
- Sure you are.
I don't want a chair. Let me rest here.
- I'm all right.
- Take it easy now.
- Take it easy.
- I'm all right.
Get the girls on straightaway!
The girls' introduction right away.
Mr. Memory, what was the secret formula... you were taking out of the country?
Would it be all right, me telling you, sir?
It was a big job to learn it... the biggest job I ever tackled...
- and I don't want to throw it all away.
- It'll be quite all right.
The first feature of the new engine is... its greatly increased ratio of compression... represented by R minus 1 over R to the power of gamma... where R represents the ratio of compression and gamma...
Seen in end elevation, the axis of the two lines of cylinders...
Angle of 65 degrees.
Dimensions of cylinders as follows...
This device renders the engine completely silent.
Am I right, sir?
Quite right, old chap.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
I'm glad it's off my mind, at last.
* My country, 'tis of thee
* Sweet land of liberty
* Of thee I sing
* Land where my fathers died
* Land of the pilgrim's pride *
* From ev'ry mountainside
* Let freedom ring *
And now, ladies and gentlemen
And members of the graduating class Of the Pacific Night Law School, Whom it has been my duty and pleasure
To guide along the paths of legal learning,
It is my high privilege and honor
To introduce to you the honorable Rufus Barnswell,
Who will address you on this momentous occasion.
The honorable Rufus Barnswell.
It is my privilege and honor to address you, gentlemen,
As you step toward the new careers
For which you've toiled and suffered and sacrificed.
Your fathers and mothers and your friends
May well be proud of your courage, your determination,
Your will to succeed.
Your applause must be for these young men,
Not for me,
For such young men as one whose history I happen to know
And who sits among the graduates
Because he had the courage
To lift himself above his environment,
To overcome handicaps
Which threatened to make him a criminal.
I reveal no secrets when I say to you
That this young man was the tough guy
Of a tough neighborhood.
At an age when most boys were in high school,
He was a child problem-
A problem to which his parents had no solution,
But they didn't need it.
This boy solved his own problem.
He realized his opportunities and duties
As an American citizen,
And with that realization came ambition,
Which has led him to toil at
The hardest manual labor by day
So that he might study
And arrive at the point in his career
At which he stands now.
That young man, ladies and gentlemen,
Sits there.
Johnny Ramirez.
Mrs. Ramirez, you should be very proud of your son.
I am, señor. I am very proud of my Juanito.
And excuse me, he was not a bad boy, Excellency.
Only one little bit wild, maybe sometimes.
Julius Pasquani.
Good luck.
Charlie Plonk.
Johnny Ramirez.
Ijuanito!
Ijuanito!
Ihijo!
Ihijo!
Happy, Johnny?
You bet, father.
Oh, Johnny, I think you going to be the best one.
Ah, she's the best of all.
That really belongs to you, mamacita.
If it wasn't for you-
Oh, no, Johnny mio.
And I guess you wouldn't let him get away with that crack
About me being tough.
But señor judge, she did not understand you.
And the señor police, she never understood me either, huh?
Juanito, it is not nice
To make a fuss of your mother!
Oh.
Behave.
Oh, mamacita!
Atencion.
Atencion.
A toast to you, mi muchacho.
A toast to Johnny, no?
Isi!
Isi!
Success, long life, and happiness
To a young lawyer.
Iviva!
Iviva!
Gracias.
Gracias.
No, Johnny.
With wine.
Nix, Alberto.
You know I ain't drinking.
You don't used to be that way.
Well, I didn't used to be a lawyer.
That stuff got me into more trouble.
Well, if you can't handle your liquor.
I can handle it, all right - By letting it alone,
And that's just what I'm doing.
Hey, hey, hey!
Johnny, I think you going to make a speech.
Well, everybody, thanks.
All I got to say is this.
There was a lot of talk at graduation today
About hard work and study.
Sure, it was tough,
But look at Abraham Lincoln.
He worked hard, didn't he?
And he studied nights, too, didn't he?
You bet.
All right, I done - I did, I mean, like Lincoln,
And I'm going to keep on being like Lincoln.
No, Johnny!
Hmm?
What's that?
Not with whiskers.
Not with what?
Whiskers. I look in those book,
And señor Lincoln has the whiskers.
Now, please, Juanito, no.
All right, mamacita.
No whiskers.
No whiskers.
I promise.
It's like the judge said,
"This is a land of opportunity. "
In America, a man can lift himself up by his bootstraps.
All he needs is strength and a pair of boots,
And I got them.
I'm quitting my job at the service station.
I'm going to open my law office.
I'm going to keep on working hard,
And someday, I can be judge of the supreme court,
And I'm going to do it.
Yay!
He was a great man, mamacita.
Only not so great like will someday be my Johnny.
Yeah, but none of those whiskers, huh?
No.
Juanito, you have promised me.
All right.
No whiskers.
No whiskers.
If I only had some law books to put in here.
What for you need law books, Juanito?
You are a lawyer now.
Sure. I just want them for looks.
Juanito!
¿Que?
Juanito.
Come here.
It is good you have it, no?
"J. Farada Ramirez. "
Mi Juanito.
"Attorney at law. "
Mi Juanito.
Oh, ma.
Ma, that's-
Aw, gee, that's swell.
Mama mia.
Aw, gee.
"J. Farada Ramirez, attorney at law. "
Oh, "J." - Ma.
Look.
There you are. "J. Farada Ramirez, attorney at law. "
Mamacita... but where did you get the money?
Be a good boy and mind my own business.
Your wedding ring.
I'll make it up to you, mamacita.
Someday I'll be the biggest lawyer in Los Angeles,
And I'll buy you diamonds and sealskin coat
And rings on every finger.
Oh, Juanito, could it be a Persian lamb coat?
Sealskin is kind of old-fashioned.
Sure, mamacita.
Any kind of coat you want.
Juanito.
My poor Juanito.
But don't you understand, Jose, compadre?
Until the court fees are paid.
I thought for an old amigo... but listen, Jose.
I don't get the fees.
I'd be glad to do the work for nothing,
But the fees must be paid in court.
The judge get a salary?
Sure, he does.
And why I must pay the court
Because someone tried to cheat me?
Let me explain again.
Now listen, Jose.
When you get the money,
You come back, and we start action.
You understand now, don't you?
I don't get the money,
The judge doesn't get the money.
The state gets the money.
Then I'll pay the money.
Buenos dias, padre.
Buenos dias, señores.
Adios, Jose.
Adios, padre.
Adios, Jose.
It goes slowly, hijo mio.
It doesn't go at all.
But I hear you have many clients.
Plenty clients.
No fees.
I've collected just $2.00 in the last month.
Yet there must be a greater satisfaction than mere money
In helping your own people.
If I only could.
It isn't the money.
I'm used to doing without that,
But I'm not getting anywhere.
They're all petty cases
Before the small-claim courts,
Justices of the Peace.
When a case amounts to something,
The poor client hasn't got money enough
To fight it,
And I don't get a chance to show what I can do.
At least a guy's got that coming, hasn't he?
Don't grow impatient, my son.
Your chance will come.
Remember - Patience is one of the virtues of our people.
Sometimes it's hard
To tell the difference, isn't it,
Between patience and just giving up.
You must not grow bitter, Juanito.
Anyway, I'm not giving up.
I'll get a chance someday.
I'll get a break someday,
And when I do, so help me, padre,
Nothing's going to stop me.
Johnny.
Juanito.
Juanito!
Yes, Manuel?
You got to help me, please. I got much trouble.
Well, who ain't?
What's it this time, Manuel?
No.
My automobile - She's no wish to go.
Do you want me to sue the old heap or get an injunction?
No, no, Johnny.
You help me, please.
If the automobile is no wish to start,
I can't go into market and get my vegetables.
I can't deliver them,
And, Johnny, I'm going to starve, I'm sure.
I'm supposed to be a lawyer, not a mechanic anymore,
Which is probably my mistake.
Anyway, I'm coming right down.
We'll take a look at the menace to the traffic.
Come along, padre.
If she won't listen to legal arguments,
We may have to try prayer.
There we are.
I think that'll do it.
Get behind the wheel, padre.
We'll wind her up.
All right, Juanito.
Give her the gas, padre.
Ibueno!
There we are.
We certainly won that case, didn't we?
Thank you too much, Johnny.
You know, Johnny,
This automobile, she and we,
We got many years.
Someday, she don't start at all,
And Manuel stop.
You know, I think I die.
Huh, considering my clients,
I hope my law business runs as long as this truck does. Yay! Well, good night, Carlos.
Good night, miss Elwell, Mr. Manville.
I hope you had a pleasant evening.
I did if I feel as well in the morning as I do now.
Shall I say whoopee?
You did yourself proud, Carlos.
Gracias, señor.
We'll see you soon, won't we?
Hmm.
And how's your health, sweet lady?
I feel glorious. Having fun.
We do manage to have a lot of laughs together, don't we?
Don't we just?
Whoo!
Cactus.
You know, I've suddenly become
Quite sentimental about you.
That's the first symptom of a very bad hangover,
No.
This is not Mexican wine talking.
I really mean it.
Let's us get married, Dale.
Brook, darling, I made up my mind
Never to marry anybody
At half past 3:00 in the morning
On the sidewalk of a Mexican street.
Oh, now, come on.
Let's talk this over calmly and reasonably.
Refuse to argue with you. You're too good a lawyer.
Why shouldn't you marry me?
Now I'll ask one.
Why should I?
There's every reason in the world you should.
I'm a very admirable fella.
Who speaks very well of himself.
Pull in your ears, my lad. We're off to the races.
Look out!
Oh.
Oh.
Miss Dale Elwell, huh?
Si.
And you say you were coming from the market, eh?
Si, Johnny, I just going on work.
Just going on to work?
I see.
Oh, Johnny, what I going to do? My poor automobile.
First, I'm going to have a doctor look at you.
No.
It don't make no difference about me, Johnny.
You remember I told you-
Automobile won't go, old Manuel won't go.
Don't you worry.
I'll see that you get justice.
Si.
Johnny, and you think
You are going make them fix it real good?
If I can't, I've wasted five years studying law.
Gracias. Gracias al cielo.
Mrs. Ramirez, your favorite son
Is going to court today
To fight his first real case and win it.
Be careful, Juanito.
They are very rich.
They'll be poorer by the price of a truck
Before I'm through with them.
It's my first chance, mamacita,
To show what I can do, and boy, will I show them!
You going to make them fix it pretty good?
Fix nothing.
We're going to get you a new one.
Oh, I don't know.
That old automobile, she's pretty good.
You just wait, compadre.
If I don't win today,
You got the rottenest lawyer in town.
No.
I got the best lawyer in the whole world-
Even Mexico City.
And what kind of fur coat
Was it you wanted, Mrs. Ramirez?
Don't you never mind about fur coat.
It is too hot to think about even.
* porque no tienes, porque le falta *
Manuel.
¿Si?
How can I win this case without you?
Come on.
I going, too. Adios.
Adios.
Please, holy mother,
Make it for my Juanito to win his case.
Many times I ask you to help him,
But this time, it would break his heart.
Help him, blessed Mary.
I don't want a fur coat.
I only want him to win.
Your honor.
After telling the plain facts about this case,
I feel it is my duty,
Not only to my client,
But to the court,
To make just one more point.
I found out that the defendant
Carried no insurance on her machine.
She's had so many accidents
That no insurance company will accept her as a risk.
I object, your honor.
Objection sustained.
What?
Can't I-
Mr. Ramirez, former charges against the defendant,
However well-Founded,
Can form no part of the present hearing.
Proceed, please.
O.K., your honor.
Then I'll move on to another point.
It is almost sure that at the time of this accident,
The defendant had been drinking-
Was kind of drunk.
I object.
The allegation so presumptuously advanced
By my, uh, learned opponent,
Is no part of the complaint.
What is more, there are no witnesses to testify
To the condition of my client.
Objection sustained.
But, your honor, I'm only trying to prove-
The court realizes what counsel is trying to do.
The counsel should realize that
This court is not a law school
And that he should not come before it
Without proper preparation of his case.
How can I present my case when he keeps on objecting?
I object.
Is that your way of being a lawyer-
Squawking "I object" like a parrot?
I object, if your honor please.
Counsel's remarks about my failings
Are incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial.
Objection sustained.
Don't you want to hear the truth?
Don't you want to see justice done?
This poor old man's truck was wrecked by a drunk driver.
His living has been taken away by a spoiled dame
Who thinks she can get away with murder
Because her old man's rich.
What's more important to this court-
A lot of legal technicalities or the truth?
This court is interested in the truth,
But allow me to point out, sir,
That you, in failing to prepare your case properly,
Have failed in your duty to your client.
Not only that, but you have been in contempt of court,
For which I fine you the sum of 50-
No, I'd better make it $25.
I haven't got $25.
I'd like to recommend, your honor,
That the fine be suspended.
Fine suspended on recommendation of the attorney for the defense,
And the court dismisses the case before it
Because of insufficient evidence.
Court is adjourned.
Well, that's that. You're a free woman again,
And you can thank your lucky stars for a good lawyer
And a bad one.
J
- Johnny, you didn't make them fix my automobile.
Why-Why, Johnny?
What do you want?
Well, perhaps you won't believe it,
But I'd like to help your client get his truck fixed.
We don't want your pity.
Oh, that's not it.
You convinced me, even if the judge was stubborn,
So please let me.
Aw, please.
Well, that's swell of you to-
After I couldn't make you do it.
O.K.
Don't be a fool, Dale!
By giving him money, you admit responsibility,
And he can still bring criminal charges.
Would you?
Of course not.
Promise?
I promise.
Nonsense.
As your attorney, I forbid it.
It's the same as an admission of guilt!
But he won't bring charges.
Well, that's what you think.
But he just promised.
What good is a promise from a cheap shyster?
He'll be blackmailing you-
Brook!
No. No, no, Juanito.
No pelees. No pelees, Johnny.
All right, Ramirez.
But this is the last time you'll appear in court
Except as a defendant.
I implied in court that you were not a good lawyer.
I say now that you're no lawyer at all.
If you knew any law, which you don't,
You'd still be mentally unfit to practice.
You ain't bawling me out because I smacked that big windbag.
You don't want a guy like me who comes from where I do to get a break.
It isn't where you come from, Ramirez.
It isn't a question of nationality or creed.
It's you.
You're a ruffian at heart-
Brutal, cheap, bad-Tempered,
And you'd be that in any country in the world.
Unable to hold your own
In a match of professional intelligence,
You resort to brute force.
Is that all?
That's all, except that
As a result of your stupid performance today,
I think that your legal career is just about ended.
You're trying to throw a scare into me, huh?
Not at all. I'm merely trying to inform you
That Mr. Manville happens to be
On the grievance committee of the bar association.
Why, you
- You don't think he'd-
He'd try and get me disbarred, do you, your honor?
I'm not a mind reader, Ramirez.
All I know is that if I were an attorney
Opposed to you
And had won my case because you had prepared your case badly,
And after the trial, you had assaulted me,
I certainly would do everything in my power
To have you disbarred.
But, uh, that
- The grievance committee
Will ask your opinion before they do anything,
Won't they, your honor?
Undoubtedly. I'll have to tell them the truth.
Well, I-I admit I sort of lost my temper-
The kindest thing I can do
Is be brutally frank with you, Ramirez.
In my humble opinion, you are not a proper person
To practice law in this community.
But, judge, listen, please.
All I did was lose my temper.
It won't happen again, I...
I studied for five years.
I worked day and night like a dog.
Please, give me another chance.
Not-Not so much for-
You see, my mother, she-
She will-
Please, judge.
Don't you understand?
I'm sorry, Ramirez.
Disbarred, huh?
Sure. Disbarred,
You think that's the way to face her?
Well, I had to do something to keep from thinking.
I'm sorry for you, Johnny.
Really sorry.
Well, I guess I made a pretty slick job
Of messing up my career.
To find oneself - That is to find real contentment.
You'll understand this, my son,
When you're older
- As old as I am.
But I'm not old!
Forgive me, padre,
But life is just starting for me.
I have a right to get ahead.
Perhaps you seek to get ahead
In the wrong direction.
You mean trying to be a lawyer.
I mean putting gain and glory
And false ambition
Above peace of spirit,
Trying to scale impossible heights
And forgetting the pleasant valley below.
I know, padre.
In a nice way, you're telling me to go back washing cars
Or digging ditches
Or being a farm laborer.
Surely there is no disgrace
In such occupations. Many have found happiness in them. Our fathers were of the soil.
They were good men.
And you're a good man, padre, a good man,
But I'm only a man-
Not even a gentleman, but a man-
And I'm going to take what I want from the world.
Patience, my son. Patience.
I've used patience!
For five years I was patient-
Starving, working, studying,
Trying to make a gentleman of myself.
For what?
So those white little mugs who call themselves gentlemen and aristocrats
Could make a fool out of me-
Break me, bar me out of court?
You may get another chance.
You bet you I will,
But I'll make the chance myself.
I'm going to climb.
I'm going to get power, money!
You seem so eager for money.
Why?
I'll tell you.
I lost my first law case
Because the other fellow had $30,000 worth of education,
And I had a five-And-Ten-Cent one.
They laughed at me in court
Because I didn't have money enough to pay my fine.
And he thought he could insult me,
Treat me like a servant,
Not because he was a gentleman and I wasn't,
But because his old man had a million-Dollar bankroll.
Don't you see, padre?
Money is what made the difference,
And I'm going to get money.
Juanito, please... don't go away.
It is the best thing for me, mamacita.
Don't try to stop me.
Here is your home.
Here is all the people who know you
And love you.
The people who love me are poor-
Dirt, like I am.
They can't give me what I need, mamacita,
And I won't be dirt anymore.
I'm getting out of this town.
Juanito mio.
Please, why?
I don't understand.
A guy's entitled to anything he can grab.
I have found that out,
And I'm for grabbing from now on.
Good-Bye, mamacita.
I will write you as soon as I can.
Juanito!
Good-Bye.
Juanito!
Good-Bye, mama.
Juanito!
Juanito!
Hijo mio.
Juanito.
Hop in, buddy. Where you going?
Where you going?
Way south.
Well, that's just where I'm going-Way south.
O.K., kid.
Boy, that cleans me.
Give me another stack of whites, Joe.
Sorry, sir. Mr. Ramirez told me not to sell you any more chips. Listen, I'm not taking any orders from Johnny Ramirez.
I am!
What do you want?
Say, a guy wants to pay with a check.
Is Mr. Ramirez in there?
Yeah.
He's in there with the boss.
I would not bother him now if I was you.
Whatever made you think that I wanted to sell this place?
It was sort of our idea.
You see, we thought we'd get together And form a little company, you know, To kind of take care of all the gambling in town.
Something like a syndicate.
So we decide, seeing you're a right guy,
To give you a run for your money- 35 grand.
That's smart dough, Charlie.
Ha ha ha!
No sale, boys.
Why, the slipper's worth three times that much.
Sure.
Tonight, Charlie,
But a month from now, you won't be able to get 10 gs for it.
Boys, I think I heard the boss say no.
You aren't going to let your strong-Arm manager
Talk for you, are you, Roark?
You heard him.
Sorry, boys.
On your way out,
Stop at the bar, and I'll buy you a drink.
What's the matter, Roark?
Can't you run your own business anymore?
That's the way I run my business, boys.
I always surround myself with smart fellas.
Keen, ain't he?
What did he do to get himself in?
Well, I'll tell you.
A little less than a year ago,
He blew in here looking down-And-Out
And also looking for a job.
He run into Butch Andrews.
You remember Butch - Used to be my bouncer?
Sure.
Plenty tough, too.
So Butch says to him,
"Just what kind of a job do you want,
You panhandling so-And-So?"
And Johnny says, "your job will do, you big windbag. "
He says that to Butch Andrews?
And Butch was more surprised than you are.
He let a roar out of him like a lion,
And he started after Johnny,
And that's the last thing Butch remembers, I guess,
Until he come to about an hour later,
Out of a job and with a busted beezer.
Ha ha ha!
So you hired Johnny because he flattened Butch.
Well, I like a winner, don't you?
Come on, let's get those drinks.
Give me $20 worth of chips.
I can lick any three men in this place.
It's lucky I feel good, and I want to fight
Because, boy, when I want to fight, I'm terrific!
Hello, Harry.
Oh, boy, am I having fun.
Everything's great.
I ought to punch somebody right square in the nose,
But I'm having so much fun.
You want to fight, but you're too happy.
Is that it?
You said it, boy.
I love everybody,
Even the people I don't like so much.
Oh, boy, am I having fun!
You really want fun?
Sure.
What about that fun?
Well, there's a swell place up the street
- The blue mill.
There's a dump!
Oh, boy!
Oh, boy, let's go!
Johnny, you're my pal, and I love you.
Well, that's great.
You just go up this street to the blue mill
And tell them you're a friend of mine.
You said it, boy.
You absolutely said it.
Put it there!
Hello, Johnny!
Oh, hello, Mrs. Roark.
You saw me. Why did you turn away?
Well, how have you been?
Come on, let's go inside.
Sure.
Charlie will be glad to see you.
Ha ha ha!
I don't need a lawyer anymore since he's working here.
You know, Johnny can draw up A better contract than a real lawyer. For instance, I've got a mortgage on a couple of houses here in town,
And I decides to foreclose and... why, baby, this is a surprise.
A pleasant one?
Sure. Boys, you know the wife-Marie.
Hi. How you doing?
Pardon us a minute. Now, listen, baby,
I don't like to have you coming into a joint like this.
Well, it's your joint, isn't it?
But even that don't make it a proper place for a lady.
I can't stick home all day and all night, too.
Got to have a little excitement.
Only fun I get is feeding the goldfish,
And they only eat once a day.
Oh, now, be a good kid and run along home, won't you?
I won't be out late.
Johnny, will you take the missus to her car, please?
Sure. A pleasure.
Well, all right, just as you say.
Be careful with your driving, honey.
And you be careful, too, lapping up the gravy.
About 2 more inches around your belt
And it will take a surveyor To measure you for a suit. Ha ha ha!
A surveyor!
Did you get that crack?
That's what I call a witty dame.
Ha ha ha!
She kills me!
Ha ha ha!
A surveyor!
$693.20.
$693.20, huh?
Almost 3 grand.
Not a bad take for a weeknight.
It could be better.
Never satisfied, eh?
It sure was my lucky day when you blew in here.
Your luck may change, Charlie.
I don't get you.
Well, Charlie,
Time for you and me to have a little talk, that's all.
Well, kid, if it's a matter of me
Paying you a few more bucks a week, I'd be glad to.
Chicken feed. I want some real dough.
You know I'm worth it.
Now, don't keel over when you hear this.
But I want an interest in this joint.
An interest!
Because I've got a few other propositions.
Now, kid, you're not going to quit me, are you?
Charlie, I like you.
I like you a lot... but business is business.
Well, I might be able to figure
Where I could cut you in on, say, 5% of... still chicken feed.
25%, or I'm through Saturday.
25%!
Now, listen, boy, I'm your friend.
Nobody's my friend... when I'm talking money.
25%!
Holy mackerel!
Say, let me talk it over with the wife first.
You bet, but I've got to have a yes or a no by Saturday.
You can have it tonight.
Come on and drive home with me.
Don't forget to tell the fellows to turn the lights off
When they're through working.
No use us making the electric light company rich.
Us?
Here, where are you going?
Well, I'm going to open the garage door for you.
You're going to open what door? You sit right here.
You see those two posts?
Yeah.
Keep your eye on the door when we drive between them.
Say, that must be magic or something.
How's it work?
Ha ha!
Come out here, and I'll show it to you.
You see this gadget here on the post?
There's an invisible ray that shines between the two posts
And hits an electric eye.
When we drive through, we break the ray, and the door operates.
Say, that must have set you back plenty to have those put in.
Sure, but there's nothing too good For the house my Marie lives in. Now watch the door close when we go through here.
Ha!
Has that got them?
When I get my 25%, I'm going to buy me one of them gadgets.
You could knock me down with a feather.
Kid, you're in.
Not a single squawk from the squawker.
Sure, I voted for you.
Well, say, much obliged.
Shake, partner.
I won't be a real partner till I'm getting 50%.
Ooh, did you ever see such a guy?
Watch out, Charlie.
You'll end up working for him.
Well, I wouldn't make him such a bad boss at that.
Ha ha ha!
You know, baby, I think this calls for a celebration.
How about me making us a big stack of flapjacks?
And, boy, can I make flapjacks!
Stop threatening and go and make us some.
Won't take me but a minute.
Ha ha ha!
Won't you sit down?
Thanks.
You're a big shot now, aren't you?
I'm getting there.
Don't you think of anything but pushing yourself ahead?
Anything wrong with that?
No.
I was just trying to make polite conversation.
Oh, thanks, I don't smoke much.
You don't drink... no bad habits at all?
None I can't handle.
Doc, you know, I never felt so miserable in my life.
Yeah? Well, just where do you feel bad?
Well, my stomach bothers me.
I get pains across my shoulders
And sometimes in my legs.
Uh-Huh. An old story to us in the dental profession-
Just what I thought.
Just what you thought what?
Teeth.
Ha ha ha!
Why, doc, what's teeth got to do with a stomachache?
My boy, teeth are the most important organ In the entire human body. Well, not mine.
I never been to a dentist in my life.
What?
Never to a dentist?
Never.
What? Wait a minute...
Uh-Huh, I was right. Come on.
Come on in, doc, and pour yourself a snort.
Marie's asleep, I guess.
Boy, will she be tickled when I tell her about this.
Now, tiptoe over and kick out one of the windows, will you?
Just to be sure I'm awake.
Oh, I'm sorry, dear, on the level,
But we're going to Los Angeles.
Who's we? Why, you and me. We're driving up there tonight, now.
Don't you want to go and have some fun?
I'm having fun right here on my ear.
Come on.
Doc carter's waiting.
What's doc carter got to do with it?
I forgot to tell you.
He's going to take out all of my teeth
And put in a new swell set of store teeth.
Is that your idea of fun for me?
No, thank you.
Oh, now, dear. I'm doing it just for you,
So I'll stay healthy and live longer for you.
Thanks too much, darling,
But if you think I'm going along, well, I'm not.
I thought you'd be tickled to take a little trip.
Honest.
I can hardly wait.
No, you and your dentist friend
Push off on your little moonlight excursion. Adios, amigo.
And don't come back with one of those sets that rattle.
Hello, Johnny.
Oh...
I decided not to go.
Well, Charlie gave me the key
And told me to put the money in the safe.
I thought he would.
That's why I decided not to go.
Well, go on with what you're doing.
Don't let me disturb you.
I won't.
Afraid of the dark, little boy?
The dark don't scare me,
And you don't scare me.
Listen, lady, I go for you.
I could go for you plenty... but Charlie-
Oh, so that's the angle.
Sure.
Charlie and me are partners.
We're doing swell.
What a chump I'd be to let a woman-
Any woman - Bust us up.
I think you must have an adding machine
Where your heart ought to be.
Maybe so... but as long as it keeps adding,
I don't kick.
Someday you're going to fall hard.
Not me.
I'm always moving too fast.
Good night, Mrs. Roark.
Ha ha!
All right, boys. Just get a close-up of these-
The swellest set of ivories
You ever saw off a piano keyboard-
And give a little hand to the guy that done it-
Painless carter!
Stand up and take a bow, boy.
Tell the folks on the level
- Did it hurt, Charlie?
Did it give you any pain?
Ha ha!
Only when I got the bill.
Ha ha ha!
Comical, huh, babe? Did you get that crack? Sure.
Also I got a headache.
Now, honey, don't feel that way.
Let's have some fun. It ain't every night
You can set up and celebrate a new set of teeth.
Is that a promise?
I feel like a new man.
And I liked the old one so much.
She liked the old one so much!
Ha ha!
Did you get that, folks?
Is that rich?
I'll tell the world I got a frau with a great sense of humor. Let's have another bucket of these old bubbles.
Hey, Johnny!
Here's a great boy!
Come on here, Johnny,
And dip your feet in some of this fizz water.
Why, thanks, but I got plenty to do moving round the crowd.
Want to look at my teeth again?
Later, later, when I have more time to enjoy them. All right, now, Johnny,
Send over a couple of gallons of champagne, will you?
It's on the house.
There's a swell kid, huh, baby?
Mm-Hmm... swell.
My little Marie... my little wife is the best wife I ever had.
My hero!
My lord and master!
I'd swap them both for a pack of cigarettes.
And that's what I promised to love, honor, and obey.
How's he doing?
Need you ask?
Charlie!
I'm sleepy, big boy.
Sleepy... that old wife...
All right, Charlie.
We go home and take a little snooze.
All right, Johnny. Guess I got a little plastered.
I guess you did.
Carlos!
Tell him where you want it poured. Thanks, Marie.
Good night.
All right, lift him.
Here we are.
Oh, boy, Johnny.
Whoo!
Ha ha ha!
You want me to drive? No, thanks. Not tonight.
I don't think you'll be able to handle him alone.
You better let me come along.
Oh, I can handle him all right.
My little wife here will take care Of old Charlie, all right. Now, Johnny, you fly away and don't annoy us.
Home, James, and don't spare the horses!
So long, Johnny.
The old wife will take care of old Charlie!
Aw, Charlie, stop.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on.
Oh, sit up, you fat, drunken pig!
Come on, get up and walk! Do you think I can carry you?
Oh, stay there.
Now, just one more question, please.
Where was Mr. Roark when you left the garage? Asleep in the back seat of the car.
Very drunk.
There are sufficient witness to that fact.
Naturally I couldn't lift such a heavy man out of the car.
He must have waked up, still drunk,
Turned on the motor, tried to get back in the car,
And-And then fallen.
Thank you, Mrs. Roark.
You need upset yourself no longer. The case is quite clear-
Accidental death by carbon monoxide gas.
I regret the necessity
Which forced me to question you.
You've been very kind, señor.
Please accept my deepest sympathy. If there is anything this department can do to help you,
Please command me.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Good-Bye.
Good-Bye.
We may consider the disposition of the estate settled.
Uh, except the insurance checks.
Of course.
You want them put through for collection?
No. The exchange is too high.
You better enter them in the states for deposit.
We'll wait until the rate goes down.
Splendid.
You are fortunate in having such a shrewd adviser.
I know that only too well.
At any rate, your affairs are in excellent shape.
I am certain your worries should never be financial,
Especially if you continue to have such excellent counsel. I'm sure of that.
Good-Bye.
Good-Bye.
Here we are.
I don't know what I'd have done without you, Johnny, During all this. Aw, forget it.
I'll be depending on you more.
I'm just a child when it comes to business. Well, I'll take care of everything.
I'll make you more money than Charlie ever thought of.
You will at that.
I'm going to sell the cafe
And build a new one, real elegant,
And charge fancy prices and get the best people-
Judges, bankers, aristocrats
- And soak them good.
That is, if it's
- If it's O.K. With you.
Anything you do is O.K. With me.
You know that, Johnny.
It's going to be the class of bordertown.
You know, they never really had a nice place Around this part of the country. Keep it.
Oh, I-I can use the bell.
Well, keep it anyway.
You'll be, uh... well, you'll be bringing money into the safe.
I can still use the bell.
...that won't do.
I'll never stand for that.
Mr. Ramirez, the lumber- The lumber!
Don't tell me it was the lumber that held you up.
I saw it on the ground two hours before you needed it.
Yes, sir, boss, but-
This job has got to move faster.
I don't care whether you do it with pick handles or bones.
You want me to kill my men?
I want this place to open three weeks from today!
If you can't sweat some work out of these guys,
I'll get a foreman that can.
All right, sir.
Come on, move them!
All right.
When will you have those built?
The lumber!
He's always got something to say.
What's that?
Wong, missy, Wong.
You crazy fool!
Stop creeping around the house.
I no creep. I walk the same all the time.
Oh, shut up!
Wong!
Yes, missy?
Wong, get my coat.
Wong!
Yes, missy?
Call me a taxi.
What's the matter?
All your automobile broke?
Mind your own business and call me a taxi! Yes.
Hello?
Gifaro?
This is Johnny Ramirez from the La Rueda. I'm coming up to Los Angeles tomorrow
To take a look at those materials
For the interior decorations. All right, good-Bye.
Say, Jim, I've been thinking.
You know, that bar is a little too big. I want it smaller.
It's architecturally perfect.
Oh, is that so?
Well, I want it smaller, so make it smaller.
Anything you say, Mr. Ramirez.
Oh, hello, Marie. Came to take a look at the place?
No.
To take a look at you.
Well, I've been meaning to come over to see you,
But I got to stick around here and push this job, you know.
Come on, I'll show you around.
No, no, let it go.
It's only a lot of lumber,
And it doesn't make much sense to me.
Listen, Johnny, how about taking me up to Los Angeles with you?
You know, just for the ride.
I'd like to, but there's a lot of work to be done, And you'd only be in my way.
I wasn't in your way when you needed money to build this place!
Stop squawking!
I'm going to make you more dough than you ever had before.
I don't care about the money, Johnny,
Just as long as I see you once in a while.
That house is giving me the willies.
What do you mean?
It's Charlie.
You know, I...
I sort of hear him walking around in the living room,
Like he used to when he couldn't sleep. Pretty soon he'll be writing you letters on the Ouija board.
I know it sounds silly, Johnny,
But just humor me for the night.
Take me home, will you?
You're talking like somebody's cracked grandmother. Please, Johnny.
All right, come on.
Johnny, stop, stop, will you?
What's the matter with you?
I said stop!
Are you crazy or something?
I'm sorry, Johnny. I just wanted to get out near the door.
I guess you were thinking of something else
And didn't hear me when I asked.
I thought for a minute you were just doing it to be mean.
Oh, forgive me, Johnny.
Uh, you drive the car in the garage,
And I'll have some coffee ready for when you come in.
Thank you very much.
Very nice you're here.
How do you do?
Glad you're here.
Boy, come here.
Take this plant and put it in my office on the desk.
And put water on it every morning.
It's from my mother.
Now, if you don't take care of it,
I don't take care of you.
Run along.
Oh, it's a marvelous orchestra, Johnny.
Oh, you should hear the cash register. Beautiful. Ha ha ha!
Well, well, George,
I certainly didn't expect you here tonight.
You certainly have a magnificent place, Mr. Ramirez.
Well, that's fine.
Now, don't take too much of my money away.
Congratulations, Johnny.
A great place for the sucker.
Sure. Glad you came.
Hey, Mr. Ramirez?
Yeah?
There is a party of six out in the foyer
That insist on having a table.
Well, they insist?
Tell them to come next week.
These people are real class, sir.
You sure?
I am positive,
And they demand to see the proprietor.
Oh, they demand?
Well, all right.
They can see the proprietor.
Isn't this an unusual place?
Yes, isn't it?
My evening is now complete-
A couple of old friends who forgot to make a reservation.
Don't tell me you're the proprietor.
It is the truth, nothing but the truth,
So help me.
I suppose we can get a table.
I suppose so... as a special favor to old friends.
Hererra... get me the best table in the house-
But the best-
And seat these people.
He will seat you.
This way, please.
I like personal service, savage.
Savage?
Aren't you afraid that I will pull the chair out From under you? I'll take a chance.
Come along, savage.
Hello? This La Rueda?
I want to speak to Johnny Ramirez.
This is Mrs. Roark.
I don't want to talk to the headwaiter.
I want to talk to Johnny.
One moment, please.
Mrs. Roark.
How do you do, Mrs. Roark?
This is Herrera.
Listen, you fathead, I want to talk to Johnny.
Put him on and stop stalling.
He's very busy, Mrs. Roark.
It may take a few minutes to locate him.
I'll have him call you back.
Like dancing?
With you?
Very much.
You dance this well with everybody?
Well, only with dame-
With ladies like you.
And you are really the first lady I've ever met.
Is that a compliment?
I don't insult customers.
Oh!
So I'm nothing but a customer to you. No, no.
You are sort of mascot.
The first time I saw you,
I took a poke at your boyfriend,
And that threw me into this business
Where I am making a lot of money.
And now you are here on the opening night of my place.
You must be good luck.
Better not lose track of me, then.
I won't.
I wonder where in the world Dale ever met him.
Oh, he sued her once.
Used to be a shyster lawyer in Los Angeles.
Frightful boor.
Well, he may be a boor,
But I'll take even money he'd never be a bore. He looks like something out of Carmen,
Doesn't he?
Uh-Huh. The bull.
Well, thanks for the dance, miss Elwell. Where are you going?
I've got to keep shop.
You can sit down a minute. Brook, get that chair.
Nobody's using it.
This is Mrs. Garner, miss martin,
Mr. Cole, Mr. Garner.
Johnny Ramirez.
Happy to know you.
There you are, Mr. Ramirez.
Thank you, uh, Mr. Mandillo.
I think your place Is perfectly exquisite, Mr. Ramirez. It will do.
Well, here's success.
To what?
To you, me, us, we, them... anything you like.
My pick?
Uh-Huh.
Well, here's to... us.
You've done admirably since I last saw you, Mr. Ramirez. Yes. The last time,
Although you weren't admiring me,
At least you were looking up to me.
You know, I was thinking
Of putting in a perfume shop here.
There is no duty.
What do you think of the idea?
I think it's grand.
Would you get me some chalon?
It's my favorite perfume.
Like it?
Well, there are only two kinds of smells to me-
Good and bad.
I think your headwaiter wants you.
Yes, Herrera?
Oh, yes.
Uh, I have something to attend.
You will excuse me, please?
You promise to come back and dance with me again?
Aren't you afraid you will make his honor jealous?
Not at all.
I will be back.
Very happy to have met you.
Out of what cave
Did you lure that fascinating brute? It's the prehistoric in me.
Amusing, isn't it?
That type of hood may not be so amusing if he gets serious.
Oh, I'd love to see him serious.
Well, if she keeps on going the way she is now,
You will.
I imagine he could be very dangerous.
But if he couldn't,
He'll be a great disappointment to me.
Hi-Ho, everybody.
Hello, Wong?
Yeah. I want to talk to Mrs. Roark.
Who is it?
Mr. Johnny said hello.
I thought you were going to call for me.
What do you mean keeping me waiting two hours?
Well, I...
I'm sorry, Marie,
But to tell you the truth,
I've been so busy, that... well, I just forgot.
Oh, you forgot, did you?
Well, who do you think you are?
What are you snooping around here for?
I suppose you think it's funny.
Well, he can't stand me up, see?
See?
See?
Get out of here!
As far as the eye can see-
Hundreds and hundreds of miles... nothing but desert.
It's heavenly.
I don't see how you could have accomplished so much
In such a short time.
Oh, just lucky.
Ah, no.
I imagine you get what you go after.
Most of the time.
And that makes you very happy?
That's right.
Your, uh, wife must be very proud of you.
No, she isn't. Why?
Because I'm not married.
What?
A successful, bright young man like you
Not grabbed off yet?
Quit riding me, will you?
I'm not riding you.
Aw, don't be so self-Conscious.
I've never been this way before.
You make me feel kind of dumb.
You're anything but dumb, Johnny. The trouble with you is
You work too hard all your life.
You don't know how to play.
I could learn.
Like me to teach you?
Sure I would. All right.
Now... now, don't be so tense.
It's a lovely night.
There's a moon, soft music... this is really romantic, my boy.
Drink it all in. Enjoy it.
Dale, you... you're swell.
Of course I am,
And we're going to have lots of fun together.
Are we?
Suits me.
See? You're improving already.
Now, don't you feel nice and calm?
No.
I'll tell you a little secret.
Neither do I.
Oh, we have company.
Hello, Johnny.
Miss Elwell, meet Mrs. Roark. How do you do, miss Elwell?
How do you do, Mrs. Roark?
Lovely patio, isn't it? So glad you like it.
Johnny and I have planned it for so long, that... well now it's really finished, we're just tickled to death.
Oh.
We.
Haven't you told her about us?
Johnny and I have been partners For some time now.
He does most of the work,
And I furnish most of the money.
That seems fair enough.
Yes, it's worked into a very pleasant partnership
In every way.
That reminds me. There's a very important business I'd like to talk to you right now.
Excuse us, will you?
I'm so sorry I interrupted your little chat.
Come on. Excuse us.
Of course.
What are you trying to do,
Make a sap out of me? You seem to be doing very well by yourself
Without any help from me. Sneaking down here, huh? Spying on me.
So I'm spying on you.
One look at her and you, and I got the whole setup.
What do you mean horning in... when I'm talking to a lady?
What thinks he's a gentleman. You're nothing but a barroom bouncer!
You'll always be one!
Marie...
I'm advising you to keep quiet.
If it wasn't for me,
You'd still be rolling drunks at the silver slipper.
I made you rich, put swell clothes on your back! Now just because you got your neck washed
You think you're a gentleman!
Nobody can make you that!
You're riffraff, and so am I!
You belong to me!
You're going to stay with me,
'Cause I'm holding on to you!
Why, I committed murder to get you! You committed what?
Sure! Sure!
Me!
I killed Charlie Roark to get you!
You... so that's what... why it... makes me sick even to look at you.
Marie, I'm warning you.
From now on, you stay away from this place... and stay away from me... or you will end up with Charlie.
Yes, sir?
I'd like to see miss Elwell.
She's not receiving, sir.
She's not what, sir?
Miss Elwell is not receiving anyone, sir.
Well, you tell her I'm here,
And see what she says, sir.
I don't think I know your name, sir.
Well, I don't know yours, either.
Mine's Ramirez-
John f.
Ramirez.
I'll see that miss Elwell receives your card, sir. I will help you.
Please be seated. Go on. Go on.
Run along. I'm right behind you.
It's the custom of the house
To announce all guests,
If you don't mind, sir.
Yes, Roberts?
There's a person to see you, miss.
Tell him to go away.
I did, miss, but he paid no attention.
Who is he? Um, a Mr. Ra-
Here's his card, miss.
Here.
Oh, Johnny Ramirez.
Tell him I won't be able to see him now.
Why not?
Because I haven't any clothes on,
Because I'm taking a sunbath,
Because I have a thousand things
To do this afternoon. What are you doing here anyway? Well, I just bought a swell new car
And came down here to take you for a ride.
Boy, upstairs and get miss Elwell some clothes. Oh, Johnny, I can't.
Now, either you say you'll go with me,
Or I'll tear this thing down and pull you out.
Now make up your mind.
Roberts, does Mr. Ramirez appear to be kidding?
No, miss.
Roberts, my clothes.
How do you do?
Say, boy, get my drink. It's in the car.
How do you do, ladies?
Well, here you are again.
Fine. I'm always glad to see you.
How do you do?
Now, how's everybody doing?
Winning?
That's fine.
Hello, Herrera.
How are you?
Fine, thank you, Mr. Ramirez.
How was the take last night?
700 over the night before.
Not bad.
If we don't run out of suckers
And the suckers don't run out of money,
We'll pay off the mortgage on the old homestead.
What are you doing here? Just looking after my interests.
I thought I told you to stay away from me. Somebody has to stay here
While you play Casanova in Los Angeles.
You can stay here some more because I'm going back.
You're going to go up there to see her?
What about it?
Well, I...
I hope you enjoyed yourself. You bet I did.
I had the best time of my life.
And as soon as I sign this payroll,
I'm going back to have a better time.
She's taking me to a house party with her,
And after that, we're going to be engaged.
Well... well, as long as that's the way it is,
I might just as well be a good sport about it. Best of luck.
Thanks.
You don't believe me, do you, Johnny?
No, I don't. Well, it's the truth, Johnny.
I want to see you happy.
I want to see you get places.
Yeah.
I've got to hurry and pack my golf clothes and dress suit.
See you later.
Yes, Johnny...
I'll be seeing you.
Are you sure of that, Mrs. Roark?
Yes, he made me kill him.
He said he'd kill me if I didn't.
I was afraid of him. I had to do it.
Johnny wanted the money I could get.
Oh!
Just a moment.
Inspector, will you issue a warrant For the arrest of Johnny Ramirez? Get him and bring him here right away.
In other words, you are trying to tell me
You were coerced, forced by Johnny Ramirez, Into murdering Charlie Roark?
Yes, that's it.
Hmm.
I'm going to dictate for your signature
The confession you have just made to me, Mrs. Roark. Kindly correct me when I'm wrong.
"I, Marie Roark...
Did in effect of Johnny Ramirez... "
Hello, Louis!
How are you, Francisco?
Could I talk to you
For a minute, Mr. Ramirez?
Not now. I'm in a hurry. Later.
I'm awfully sorry, sir, but- But! But!
What's the matter?
You clocked me doing 70 miles an hour coming down?
All right. Give me the ticket and hurry up. No.
That's not it, Mr. Ramirez.
We have a warrant for your arrest.
What are you talking about? A warrant for my arrest for what?
Murder.
¿Comida? No. No quiero.
Never mind, Guillermo.
I'm getting my food sent over from the La Rueda.
Muy bien.
Comida, muchacho.
Jorges? Guillermo?
Guillermo?
¿Si, señor?
Mail this letter for me, will you?
You got visitors.
Who?
A lady
- Young, beautiful?
All I know is you got visitors.
Abre la puerta.
¡Madre mia!
Juanito. tell me.
No, padre. I didn't.
No, padre. He no do it.
Sometimes he's bad,
But never my Juanito lie.
And furthermore, not a natural crime
Prompted by overwrought emotions,
But a hideous crime of murder for gain-
The most vicious, contemptible act
That man can commit against society.
And now, your honor and gentlemen of the jury,
The prosecution will prove that Ramirez,
By reason of duress and threats
Employed the wife of the murdered man
As ruthless as ever a man employed a dagger or a gun
To commit for profit
A brutal, cold-Blooded, preconceived murder!
And now with your honor's permission,
I will call my first witness, Marie Roark.
Ahem.
Raise your right hand, please.
Your right hand, Mrs. Roark.
Do you swear on your solemn oath before god
To give complete and honest testimony
To the utmost of your remembrance?
Do you?
I do.
Be seated, please.
State your name, please.
M
- Marie.
Marie Roark.
A little louder, please.
Marie Roark.
You were, at the time of his death,
The legal wife of Charles Roark?
Yes.
How long before the death of Charles Roark
Were you acquainted with the defendant Johnny Ramirez?
Answer the question, please.
I ask, Mrs. Roark,
How long before your husband's death
Were you acquainted with the defendant Johnny Ramirez?
He had so much to live for.
He was fat. He's still fat.
I can see him.
I can see him. Johnny wants me to see him.
He told Wong everything
At night when I'm asleep.
Wong would never have known.
That's why Wong let me be-
Mrs. Roark-
Yes!
Yes!
Mrs. Roark.
I'm Charlie Roark's wife. That's me.
Remove the witness immediately.
Yes!
Charlie Roark's wife.
That's me.
Order!
Order in the court!
Eduardo!
Your honor, I move to dismiss this case
On the grounds that the sole witness For the prosecution Is obviously insane.
Yes, Mr. Ramirez?
Now that you got my name memorized,
Go in and tell it to miss Elwell.
I'm sorry, sir.
Miss Elwell isn't in. I'm sorry, too, sir, but I don't believe you.
Now, melt yourself down, And go in and tell her I'm here.
Miss Elwell is just going out, sir.
Yeah, and I'm just going in.
Johnny Ramirez, no doubt.
Boy, you look swell!
Johnny, I'm so glad to see you.
They gave you a pretty bad time, didn't they?
Nah. The only tough thing about it
Was I couldn't keep my date with you.
I wanted to come to the trial
To lend my, uh, moral support,
But the family would have made it awfully messy.
That's all right. I understand.
Just forget it.
I brought you something.
Thank you!
What a beautiful corsage!
Corsage, my hat. That's a genuine orchid.
Now pin it on you, and let's get going.
Let's get going?
You and me are having dinner.
I'm sorry. I can't. I was just leaving.
Well, sure, with me.
No, really I can't.
I was just on my way to a dinner party.
Late at that. The family already left.
Horn me in. We'll sneak out early.
No, I couldn't do that.
It's one of those very stiff formal affairs-
Older people, friends of the family.
Tomorrow night, huh?
I was hoping to see you
And talk an ear off you tonight.
I promise to save you my very best ear.
I've got to run now.
Let me take you.
No, Johnny. It's too far.
It's in Bel Air, beyond Beverly Hills.
Fine. The further, the better.
O.K.
A genuine orchid.
Is this all the fast this Model T will go?
With you in it, yeah.
But, Johnny, I'm 45 minutes late already.
But, Dale, you're going to be later.
What now?
I want to talk to you.
My mother always told me to stay out of parked cars,
Especially when I was keeping her waiting for dinner.
I'm going to hail a taxi.
Aw, now, Dale... wait a minute.
Listen.
Just a minute. Please.
Dale...
I just want to tell you something.
I can't keep it any longer.
Johnny, I'm not kidding.
I must get to that dinner party. I know.
I'll take you, But just listen what I've got to say first.
It's more important than a dinner party.
All right. What?
Well, I...
I love you.
Johnny!
The first time I saw you in court,
I wouldn't have had the right to say it.
I was busted. I didn't amount to nothing.
Now I've got dough, and lots of it,
And plans to make more. I'm somebody.
All the work and everything was worth it
Just to be able to tell you this.
That's a very nice compliment.
You're class, real class-
Something a guy can love and look up to and respect,
And I do, Dale.
I want to...
I want to marry you.
Oh, but, Johnny, you're being romantic,
And that's out of character.
Now, listen, now, I'm serious.
But you can't be.
Marriage isn't for us, not even to talk about.
Why, it's for me to talk about.
I love you.
I'm asking you to marry me.
But that's out of the question.
You must understand that, Johnny.
No, I don't understand.
Why?
Well... because... because you belong to a different tribe, savage.
A different tribe?
You mean...
I mean, there's such a thing as equality.
Now please don't be annoying! Equality?
Why didn't you say that
The first time I kissed you?
You treated me plenty like an equal
The night we went for a ride.
You made a play for me.
Because I thought you were decent and swell,
I believed it meant you loved me!
You're hurting me!
Hurting you?
You can't feel nothing
Compared to the way you're hurting me!
You think you can wash yourself up
By saying you're better than other people.
I don't stand for that!
Let go, you filthy brute!
Brute!
Savage!
I'll show you!
Dale, come back here!
Come back here!
Look out!
No, gentlemen, the price is $250,000.
Nope. 225 is as high as we'll go, Mr. Chase.
Get Ramirez on the phone.
Tell him not to be a chump.
We're offering cash on the line.
My client insists that the price is 250,000.
You know Ramirez.
Either you want to buy the La Rueda,
Or you don't.
All right, then. It's a deal.
Well, Ramirez is worth 250,000 more in cash.
You gentlemen have made a smart move.
Say, Mr. Chase... it's none of my business,
But just why is Johnny selling
A gold mine like La Rueda?
Well, I...
I understand he wants the money
To help endow a law school.
That guy giving anything to anybody?
I'm just telling you what he told me.
And I detest all my sins
Because I dread the loss of heaven
And the pains of hell.
But most of all, because they offend thee, my god.
We're all good and deserving of thy love.
I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace,
To confess my sins and do penance
And to amend my life.
Go, my boy, and pray... for me.
Thank you, padre.
Well, Juanito, where to now?
Back where I belong, padre... with my own people.
Gentlemen, 1949 marks the 25th anniversary of the FBI as it exists today.
Like many another success story, this one had humble beginnings.
The first G-men worked under staggering disadvantages.
Do you realize that not many years ago, a fleeing kidnapper or bank robber could take one step across a state line and thumb his nose at us?
Often when we made an arrest we had to walk into a rain of hoodlum machine-gun fire though we were forbidden by law to carry a revolver.
But, gentlemen, the bureau did have as weapons truth, drive and vitality.
Even before the government armed us with guns and laws G- men became a dreaded underworld whisper.
I'm going to take you back to those days and show you a motion picture about a man named "Brick" Davis.
It's the daddy of all FBI pictures.
It's the first one that called us G-men.
The cars are old, you won't see women wearing the new look but you will see something that the bureau has never forgotten.
That while times change and habits change and styles change one thing is constant:
The man who want to get more out of life than he puts into it the hoodlum he's the same today as he was then.
He is still a public enemy.
All right, Vince.
Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you must know what justice can mean to a man who is defenseless because he is poor.
How would you feel if a huge corporation bulldozed you into selling your life's work an invention that has made them millions, and selling it for what?
A paltry $5000.
I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to look upon my client.
A man who has stood silently at a workbench for years planning, working, striving to create...
- Are you Davis?
- Yeah, come in.
Glad to meet you. My name is Joseph Kratz.
- Oh, yes. Sixth Ward.
- Oh, you know me, eh?
- Heard of you. Sit down.
- Thanks.
Got a good case for you, Davis. One that'll make you a lot of friends if you take it.
That's fine. What do you get out of it?
Me? Nothing. A friend of mine's in jail on a bum rap.
- I want you to defend him.
- What'd he do?
Why, he got drunk last night and beat up his old lady.
- His mother?
- Yeah.
- Nice fella.
- Well, you know how things like that are.
- They book him on assault and battery?
- They're gonna hook him on the Sullivan Act.
The sap was carrying a gun and beat her with the butt of it.
- Accidentally?
- Yeah, accidental.
But if she kicks off, he's up for murder.
Do you think I'd defend a guy like that?
- Why not?
- I'd rather beat his brains out.
I don't want the case, Kratz. It smells.
Now, wait a minute, just a minute, Davis, before you turn this down.
There are a lot of boys around my ward who'll play ball with you if you take it.
You don't want a lawyer, Kratz, you want a crook.
Take your dirty work to somebody else.
Now, don't pull any of that honest lawyer stuff on me.
"Big Shot" McKay didn't pick you out of the gutter and send you through college for nothing.
- Out.
- All right, all right.
When you change your mind, let me know.
Call me up. You'll never get anywhere playing shyster for that rat.
Hey!
- Eddie!
- Yeah, Eddie.
That's a swell way to treat a customer.
Just a greaseball!
Well, if it isn't old man Department of Justice himself.
- When'd you get here?
- Flew up this morning.
- Business?
- Yeah.
Sit down. Park yourself.
Well, well. What, no brass button, no badge? What is this?
Nobody has any time to polish them.
Too busy going around with a big badge frightening people.
What a lawyer. A year out of school, you're using the same argument.
And it's still good.
What's the use of going to law school if you're gonna throw it over and play cops and robbers.
If you had gone into practice, you'd be at the top now instead of flatfooting around.
Maybe so. But you sure look funny sitting behind a desk.
I suppose I have to entertain while you're here.
Not for a couple of days. I have an appointment with a chap named Durfee.
- After that, okay.
- That's swell.
I'll try to clean up most of my work. I think I can get a whole day off.
Are you getting much business?
Business is terrific. I have to throw half of it out.
What's the use of kidding, Brick?
Kidding?
You ought to keep your law books dusted off.
Old eagle-eye.
- Things are pretty tough, aren't they?
But only because I don't wanna be a shyster.
Which means blackmailing and ambulance chasing.
I've been in too many back alleys as a kid to wanna go back.
You've gotta have a West Side office to get decent business.
And I've got the East Side and...
The elevated.
I wish you were in the department. You'd make a good G-man.
- You starting that again?
- Yeah. What's more, you'd like it.
You'd be out seeing some action instead of sitting in a law office getting fat between the ears.
It's a great department, Brick. A great bunch of fellas.
When they tackle a job, they stick to it till it's finished and no fat-faced politician standing around telling them what to do.
I brought a department report along and an application I want you to read.
Now, think it over, mule. I have to shove along. I'll see you Thursday.
All right, Eddie, I'll be here.
- Well, I'm out.
- Same here.
- Let you two guys fight it out.
- Check.
Well, 200.
- Two more.
- You're called.
Ace full.
The guy's right, the gardenia does bring him luck.
This keeps up, I'll believe it.
- Who is it?
- Durfee.
Hello, Leggett.
- Hello, fellas.
- Hello. What's eating you?
The heat's on me. Will you lend me some dough?
- Dough? You wouldn't try to rib us?
- No, on the level.
How about that counterfeit you been printing?
- I haven't got any.
- What?
A government guy tailing me for the post-office job wrecked the plant.
- I've gotta get across the state line.
- Tough break.
- Okay, Dan?
- Yeah.
- Let us know when you're light.
- Thanks.
- I'll pay you back, double. So long.
- Don't forget that.
- No, I won't.
- Deal me out.
It's a tough break.
He ought to get himself an arsenal and stick around.
Why, those government guys don't even carry rods.
You're under arrest, Durfee.
Kill the lights.
Give me a reacher.
- What's the matter?
- Copper's got him.
Louie.
- How are you, Mr. Davis?
- Is Mr. McKay in?
- He's in his office, sir.
- Thank you.
Yeah, come in.
Oh, hello, Brick.
- Busy, Mac?
- No, come on in.
Well, sit down.
- Have a cigar?
- No, thanks.
Where have you been keeping yourself?
I've been sticking pretty close to the office.
- Much business?
- No, no.
Well, come on, kid, spill it. What's on your chest?
- I wanna talk some things over with you.
- Go ahead, shoot.
Tell me, Mac, how much did you spend on me?
- I mean, education and everything?
- About 20 grand. Why?
That's an awful lot of dough.
Chicken feed when you like a guy.
Was that the only reason?
Well, maybe I wanted to see a kid that had the same start in life that I had make a real success.
Haven't had much success.
Nobody gets ahead fast when they play the game on the level.
- That's the way you want me to play it?
- That's the only way to play it.
I been in rackets all my life, Brick. They don't pay off. Except in dough.
Well, Mac, it looks like I'm gonna cross you.
- You wouldn't turn crook?
- No, no.
But I am giving up the law business. I've tried to make a go of it, but it's no use.
Guess I wasn't cut out to warm a desk chair.
Well, maybe that's right. What are you gonna do?
I've joined the Department of Justice.
They accepted my application yesterday.
How'd you happen to do this?
Buchanan.
I got you.
They want you in Washington.
Yeah, I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
That puts me on the other side of the fence from you.
That's where you ought to be.
But they're out to get you. You and everybody else in your racket.
If they assign me to go after you, I've gotta use everything I know.
You got to play ball with them, Brick.
Go to it.
Now, Mac...
You won't get me, Brick. I'm going to quit.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
But what about Collins and Leggett and all the rest? Will they let you quit?
They still take orders from me whether they know it or not.
- Hi, Louie.
- Gentlemen. Hi, boys.
Hi, Ruby.
Yeah, you can put them both on one.
- May I check your hat, sir?
- No, thanks.
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.
- Come on, hurry up.
- Okay.
- Are you ready, Jean?
- Okay.
- Hello, Brad.
- How are you, Louise?
Hello, baby, how are you?
- Busy. Ever think of knocking?
- I never knock.
It does save getting splinters in your knuckles.
- Someday someone's gonna knock you flat.
- What are you doing tonight?
- I think I've got a date.
- With me?
- Nope. Brick Davis.
- Oh, is he here?
Yes.
- See you sometime.
- So long, Mac.
Don't hit any foul balls.
I'll try not to.
How are you?
- I heard something about you, lawyer.
- You did? What?
- That you're gonna be a big G-man.
- That's right.
- You ought to be dumped in a ditch.
- Keep your tin badge in Washington.
If you stick your puss in our affairs, you'll get a bellyful of this. Now beat it.
You made up your mind about that plant in Brooklyn?
Yep. I'm gonna sell it.
- Sell it?
- What do you mean?
- I'm gonna retire.
- What's gonna happen to us?
That's your affair.
You can take over and keep going if you want to, but you'd be suckers.
- This game is washed up.
- Yeah, maybe.
We're not gonna let the Mob bust up. There are plenty of rackets we can move into.
Not for me. I'm selling out.
- What if we don't want you to sell out?
- I sell out anyway.
I've spent all the time I want to trying to keep you guys in line.
From now on, you can run things to suit yourself.
If they catch up with you, it's your grief. I'm selling out.
- Does that make sense to you guys?
- Yeah, that makes sense.
- Hello, stranger.
- Oh, how are you, Jean?
Well, I feel fine. I was beginning to think I had the measles the way you've been staying away.
- I've been awfully busy.
Yeah, I know. That's the way it always happens.
Mac puts my name up in lights, and the only person I wanna see gets tangled up.
Don't you get eye strain reading law books?
Yeah, that's why I'm giving it all up. I'm leaving for Washington tomorrow.
I just stopped in to see you.
- Got a law case down there?
- No, I'm closing the office.
I've joined the Department of Justice.
- Then you'll be staying there?
- Yeah, for a while anyway.
Well, that makes things different, doesn't it?
Yeah, a whole lot different.
You could almost call it a flying broad jump, couldn't you?
I just told Mac about it.
- What did he say?
- He thought it was a grand idea.
Well, I think it's swell, Brick, getting into work like that.
You'll like it a lot better than a law office.
Yeah, that's the way I feel about it. I've gotta get going.
- Sorry you can't see the show.
- Yeah, so am I, but you understand.
Yeah. Goodbyes are sort of silly, aren't they?
- Yeah.
- Well, we can send you a bulletproof vest for Christmas.
- Yeah. So long, kid.
Say, there's no rule that a G-man can't kiss an old friend goodbye, is there?
Get a comparison on those test bullets yet?
Just checking them.
You're out of luck, Jeff. They don't match.
- Which one killed Buchanan?
- The one on the left.
I'll tell the chief.
- Morning.
- Morning.
The rifle we found isn't the one. The slugs don't check.
The fingerprints on the handcuff match Durfee's.
Buchanan had him collared when he was killed.
Put that in your wire to the New York division.
- Report back here at 3:00.
- Yes, sir.
Let me go up to New York, chief. I'd like a crack at this case.
No, I'm sending Smith up. I need you here in charge of training these new men.
- More law-school graduates?
- Three of them.
Oh, have a heart, chief. Give this grief to somebody else. I've been doing it for a year.
I made a decent record in the field for nine years.
Do I have to spend the rest of my life combing these kids out of my hair?
You're familiar with the work. And there aren't enough old hands to go around.
I'm the one should be yelling, not you. We need those men. Lots of them.
I know. But why can't we get more guys with police experience?
Guys that know the underworld, not just how to spout law.
These kids have as much chance of pulling through a dangerous assignment as Buchanan had.
That depends on how well you train them, Jeff.
That's your assignment. Go to it.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Davis is here, Mr. Gregory. Yes, sir.
He says you're to report to Mr. McCord, the man who just left.
Thank you.
- Hello.
- Well, you look like you're not going to New York.
- I'm not going.
I'm gonna keep on pounding the ABC's of crime into the skulls of these babes-in-arms.
Law-school graduate. Law-school graduate. Law-school graduate.
Listen: Mr. James Davis, doctor of law, doctor of philosophy, Phi Beta Kappa.
Now, isn't that sweet?
- Phi Beta Kappa.
- What's yours, "Flatfooter Copper"?
Who said that? Who are you?
I'm Davis. But don't let that spoil your fun. Go right ahead.
So you're Mr. Davis.
- And you're McCord.
- That's right.
- And this is Mr. Farrell.
- Hiya.
- Hello.
- And we're not Phi Beta Kappas.
- No, I gathered that.
- A very funny remark.
Lay off him, Jeff. He seems to be all right.
Sure, a perfect legal specimen.
But I don't think I like you, Mr. Davis.
And I can't work up much of a sweat over that kisser of yours either.
However, my personal attitude will have no bearing on your advancement.
I think I'll take charge of your training personally.
There you go.
I don't want you to think I'm taking advantage of you in this but the first requirement is an excellent physical condition.
Second, to know how to take care of yourself in a fight.
I've noticed that you lawyers talk most of your fights in court.
Now, the first is the balance.
Keep your feet wide apart so that you won't be bowled over if somebody says "boo."
Like this.
So?
Very good. Now, the left lead.
Keep your right well up and guard my lead.
Well, keep it cocked. Keep it up there. Keep the right hand high.
That's very, very good. Now we'll trade rights.
You mean, like this.
Nice going, Brick.
Hey, he's a darn good lawyer.
- Yeah. How was that, better?
- That's fine, Davis. Fine.
Your leverages are practically the same as in wrestling.
- Hello, Jeff.
- Hi.
Jujitsu isn't hard to learn once you get used to the uses of the shifting balance.
Now, try those last two attacks I showed you.
Watch out for yourself. I'm gonna give you the works on defense.
- All right. Here we go.
- All right.
- I wasn't expecting that one.
- You'll get on to it.
- Now, try the second one.
- Second one?
Well I'd like to try that one again. Come ahead.
Gee, I'm sorry, Davis. I didn't mean to throw you off the mat.
Oh, that's all right.
Are you okay?
Listen, maybe you'd better call it a day and go and wash up.
- Yeah.
That's kind of a good idea.
Well thanks for the workout.
- Not at all.
Hey, that kid can take it, Jeff.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Very good.
Mr. Davis you're next.
The noise may frighten you, but we want you to get used to it.
In case they change the laws so that government agents can carry guns.
Keep a stiff wrist.
The idea is to look along the barrel and try and put the bullet somewhere near the dummies over there.
I see.
Like this?
That's it.
Would you mind reloading that? I get a bit frightened.
Where did you learn to shoot?
I used to be marble champion of the Bronx.
What's the..?
- I'm awfully sorry.
- You should be.
No, I... I really am. So sorry.
- Are you waiting for someone?
- Obviously.
- Perhaps I can help you.
- No, thank you.
You're very welcome.
Are you waiting to see somebody?
Oh, pardon me for staring. I'm studying character in faces and I find yours interesting.
- So it appears.
Chin type number two.
"Does not make friends easily and resents strangers."
Yeah, that's right.
"Eyes far apart indicates cruelty to animals.
The tendency of the skin to get purple with anger indicates high blood pressure...
What does it say about rifles and ammunition?
- "Most effective when used on offensive."
- Does it say how offensive?
Well, we... We all look at things differently.
Jeff!
Hello, Kay.
- How are you?
- Just fine.
- Have a good trip down?
- Wonderful.
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Same here. Where's Hugh?
- He went to look for you.
- He met you at the station?
- I wanted to come myself.
- I know. Hugh told me.
Where have you been keeping yourself?
I'm sorry to keep you waiting but this brother of yours jumps around like a grasshopper.
- Have you seen the apartment?
- I left my bags there. It's grand.
- Pretty good-looking for a graduate nurse.
- Oh, not bad.
And they advanced you to night supervisor?
I'm getting this vacation on full salary.
- Swell. You can buy our lunch. Come on.
- Well, I should say.
Extra! Federal bank truck robbed! Half a million dollars!
Read all about the big robbery! Two murdered by bank bandits!
Hop on these. They're the bullets that killed the bank truck guards.
Check them against all the gun-marking records.
Okay, Jeff.
Where did you get this?
From the right-hand front door of the car they did the shooting from.
Pull me the file on Twin Loops, B-6.
Fat chance those guards had.
Guy next to the driver had a shotgun and a rifle and two guys in the back blazing at them with machine guns.
Twin Loops, B-6.
- Were there any marks on that car?
- Not one.
We traced the license, but it was stolen. Oh, yes, there was one clue:
A mashed flower on the floor of the front seat, a gardenia.
A gardenia?
- Yes, a gardenia.
- On the side where the man with the shotgun was sitting?
- That's right, hawkshaw.
See if you have prints on Danny Leggett, a New York gangster. Please, a hunch.
They might check up with this one.
Find out if we got any prints on Danny Leggett, a New York gangster.
- Yes, let me have them.
- You're marvelous.
All you have to do is hear about a gardenia, and out of 4 million prints you pick the right one, just like that.
So nice to have you realize it.
Prints on Leggett. New York record.
Thanks, Joe. Well, we'll see how good you are.
It's a long shot.
Four million to one. Ought to be a cinch. I'm dying.
Almost too good to be true.
He's right, Jeff. Leggett's your man.
Don't you think you better run along and tell Gregory, Mr. McCord?
Wait a minute, Davis.
How do you know so much about this Leggett?
We were raised together on the East Side in the same neighborhood.
- An East Side mug with a gardenia?
- Yeah.
- What?
- He always wears one. It's a superstition.
- Did you find anything?
- I'll say I did.
This rifle bullet is the same as the one that killed Buchanan.
- Yeah?
- Positive check, same rifle.
That means Leggett. He used it in the bank robbery.
Yeah, but that's no proof he's the one who used it on Buchanan.
No, but I know how to get him and find out.
- Let me go to New York.
- Forget it. You haven't finished your course.
- But you can recommend me.
- Well, I'm not going to. You're not ready.
Then you won't do it because you don't like me. You never have.
But you're not man enough to say so. If Leggett killed Buchanan, I want him.
I'm going over your head, McCord.
I'm going to ask Gregory myself.
McCord is right, Davis, and personal differences have nothing to do with it.
We have definite rules governing procedure here, and we stick to them.
- Yes, sir.
- I wouldn't send you or any other new man.
Farrell has this assignment. You'll have your chance when you're ready for it.
That's all, Davis.
Thank you, sir.
I'm not going to assign you to New York.
That would tie you up in case Leggett gets across any state lines.
You'll be assigned to the district where you find him.
I want only one thing:
- Get him.
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.
- See you at the airport, Jeff.
- Right.
- Well, I hope you get him, Farrell.
- Thanks.
You wanted this assignment bad, didn't you?
Yeah. Buchanan and I were close friends.
I'll remember that.
You might keep an eye on the flower shops. Leggett buys a gardenia every day.
- Thanks, Davis.
- Oh, and watch that derby of his.
He doesn't wear a hard hat for nothing.
- I'll remember that too.
- Good luck.
- Well, how do you do, Miss McCord?
- Oh, it's you.
Yeah. My name's Davis.
So you're Mr. Davis.
- You've heard of me?
- My brother mentioned you.
- Oh, yes. We're good friends.
- Didn't sound like that to me.
You mustn't mind him, he's a great kidder. You know, you're looking better today.
- You've lost that purple angry look.
- I'm glad to hear it.
- I was worried about you.
- About me? Why?
Well, we can't discuss that here.
- Couldn't I see you this evening?
- No, I'm leaving for Chicago tonight.
Well, that's too bad.
Just what did you want to talk to me about?
Why, I might like to have a picture of you.
- Did you think I'd give you one?
- Wouldn't you?
- No.
- Well, I just thought I'd ask.
- Are you as nice to everybody you hate? - Yes.
And they don't get pictures.
Well, thanks for letting me have it.
- I said I wouldn't give you one.
- But you have.
Hey, Davis, telegram for you.
Oh, thanks.
- Mac!
- Brick, come on in.
Well, gee, I'm glad to see you.
- I'm glad to see you. - Come on.
Sit down.
What a surprise. Tell me, what are you doing here?
Me? I'm heading west.
"Joseph Lynch" and "heading west"? What..?
I didn't want anybody to connect you with me, get you in a jam.
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, how you getting along?
Fine, fine. I just finished my training course.
- Never mind about me, what are you doing?
- I'm in the hotel business.
- You, in the hotel business?
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
- I bought a summer place up in Wisconsin.
It's called Pinecrest. Fishing, tourists...
- And mosquitoes.
- Yeah, mosquitoes. All that kind of thing.
- Well, what about New York?
- I sold everything out. I'm gonna forget it.
- And you threw the Mob overboard?
- Yep.
Well, I'm still looking for Leggett.
- Wanna tell me anything?
- You wouldn't want me to, would you?
No. Forget it.
You know, I can't play ball with either side. I'm kind of sitting on top of the fence.
Swell place to spend a nice quiet life, but rather dull.
- Yeah.
- What about Jean?
I don't know. She kind of dropped out of sight after I closed the cabaret.
- I haven't seen her in months.
- I'd like to see her. A swell kid.
- Yeah.
- Board!
Well, that's me. Guess I've gotta shove off.
I just wanted to tell you, if you get out west, come look the place over.
- I'll give you a real blowout.
- Sold.
It's a date. I'm glad you let me know you were passing through.
I just wanted to check on how you're getting on.
- I'll see you sometime. - You bet you will.
I'll see to that.
- Bye, Mac.
- Goodbye.
- You send for me?
- Yes. Just making out a report on you.
Before I send it to Gregory, I want the right answers to some questions.
- Riding me again?
- If I am, it's for the last time.
You've been making a few slips, I've been checking up on you.
- What are you trying to get away with?
- Nothing.
Then why did you falsify your personal history in your entrance papers?
I didn't. There's not one false statement in those papers.
They've been checked and passed. You can't nail me on that, McCord.
I've told them everything.
Runaway from the orphanage, arrests for vagrancy and fighting, law school, all of it.
All but the one thing you knew would keep you out of here and I've just uncovered it.
You've been hooked up with a big bootleg outfit in New York.
The leader paid your way through law school, undercover.
Set you up in law business. A very smart way for a Mob to get a stool pigeon in the Department of Justice.
- That's a lie.
- The same Mob that Leggett's in.
No wonder you could tell us all you knew about him.
It didn't hurt McKay, and it got you in here solid.
McKay had absolutely nothing to do with my coming here.
And once more, I've never worked for him!
I haven't seen him or been in contact with him for months!
Well, until...
Go on.
Until you reported to him on the 3:45 train, drawing room A.
You've been under observation for a week, Davis.
Well, I guess that takes care of everything.
You can break me out of the service with that.
Yeah.
That seems to be what you want.
You've been riding me for a long time but I'll give you some straight answers.
- Go ahead.
- I'll tell you about McKay.
I was a gutter rat when he found me and would probably still be one if it hadn't been for him.
He gave me a chance to go straight, do the right thing. I took it.
But he's never asked anything of me.
- Why did you join the department?
- Because of Buchanan.
Buchanan was my friend. He was my roommate at college.
And I wanted to get the guy who killed him.
McCord, I studied law because I wanted to work for the law and for no other reason.
Now, I've taken an awful lot from you since I've been here and you're the last man I'd ask anything of unless it meant a great deal to me.
The service does.
Please don't kick me out.
- Thanks.
- Thanks, nothing!
Make one more fake pass, and out you go for good!
- You know the ropes around here, huh?
- Yeah, I made some contacts.
- Collins come out with you?
- No, he'll join us in about a month.
- Any of the rest of the Mob come out?
- Six of them.
They got a hideout in Kansas City.
- I got one here in case you need it.
- Probably will.
We figured on staying around for a while.
Thinking of opening up a bank. Maybe a couple of them.
- Nice country around here.
- Yeah, I was thinking that myself.
Calling all cars.
Attention, all cars.
Be on the lookout for a man identified as Leggett heading west on Highway 66.
You sure this is the place?
The second cabin. He buy gardenia from me...
Yeah, yeah, sure. I know all about that. Come on, boys.
- Tony, you stay here. All right.
- Yes, sir.
- Stick them up!
- Not this time, Leggett.
Come on, get up.
Move it.
Put your gun up, copper. You're not gonna get hurt.
I wish I could use it on you, I'd save the state a lot of money.
Come on, Leggett. Get into your coat.
Too bad you didn't have that on when it happened.
Who told you about that?
Oh, a friend of mine. Come on, get going.
- They've got Danny. - Wait a minute.
There's too many of them.
We'd better get the Mob. Go on, scram.
I don't know anything about it.
- You killed Buchanan.
- You're crazy.
You used the same gun to kill that bank guard.
Oh, save your breath.
You'll talk when you get inside that jail.
- You won't keep me in any jail.
- No? We'll see.
Yeah. We'll see.
- Paper!
- Tonight's final!
- Paper here! - Tonight's final!
- Hello, chief.
- How are you?
- Car ready, Al?
- We've got two of them.
Okay. Let's go.
Paper. Paper. Tonight's final.
Get readied up. They're here.
Come on, let's go.
Up, coppers, up!
Leggett! The car's across the street!
Scram!
The state police cannot combat these criminals.
Neither can city police.
The law prohibits them from pursuing criminals across the state line.
With the automobile and airplane these gangs can get from state to state in a few hours.
The Department of Justice is handicapped.
When Hugh Farrell died in that slaughter he didn't even have a gun to defend himself.
A federal agent is not permitted to have a gun.
He can't even make an arrest without first obtaining a local warrant.
Gentlemen, give us national laws with teeth in them covering the whole field of interstate crime.
Permit us to work to full effect with the state police agencies and these gangs will be wiped out.
What laws do you need most?
Make bank robbery and kidnapping federal crimes.
Make it a federal crime to kill a government agent or to flee across a state line to avoid arrest or to avoid testifying as a witness.
Arm your agents. And not just with revolvers.
If these gangsters wanna use machine guns then give your special agents machine guns, shotguns, tear gas.
Everything else. This is war!
Now, understand, I don't wanna make them a group of quick-trigger men but I do want the underworld to know that when a federal agent draws his gun he's ready and equipped to shoot to kill with the least possible waste of bullets.
I know how you feel about Hugh, Jeff, and I've decided to let you take over.
You're giving me his assignment?
I'm putting you in charge of the Chicago office.
This list is to be posted in all districts and not to come down until every name on it is accounted for.
More will be added. Take the plane. I'm assigning five agents to go with you.
- You pick your own men and let me know.
- Yes, sir.
Send Davis in. And tell Henderson to report here at once.
Yes, I wanna talk to you. You've been yelling for months for action.
We'll see how your nerves stand up under fire.
You're assigned to Chicago. Be at the airport at 4:00.
Now, go on home and get packed.
It's part of the money taken in that East Chicago bank robbery.
- How much did you get?
- Two $20 bills.
Their serial numbers check with the list you gave us.
- Who banked them?
- J.E. Blattner.
Here's the deposit slip and the address.
"J.E. Blattner, 43..."
- When did you get them?
- One last night. The other four days ago.
I didn't know it was hot dough, honest. I'm on the level.
- Never mind that, who gave them to you?
- I don't know him.
- What'd he look like?
- Oh, medium size.
Black hair. He's a swell dresser. That's all I know...
- Buys a flower every day?
- Yeah, a gardenia.
- He buys lots.
- All with $20 bills?
Yeah. He always carries a roll.
All right, that's all. Keep your mouth shut.
You bet. I don't wanna get tangled up with you G-guys.
- So long.
- So long.
Hold your fire!
I've been waiting for this.
Come on. On your feet.
On your feet.
Yeah.
He's taking a shower. Any message?
There ain't any shower there, copper.
- I'll bet that was Collins.
- Yeah? Get him out of here.
I can't help it.
Every time I see you, I wonder if it's gonna be the last.
Now, listen. There's no sense in you reading the papers and then coming down here all in an uproar.
I'm all right.
- I'll keep on being all right.
- That's what Hugh said.
- He never had a chance.
- I know.
But he didn't have a gun either.
Those guys don't like it now that we're able to give them a dose of their own medicine.
You should have seen the way Davis manhandled this Leggett.
- I'm not interested in Davis.
- Yeah, well, it was a sweet job.
- But don't tell him I said so.
- Don't worry, I won't.
I don't even wanna talk to him.
- You're beginning to like him, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.
And I wish you'd keep him away from the hospital too.
- Do you mean to say he's been up there?
- Yes, he has.
He said he wanted to look over the rooms in case he ever got sick.
Excuse me. There's a man here wants to see you.
- Says it's important.
- Who is it?
- He won't say.
- All right.
Wait outside, will you, Kay?
What do you want?
- Well, I got a message for you.
- All right, go ahead.
Do you guarantee not to arrest me?
Oh, that kind, eh? I promise you nothing.
What have you got to say?
The paper says youse guys is gonna take Leggett down to the state pen tomorrow keep him there till his trial, right?
- Yeah. That's right.
Well, Gerard says to tell you G-guys if you stick your nose out trying to take him to the pen there'll be another massacre.
- He said that, did he?
- Yeah.
Well, you go back and tell Gerard that I've decided to talk Leggett to the pen myself.
Tell him I'll leave here with him at 7:15 tomorrow morning.
I'll go to the station by car, take the 7:40 train and then a car to the prison.
And if he's looking for trouble, he can have it at any of those times and places.
Get out!
- You can't do that, Jeff. They'll kill you.
- Nonsense.
- You can't take chances like that.
- Forget it.
Think I'm gonna let that Mob get away with sending their orders into this office?
They're not playing with a bunch of helpless bank tellers.
The sooner they learn that, the better.
We're gonna make the word "government" poison to them if it's the last thing we do.
What does that matter to me? I... I can't lose you, Jeff.
You can I are alone, and I haven't got anybody.
There, there.
You're not going to lose me.
Oh, come on, sis. You don't know what this is all about.
You go back to your hospital and help take care of all those cromos with the mumps.
What's the matter?
It's Jeff. He can't go through with it. He'll get killed.
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
- Oh, please don't let him do it.
He's gonna try and take Leggett to prison alone. You can stop him. Please!
Now, you mustn't worry about that.
He'll do it beautifully.
Now, you keep your little head right there, and...
Get going.
Nice prison.
Too bad your Mob didn't keep their promise.
You won't live long, McCord.
Step on it, driver.
Sit tight, Leggett.
If they start something, remember, you get it first.
Watch that car.
Are they dumb enough to think they can get you here?
Get him inside.
Hello.
What's the idea of trailing me?
Just wanted to see if you could get here.
Any report from Division L?
Yeah, there's no trace of Collins or Gerard. It looks as though the Mob has disappeared.
- They've got a great hideout, wherever it is.
- I'll say they have.
Unless you fellas have been taking a vacation for two weeks.
You haven't had an attack of brilliance lately. Why don't you try guessing?
They're in that circle somewhere.
Only six states. We've got them cornered.
Cut out the wisecracks. What time did that..?
- Any luck?
- We found Collins' wife.
- Where is she?
- Outside. Wanna question her?
I'll say I do.
Bring her in, Bill.
Sit down.
- We located the apartment he rented.
- The boys have been drinking varnish.
- The landlady identifies her as Mrs. Grover.
- She's crazy.
She identifies her as Mrs. Grover. That's the name they've been using.
You're lucky that's all you heard.
You should hear her tell about the tenants in 106.
Cut out the funny stuff. Where's Collins?
- You frighten me.
- Answer the question.
I haven't the slightest idea. He's just a friend.
I dropped in and he wasn't there. These gentlemen were.
They looked at me and I looked at them. They invited me down here and here we are.
Now, are you happy? Or shall I tell you about my operation?
- Gonna keep on stalling, eh?
- You are so bright.
McCord, I'd like to speak to you for a moment.
We won't get anywhere that way. Let me have a few minutes alone with her.
- Why do you think you can get her to talk?
- I know her.
Come on out, guys.
No reason why old friends shouldn't shake hands.
Thanks for calling off the wolf.
Funny meeting this way, isn't it?
Yeah. Not even a floor show.
Tell me, why did you marry him?
Why not?
Oh, yeah, I know, but why Collins?
Brad's always been pretty swell to me. I've been happy.
Oh, now, come on, don't give me that.
- Let's stop the kidding.
- I'm not kidding.
All right.
When did you see him last?
You heard me tell them. A month ago.
- I didn't expect you to tell the truth.
- Then why ask me?
Because I can't understand protecting that guy.
You know what he is and what he's done.
You know that since he's been out here he's killed two officers in cold blood.
And you tell me you've been happy with him?
No, I'm not.
When I read that, I decided to quit. I'm not going back to him.
There, that's better.
When did you marry him?
A couple of months after the cabaret closed.
And you never told McKay?
He's one person I didn't want to know about it.
He'll probably learn it from Brad, though.
He'll learn it from Brad?
- Is Collins with McKay?
- No.
- He's hiding out at McKay's lodge!
- I never told you that!
- Brick! Brick, you can't!
- You wait there.
- Well?
- Collins is hiding at McKay's summer hotel in Pinecrest.
- Gerard and the rest are probably with him.
- I thought you said McKay quit.
- I did, but...
- Drake, pick seven more men.
Get guns for all of them. Martin, call the police at Pinecrest.
Ask them to have three cars waiting.
- Get a transport plane.
- Right.
I could go for this north woods stuff.
- It does something to you.
- You're telling me.
The idea of Mac trying to keep us out of here.
- Say, I thought you said he was a pal.
- Sure, he is. But he's a bad host.
Imagine him calling this poison good liquor.
He don't even like it himself.
Give us a speech, Mac, and tell the girls what a big shot you used to be.
Go on, talk!
You wouldn't like what I have to say.
Closed for the season. We'd better stop here.
There it is.
Get to the positions you were assigned on that map.
Davis, you watch the side door.
I've got 12:17. Five minutes will give you time to get around the back.
When we're ready to crash in, I'll fire two shots.
You fellas go through those windows and doors, and go fast. All right.
Come on, let's see if you can still stand on those heels.
Excuse us, will you, Mr. McKay?
Say, what's that?
- They've spotted us.
- No use waiting.
Come on! We gotta move!
We might as well quit. We're not hitting anything.
Keep that gun working! Keep them in the woods!
Give me noise! Give me lots of noise!
Come on.
- We can't make it this way!
- Side door's nearer to the cars.
Okay!
You've gotta help us out of here!
Shut up! Get upstairs and lay low. We gotta make a run for it.
Give them the tear gas.
Tear gas!
Gas!
Come on, we gotta make a break for the cars!
- Who's going out and take it first, you?
- No, none of us.
Come on, Big Shot. You're big enough to be a good shield.
Mac!
- Hello, Brick.
- Mac, I didn't know it was you.
It wasn't your fault.
You're okay, kid.
Funny, I was thinking about you the other day wondering when you were coming up for that...
Oh, Mac.
- Nice work tonight, Brick.
- Road between here and Chicago is blocked.
What's the idea?
I'm washed up.
I'll mail my resignation in to the Chicago office tomorrow.
Davis.
One time you told me I was the last guy you'd ever beg anything from unless it meant something to you.
- Yeah.
- Personally, that goes double with me.
But I'm talking to you now as the head of this division.
I don't wanna report you as the first guy that left this service before his job was finished.
That time it meant something to you to stay.
Now it means something to me to have you stay.
Oh, I know how you feel about McKay.
I'd feel the same way in your spot, but you didn't kill him.
Those rats could have left him inside.
They murdered him when they forced him out.
And Collins got away with it.
Think it over.
- Who is it?
- Brad. Open up.
What's the idea of moving?
I was afraid they'd find me. They were looking everywhere for you.
I'll say they were looking.
They raided the lodge and knocked over everybody but me.
I know, I read the papers. You got away.
Well, what are you staring about? You don't look very glad about it.
Oh, I am, Brad. But, gee, I've been scared to death.
- That's why I didn't leave word.
- I'll say you didn't.
I had to trace you through the trucking outfit that moved your stuff.
I'd still like to know how those coppers found us up there.
- They didn't get to you, did they?
- Oh, no. No, I've been safe here.
Yeah, sure.
You're a smart kid.
I just got the jumps.
Forget it. Crack open a bottle of whiskey and we'll celebrate.
There isn't any in the house.
Well, beat it down to the store and get some.
- And get me some cigarettes, will you?
- All right.
- You'll find some food in the icebox.
- Okay.
He may be doubling back now.
- I wanna warn Jean.
- I wanna ask her a few questions myself.
- All highways, driving black touring car. License 391284.
Collins escaped from apartment house at 2934 Modena.
Collins in Chicago? Okay, Burns.
Collins driving black touring car.
License 391284.
- Oh, hello, Brad.
- Get rid of that car, it's hot.
- Where you going?
- Oh, hello, Jeff.
- Why, I... I heard that Mr. Davis was here.
- Mr. Davis, huh?
- Was he badly hurt?
- Nothing serious.
They took one slug out of his chest and another creased his skull.
There's nothing to worry about. He's squawking about having to stay.
- I gotta beat it, kid.
- Jeff?
- How'd he get shot?
- Wait a minute.
He did it saving my life, and he showed a lot of nerve doing it too.
He's a great guy, Kay.
But don't tell him I said so.
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yeah, sure, fine. He just winged me.
If I'd come out a few minutes later, I'd have seen you. I could have warned you.
No, you did the right thing getting out of there as fast you could.
Come in.
- Oh, I... I'm sorry.
- Oh, please don't go. Come in.
- Miss Morgan, Miss McCord.
- How do you do?
Hello.
I heard what happened. I wanted to thank you for saving Jeff's life.
Oh, it wasn't much. We had a lucky break, that's all.
Did he tell you that?
No.
I wondered.
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes, I'm fine.
Well, I won't intrude any longer.
- Good night, Miss Morgan.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Well, I think I better go and let you get some sleep.
All right, Jean.
Don't go back to that apartment.
- You can't afford to take any chances.
- It was swell of you to try to help me, Brick.
- I was a little bit late.
- Yes, but it makes things different.
I used to think that at least I owed loyalty to Brad but I realize now I don't owe him anything.
He's done enough harm without doing any more.
Wait a minute. What do you mean?
- I think I know where to find him. - No, don't try it.
Stay away from him!
Good night, Brick.
- Got the guns?
- He'll have them in the shop.
You can get them at 2:00. You'll need them.
McCord and his G-men are knocking every place in town.
- They're gunning for you.
- They are?
They'll make somebody talk. When they do, they'll be down here quick.
- You better duck for Canada.
- Yeah.
- They'll blockade the roads.
- Don't worry about that.
I got a way of making McCord call off his dogs. Open that door.
Want me to phone if Mr. Davis starts running a temperature?
You stay away from him. He'll be better with the doctor.
- Thanks. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Miss McCord.
- Yes?
- Get in that sedan.
Get in that sedan.
Yeah, this is Collins. And you can tell McCord to get all patrols off the highways.
I've got his sister! And if they try to stop me, I'll dump her into their laps.
And she won't be talking.
Calling car 121. Car 121.
Urgent. To Special Agent McCord.
Special Agent McCord. Collins has kidnapped your sister.
Threatens to kill her if attempt made to capture.
Don't get impatient, baby. He won't be gone long.
Oh, hiya, Mrs. Collins. Come on in.
- I'm looking for Brad. Have you seen him?
- Yeah, he was here.
He'll be back pretty soon.
Say, you sure were lucky getting out just before the cops jumped him.
- He told you?
- Yeah.
Close, wasn't it?
- Who's the dame?
- That? That's the G-guy's sister.
They got the heat on Brad, but they'll lay off when they find out he's liable to bump this chicken.
- Lose all your guns at the lodge?
- Yeah.
Well, it was a good hideout. Too bad the cops got hold of your wife.
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't you know?
- No, I didn't.
- Why, it's a cinch she spilled it.
They had her at government headquarters the morning before they raided you.
Thanks.
What's the idea of leaving? He's coming soon.
I know. I'll be right back. I wanna get a few things.
- I'm going with him.
- That's up to you.
Oh, hello there, good-looking.
- Your wife was just here.
- When?
She just left a few minutes ago.
- She see the dame? - Sure.
She said she's going with you.
She's gonna rat to the cops. Which way did she go?
Well, that way.
Wait!
Come on back, they'll get you! You got time to get away!
You can't make it!
- Did a dame go by here?
- One just went in the lunchroom.
Hello, General Hospital? Brick Davis, please. Hurry.
- Hello, Brick? Jean. I found him.
- At it again, huh?
Police!
Operator, where's that receiver down?
Wait a minute, Mr. Davis. You can't get up yet.
- You can't get up yet!
- Shut up and get my clothes!
Look here, Mr. Davis. You can't leave here.
There she is, in there.
- Special agent.
- Yes, sir.
- How is she?
- I don't think she has a chance.
Jean.
Jean.
Brick.
You've got to get there. Garage.
809 Allen Street.
Brad's got the McCord girl in his car.
Collins has Kay?
He's gonna try to get to Canada.
You've got to get there first.
I wouldn't make her talk too much.
I'll see you later.
I won't be around.
Sure you will.
Say there's no rule that says a G-man can't kiss an old friend goodbye, is there?
Hello, police headquarters? Special Agent Davis speaking.
Yeah, I've located Collins. In a garage, 809 Allen Street.
809. Yeah, send cars.
He's holding Chief McCord's sister. I'm going there now. Hurry!
Calling all cars, Division Six. All cars, Division Six.
Collins located, 809 Allen Street.
809 Allen Street. A garage.
- Come on, step on it!
- Better give them time to clear the roads.
Down.
Come on, copper.
Are you gonna let her have it or am I?
Come on, copper! Come on out and get it.
- You all right?
- Did you get him?
- Yeah, where's Kay?
- Inside.
- Is she all right?
- She's all right.
- Did they get him?
- Yes, with a machine gun.
- He crashed into a building down the street.
- Kay.
- Are you okay, kid?
- I'm all right. But where's Brick?
Oh, Jeff, he was wonderful.
- Thanks, Davis.
- A pleasure.
Don't you think you better be getting back to the hospital?
Yeah, I guess that's a good idea.
- I'm going with him.
- Take good care of him, sis.
He's a great guy.
Shall I tell him you said so?
Yeah.
- How you feeling, Brick?
- Fine.
- Take care of yourself, Brick.
- Thanks.
I'm going over to get the car.
I'm gonna handle your case personally.
It's gonna be nice having a nurse in the family.
Eight o'clock. All's well. Misty weather.
-Here ye are, me lad.
A press gang. A press gang!
The press gang!
Let's get out of here!
In the king's name!
Well, we got all the fish we need in one net.
-Line them up, boatswain. -Aye, aye. Line up, lads!
Lads, bow your necks and weep. You're in the king's navy.
I'm no seaman, sir. I'm a tailor.
What's that, your needlework?
No chin music.
-What ship? -The Bounty, for the South Seas.
-The South Seas?
-That's the end of the world. No, he sailed there with Captain Cook.
He knows the brown gals gay as kiss-me.
-Who's the captain?
-Bligh!
-Seize him!
How long will we be gone?
Till there's enough frost in hell to kill snap beans.
How long is that, sir?
I've got to know.
-Two years, lad.
-Please, don't take my husband.
When we had a baby, Tommy left the sea.
He don't want to serve in the navy.
-It's true, sir. -Sorry, the king needs six men.
You can't take him!
It's like forever!
I can't take them and not take him.
No, you can't take him!
I won't let you!
-Lass, lass. -It's two years!
No!
It's two years!
This is England's new venture in science, in trade, in discovery.
Who else but Sir Austin Byam's son should go?
But two years.
-I understand, my dear.
Ship ahoy!
Bob.
Behold!
The elder son of the sea and heir to all its oceans.
Uniform by Jeeves.
It's so new, it creaks.
I'll come back an admiral, with a necklace for you.
Pearls as big as coconuts.
I'll name a nice shiny island after you, Sir Joseph.
-I owe you for my appointment.
-You've been appointed for one purpose:
To make me a dictionary of the Tahitian language.
I've made that clear to Captain Bligh.
-What's he like, sir?
-Captain Bligh?
He's a seagoing disaster.
His hair is rope yarn. His teeth are marlinespikes.
Marlinespikes?
Good.
Sounds rather terrifying. But perhaps, as your father used to say:
"A taut hand at sea is better than a slack one."
You'd have made a rare sailor, ma'am.
Why don't you stow away, Mother?
I've considered it. Very seriously.
Well, here's to the voyage of the Bounty.
Still waters and the great golden sea.
Flying fish like streaks of silver and mermaids that sing in the night.
The Southern Cross, and all the stars on the other side of the world.
Bless my soul. To the voyage of the Bounty!
Is that the Bounty?
No, sir. That's the flagship of the fleet.
There's your little pint-pot.
That's the Bounty for Tahiti?
She isn't very big, is she?
It ain't the size that counts, youngster. It's the salt in the lads that man it.
-Where's your sweetheart? -She married a sailor.
Oh.
It's ElIison, sir. He tried to break ship.
-On deck, Morrison. -Aye, sir.
-Churchill.
Break ship, would you?
I can't face it, sir. Not two years.
I might not come back. Then she's left with the baby.
Flog me, send me to jail, but don't take me, sir!
Don't.
Now, listen to me, ElIison.
The sea's hard, but you whistle it off.
Do your spit and polish and you'lI come home with the seals following in admiration.
I was like you when I first came to sea, Cumberland moss all over me.
Now it's turned to barnacles.
That's better.
On this voyage, if you get in trouble, come to me. I'll see you get justice.
But if you're wrong, look out for squalls.
Now, get your chin up.
Go on deck. Say goodbye to your wife.
-You've got her aboard, sir?
-And the baby.
-Come on. Shake a leg. -Thank you, sir.
-So you're going to the South Seas?
-Aye.
Here. Take this with you.
You can buy your own island. Ten shillings.
Ten?
I ain't seen the king's face on a shilling for so long I've forgotten which George it is, but I'll take it and pay you when I get back.
sailor!
You're not coming back, not in this little half-walnut.
Here you are. Diamond brooch.
Real gold, mister, owned by Captain Kidd.
With a map of the treasure under the works.
Here. Stand clear with the tinware, Joe.
You keep leeward of the ship's gentlemen.
All right, now. Ta-ta.
Mr. Byam?
I'm Fletcher Christian, lieutenant and master's mate.
-You'Il be my instructor.
-Yes, in navigation and trigonometry.
You'll have a watch, keep order, go aloft to mend canvas, reef and furl.
Otherwise, your time is your own.
Mr. Christian, in my hands, the ship is safe.
I understand.
"A little child shall lead them."
Come along, I'll show you below.
You there, take Mr. Byam's box to his berth.
-Ahoy, Mr. Christian!
Good morning, sir.
Nothing lost, Mr. Christian.
Think I've got enough for a two years' voyage?
You know your draft better than I do. My lad, nobody can estimate my draft, least of all myself.
-Easy, easy. -What makes her roll so?
Here's a navy for you.
Rum in the skimmers today and blood in the scuppers tomorrow.
This is our ship's surgeon. We call him Mr. Bacchus.
-He's never told us his real name. -I've forgotten it.
Pleased to meet you.
Mr. Byam, I should never have gone ashore.
England's only an island, and all islands are alike.
I'm going below. Bear a hand.
Easy, now. Easy.
Oh, Tommy, I'm afeard. This ship's unlucky.
They've changed the name.
Well, I changed your name, didn't I?
Was that unlucky?
Oh, Tommy.
One, two....
Three of us in here?
My dog at home has a bigger kennel all to himself.
I can see we shall be as friendly as tomcats in a sack.
Mr. Stewart?
Mr. Byam.
Drop in anytime, Byam. I'll be just 10 inches away from you.
-A pleasure, Mr. Stewart. -I hope you'll like the ship.
-I'd Iike any ship, Mr. Stewart.
-Johnny Newcomer.
Oh, yes, Mr. Byam, the amiable Mr. Hayward.
-How do you do?
Hayward has been two years at sea.
And a man who's been two years at sea should know how to lash his hammock.
Yours looks like a Frenchman's knapsack.
All right. On deck, all of you.
Mr. Maggs?
This here Captain Bligh, sir.
Now, you being ship's clerk would you call him a gentle officer?
If I was you, I wouldn't be calling him anything.
Oh, no, no, no, Mr. Maggs, no.
Never call anybody anything.
But I do hope he is gentle because I'm his messman and I frighten so easy.
It runs in our family, Mr. Maggs.
My mother was frightened by my father before I was born and I've been frightened ever since.
Do you know there's times when I can hardly hold a glass in my hand?
-Silence. The captain's coming aboard.
Company, atten!
Mr. Christian, clear the decks of this rabble.
Very good, sir. Clear decks. Everybody ashore.
-Mr. Fryer, we sail at six bells. -Sail at six bells.
-We got our rights here. -Off ship, Joe. Off ship.
I'm not going until the ship sails.
Hey, you can't do that!
Flogging through the fleet.
We're included.
-A compliment to the Bounty, Sir Joseph.
Mr. Christian, pipe the ship's company at five bells to witness punishment.
Would you care to see the flogging?
No. The only discipline I know is science.
There's science in using a cat-o'-nine-tails. Watch my boatswain.
I really must be off. I came aboard merely to introduce Roger.
Goodbye, my boy.
This won't be all cakes and ale, Roger but your family's followed the sea for seven generations.
Not one ever failed in his duty.
In a tight place, that's all you'll need to remember.
-I'lI try to, sir. -Sure you will, my boy.
-Goodbye, Mr. Bligh. -Goodbye, Sir Joseph.
What does it mean, sir, "flogging through the fleet"?
Sentence of court-martiaI, two dozen lashes at each ship.
What was the man's crime, sir?
Struck his captain.
But that's over 300 lashes. I don't understand why--
Can you understand this?
Discipline's the thing.
A seaman's a seaman, captain's a captain.
And a midshipman is the lowest form of animal life in the British navy.
Now you know what a midshipman is.
Line up!
Port oars!
Ship's company, off hats!
Article 22: "If any officer, mariner or other person in the fleet shall strike or offer to strike any of his superiors and being convicted, he shall suffer punishment inflicted on him by the sentence of a court-martial."
Ship's company, on hats!
-Mr. Morrison, two dozen, I believe. -Two dozen it is, sir.
-The man is dead, sir.
-Shall I dismiss the men, sir?
-What?
Certainly not. We'll proceed with punishment.
Boatswain, do your duty.
Come along with you.
Do your duty!
Bloody murderer.
Mr. Byam!
Punishment counted out, sir. -Mr. Morrison, come aboard.
-Mr. Fryer, make ready to sail. -Starboard watch, secure for sea.
Starboard watch, shorten and cable!
Stand by to go aloft!
In captain's gig, Mr. Christian.
Both watches, hoist! Hoist away! -Topsails.
Way aloft!
Winds offshore!
You'll take the mizzenmast, Mr. Byam.
What's the matter, afraid to go aloft?
Why, it's child's play.
That man they flogged.
He was dead.
Get aloft. Bear a hand.
Mr. Morrison, start those men.
Tallyho!
Child's play.
Anchors aweigh, sir.
Let fall!
Down from aloft!
Down from there!
A dozen for the coat of the last man down!
Please, sir!
Skipper Hayward!
Mr. Hayward!
-I'lI take care of him.
-Keep hold!
Hoist away!
Set courses, royals and gallants!
Royals and gallants!
Starboard bridges, aweigh with the anchors.
-Ship ready. -Give her lee helm.
Lee helm, sir.
-Steady. -Steady, sir.
There she goes. Her anchor's up.
Oh, Mary, it's such a little ship.
My Tommy will bring her home.
Hurrah!
Hurrah!
-We're under canvas again, Mr. Christian. -Yes, sir.
-It's our third voyage together. -Not of my choosing.
So the port admiral told me. Well, you're here. I requested you.
I like having a gentleman as my subordinate, being a self-made man.
I admire you for that, sir.
And for very little else?
sailing orders?
Tahiti direct by Cape Horn.
Winds permitting.
If we can't make westing, we shall have to go by Africa.
Then we'll have to get supplies at Simon's Bay.
We'll need them. This ship has less food than a prison hull. And I don't trust that clerk of yours.
Who asked you to meddle with my clerk?
Can't get much from a hungry man. I have to work these men we feed.
Rascals and pirates. Did you see them growl at the flogging?
I'll teach them what flogging's like.
My advice, sir, if you'll take it, is not to be too harsh with them.
We're sailing 10,000 miles together for the next two years.
-It's like a powder magazine. -I don't want your advice.
I've my own way with seamen. They respect one law, the law of fear.
-My officers should remember that. -I can only tell you what I think!
They come from jails and taverns, but they're English and they'll sail anywhere.
I'm not interested in what you think.
I expect you to carry out whatever orders I give, whenever I give them.
I'll carry out your orders, Mr. Bligh.
Then we understand each other?
Perfectly.
-Any orders for the deck? -No.
-That all?
-Yes. You may go.
Thank you, sir.
-She's flying, Mr. Christian. -Tahiti direct, sir.
Tahiti direct, Mr. Christian.
Pass it on: No change of sail without my orders.
Put two men at the wheel. -We'Il carry on or carry under. -Very good, sir.
-Southeast by east. -Southeast by east, sir.
No change in sails... -...except for captain's orders. -Good.
Mr. Byam, you'Il stand by for midshipman's school.
Aye, aye, sir.
You!
hold up, there!
Never empty your buckets into the wind!
Find the wind, you idiot!
Find the wind and then choose your rail.
Get below!
We're off around the world, boys.
Light hearts and tight britches. Off around the world.
Oh, dry up, you cub.
Is it human, or what do you think?
I can't stand yowling water babies.
Blast you!
I told you not to swing that lantern!
You don't mean it makes you seasick?
An old buccaneer like you? La-di-da.
I'll knock more tar out of you than it'll take a month to mix.
-Come on, blowhard. -Oh, stow it, will you?
I can't make head or tail of this navigation.
Don't worry. lf you get tangled, I'll jump in and pull you out.
You'd better not try and fool Mr. Christian. Mr. Christian holds no terrors for me.
I can wade the seven seas and never wet my shirt.
They have whales that can sink a ship, but I can sink the whale.
Behold, the face that launched a thousand ships.
Gentlemen.
Today's navigating problem:
Given the altitude of Polaris, could you find your latitude, Mr. Stewart?
To lead up to it ordinarily, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
Uh, but this is not true of navigation. We must consider winds and currents--
Yes. Suppose you considered the problem.
-Perhaps Mr. Stewart means that it's like that lantern, sir.
We assume it should hang straight down, but because the ship is rolling it swings to and fro.
But by watching it closely--
You disagree with Byam, Mr. Hayward?
He knows the lantern makes me seasick. He's doing it to break up the lesson.
-Stewart doesn't know his problem. -still, his original theory interests me.
Please, sir.
Proceed, Mr. Byam. You were saying, by watching the lantern closely--
What seems to be the trouble, Mr. Stewart?
Watch the wind, Mr. Stewart.
It's not there. It's there.
Is that the face that launched a thousand ships?
One navigation problem and three wrecks.
Smart as paint, you are.
Why, you ungrateful swab.
After I've given my all for the honor of the class.
Byam!
It wasn't my fault. He came behind and struck me.
-Is that true, Mr. Byam?
-I'd rather not say, sir.
So you want to fight?
I'll cool you off.
Get to the masthead and stay there until I call you down.
all the way, sir?
-All the way.
-Get below or go aloft!
-Yes, sir!
Rather heavy weather to send him aloft, isn't it?
They must learn this isn't a beer garden. If you don't teach them, I will!
Look alive, you crawling caterpillar!
-Where's Byam?
-I couldn't help it, Stewart.
When the man looks at me, I want to jump overboard.
Where's Byam?
-The old man sent him aloft. -You let him take the blame, huh?
Here, here!
You've started enough trouble!
Time you learn discipline!
Get into your hammock... -...before I put you over a gun!
Get up!
You see, sir? It isn't my fault.
They're only jealous because I've been at sea before.
Who did that?
I did, sir.
Come here.
Good.
How she creaks. Wind's a gale.
I'm too old to envy young Byam aloft.
-Splice the main-brace, Mr. Morgan. -I'lI take it to kill germs.
What?
Waste my brandy?
Here, you use the ship's drinking water. It would shrivel me wooden leg.
Did you ever hear how I lost my leg?
-No, no, but we will. -Well--
-I'm worried about Byam. -Oh, he'll weather it all right.
Well, I left my leg with John paul Jones back in '78.
We came astern with a Yankee.
Up went our colors and our captain hails, "What ship is that?"
"American ship Ranger," roars Jones, and up go his colors.
"Louder, you Yankee pip-squeak," our captain yells.
"I can't hear you!"
"Can you hear this?" says Jones, and he lets go a broadside.
Thundering guns.
You all right?
-Nothing lost, Mr. Christian. -Look after him, Mr. Morgan.
Keep her head up!
Starboard!
Get him below, to the surgeon!
Mr. Christian!
-Who brought that man down?
-I did, sir!
But I sent him aloft!
He's gone under. The top's no place.
I know his place. Time you knew yours.
Maintain discipline, not break it!
Send him aloft again!
Mr. Bligh, he's had enough!
Send him aloft again!
That's right, lad. Drink another. You'll be as right as a truism.
If you'd lost a leg, now....
I lost mine in action against the French, off Jamaica.
A French surgeon did the trick for me.
He apologized in French, and I cursed him in English.
-How is he?
-I'm all right, sir.
He'lI go anywhere.
Get to the masthead again, Byam.
-I've taken my punishment, sir. -Get to the masthead!
I've had a bellyful of that masthead from Captain Bligh!
-You can't make me go back again! -Byam.
It was Mr. Christian brought you down, lad.
Thank you, sir.
I didn't understand. Captain's orders.
-You mind? -No.
Let him have it.
Here, you'lI need this.
Here's something else you'Il need. You're a plucky youngster.
If necessary, I'd be happy to cut off your leg anytime.
Thank you, sir.
-If anything happens to that lad, Bligh--
-Christian!
Christian, careful!
Ship's company, off hats.
O eternal God, who alone spreadest out the heavens and rulest the raging sea, who has compassed the waters with bounds until night and day come to an end receive into thy almighty and most gracious protection the persons of us, thy servants and the fleet in which we serve.
Preserve us from the dangers of the sea that we may be a safeguard unto our gracious lord King George and his kingdoms and a security for such as pass on the seas upon their lawful occasions and that we may return in safety to enjoy the blessings of the land with a remembrance of thy mercies to praise and glorify thy holy name through Jesus Christ our Lord, amen.
Amen.
-Ship's company, on hats.
The ship's company will bear in mind we are at sea under the articles of war.
Perhaps you are unaware that the articles of war invest in me the authority to order punishment.
During the recent heavy weather, I've watched you at work on deck and aloft.
You don't know wood from canvas, and it seems that you don't want to learn.
Well, I'lI have to give you a lesson. You, you, you, step forward.
You three are a disgrace to saltwater!
Ten days on half rations. What's your name?
-Thomas Burkitt, sir.
-He's a thief, sir. Dartmoor Prison. -A thief.
-Convicted. Offered a choice:
Dartmoor Prison or the king's navy. You've been to Dartmoor Prison, Burkitt?
-Yes, sir. -It seems you prefer the navy.
You may regret that choice before this voyage is over.
Your name?
Thomas Ellison, sir. Pressed into service.
I've got a wife, a baby.
I asked your name, not the history of your misfortunes.
Your name? -Smith. -Not you, you idiot!
You.
-William Muspratt, sir. -Have you got a wife, Muspratt?
Have you got a wife?
Two, sir.
The ship's company will remember that I am your captain, judge and your jury.
You do your duty and we may get along but whatever happens, you'll do your duty.
Lively, lads.
Thief. Nobody calls me a thief but the men I steals from.
Half rations.
You there!
Who did that?
I can't tell you, sir.
-Mr. Morrison. -Aye, sir.
-Report that man for two dozen lashes.
I done it, sir.
Pick it up.
Put it back.
-Mr. Morrison, lay on with a will.
Bligh, these men aren't king-and-country volunteers.
They've been brought aboard by press gangs.
In a week, I'll get some spirit without flogging.
Teach them who's master and never let them forget.
-Mr. Morrison! Aye.
Before we see port, I'll make them jump at a midshipman's jacket even if it's hung on a broomstick to dry.
Give this man his two dozen. When I ask for information, I expect to get it.
-I didn't hear the watch call, sir. -Why not?
Sorry, I was cleaning brass for Mr. Byam. That's true, sir.
Stretch this man over a gun and give him two dozen lashes.
But I was responsible, sir. Byam will be in charge of the punishment.
Two dozen. That's enough, Mr. Morrison.
Man overboard!
-Bring a line!
Idiot. I'll have to teach my top men not to fall off the ship.
Mr. Morrison! When you get him onboard, stretch him with a rail to dry him off.
I can't stand it. I got to get water.
Get back to your work.
I wanted water for my knees, sir. I can't stand it. Please, sir.
-What is it?
-This man left his work. Wants water.
Look, sir, it's the sand worked in cruel.
-I wanted water to wash it. -I'lI give you water.
Mr. Morrison, keelhaul this man.
Haul away!
-Well?
-The man is dead, Mr. Bligh.
Mr. Bligh, I've seen calms and doldrums, but not one like this in 40 years.
-The men in the boats are worn-out. -Not the way they're pulling.
-Put new men into the boats. -Mr. Morrison, pipe the men.
Dive in with your mess, lads.
Mr. Byam, look at this bit of meat, sir. It's alive.
I'm sorry, lad. There's nothing I can do about it.
This bit of meat was mined in a rock quarry.
-Here, I'll change with you, lad. -Thanks.
It's alive, all right but they're fresh meat anyway.
Mr. Byam, I'm reporting these two men unfit for duty.
-Very good. You men are relieved.
What's the delay here?
You realize we're waiting for these men to pull us into a wind?
The men haven't finished mess, and these two are unfit for duty.
-Unfit? !
-My orders, sir.
If they can walk, they can work.
Put them in the boats and get these other men out immediately.
Any sign of a breeze, sir?
I'm about at the end of my rope.
Keep up your stroke, man. I'll whistle a wind up for you.
Can't we...?
-Can't we rest a spell, sir?
-No, and keep your hatch closed.
This is the cask with only one cheese in, sir.
-What's this? What's this?
-Two cheeses are gone.
-What?
-Two 50-pound cheeses missing.
-Stolen, of course, sir. -Thieves and jailbirds! -What?
-A hundred pounds of cheese gone.
They'd steal canvas off a corpse.
-Strange. I checked the stores myself. -Cheeses can't fly, fool!
They've been stolen, of course.
Stop allowance of cheese until the theft is made up. -Yes, sir.
-Pardon, sir.
Back in Portsmouth that cask was opened by you and Mr. Maggs had the cheeses carried ashore.
-Silence!
-Perhaps you'll recollect, sir.
-Maggs had me take them to your house. -You insolent scoundrel!
But I remember very well, sir. I didn't get to see my wife that day.
Boatswain, spread-eagIe that liar to the rigging till sundown.
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Wind off the starboard bow, sir.
-Man the lee board braces! Aye, aye, sir.
Here.
Get that.
Well, Mr. Christian, if your rascals are any good, bring us into the wind.
Boats!
-Pull, lads! pull!
-Lay into it, now.
Get up.
Send her up, Burkitt. pull!
Mr. Byam, pull up their strokes!
pull!
Pull! -Mr.
Hayward, speed up! -Mr.
Byam, use your rope's end!
Come on, lads, pull!
-Come on, pick them up.
pull!
We're almost in!
Put your weight in it!
Good lad, Muspratt. Pull, lads!
We're in!
-We're in!
well done, there!
Shall I call the boats in, sir?
They've done their job.
What do you expect me to do, knight them?
Hoist the boats.
-Aye, sir.
-Good, lads! Good, lads!
Well, we are out of the doldrums at last, sir.
I told you to spread-eagle that liar. Why hasn't it been done?
Very good, sir.
Come along, McCoy.
There's nothing more powerful than brandy.
I threw a brandy bottle overboard once, empty one, off the coast of Madagascar.
Three years later, I picked it up in a river in Portugal.
It had gone back to its home vineyard for more.
You would've made an excellent historian. You have a profound contempt for facts.
I don't despise facts, sir, I'm indifferent to them.
Water. Water.
Cheese, Mr. Christian?
No, thank you, sir.
-Mr. Byam?
-No, thank you, sir.
-Mr. Fryer?
-No, thank you, sir.
Perhaps the surgeon wants cheese.
No, thank you, sir. It's bad for my innards.
To the best of my recollection, Mr. Christian, you're partial to cheese.
Not tonight, sir.
Burn me. I believe you're with the men.
If you'lI allow me, I think you've been unjust.
-Unjust?
A bit of cheese, more or less. Unjust?
In other words, you say I'm the man who lied.
I didn't say that, sir. -You implied it.
I've no doubt that Maggs disposed of the cheeses without your knowledge but I can't understand your treatment of the man who obeyed orders.
Maggs is my clerk. It's not for my men to question his orders.
Nor for you to question mine!
I want your apology.
I have nothing more to say, sir.
Then you can dine elsewhere on what you can get!
-Mr. Bligh. -Byam.
Gentlemen.
Come, he implied it, didn't he, Mr. Byam?
Well, I can also dispense with your company!
Thank you, sir.
So you're all against me, officers and men.
Won't eat cheese, eh?
Before I'm done with you, I'll make you eat grass!
I'm so hungry, if my mother would reach out to pet me I'd have a bit of her hand.
There's fish there, all right, but they're making jokes about the bait.
You see--
If I could prove what I suspect, I--
No, I wouldn't. I'm so weak, I'm peaceful.
Muspratt, Burkitt, look here, supper.
What?
Why--
Why, Mr. Christian, sir. Take a look at this, sir.
Supper for six men. Four pounds, they calls it.
If that weighs more than 2, I'll eat the cat-o'-nine-tails.
-It ain't pig. it's horse meat.
-We pulled our hearts out for this breeze. -And what do we get?
We starve.
-Well, little meat, no distemper.
Keep the wind in the sails and out of your stomach.
If it's any comfort, the officers are in the same boat.
Not Captain BIigh. He's getting fat, the dirty, thieving--
Burkitt!
Any more of that, and I'Il clap you in irons.
Yes, sir.
Buckoes. Buckoes.
Here's your supper.
-Thompson, get your hook and line. -Right.
See him?
He's a big one, eh?
-Here you are, Burkitt.
Well, we've got to have bait.
Sharks ain't seamen. They expect to eat.
We've got to have bait.
-You want to risk this for a meal? -Aye.
-I'm willing.
If the hook don't kill him, that pork will.
Let it go.
There he goes. There he goes.
-Got him. -On deck with him.
-Easy, now. Easy, now. Easy, now.
You first, Burkitt. Choose for your mess.
-Thanks, mates. -Yeah, fine catch you've got there.
You know I must have a slice, eh?
-Shark eat shark?
-You forget yourself.
You give me a slice, a nice, large one, and I'Il say nothing.
Tell him, you slimy quill-pusher. Take your slice!
At ease, lads. At ease.
Well, how's our shark-killer, huh?
He's cut to bits, sir.
He'lI be all right. What's a flogging?
A few blows and a few "ohs," and then you put on your shirt.
-Here. -Thank you, sir.
Now, if you'd lost a leg, my lad....
I left mine with a Spanish pirate off the coast of Trinidad.
A bullfighter did the trick for me.
He was so drunk he nearly cut off the wrong leg.
Hey!
Here.
You'll be all right.
A bit tattooed on the back perhaps, but just the right style for Tahiti, eh?
-Hey, fiddler, give him a tune. -Aye, sir.
-Good night, lads. -Good night, sir.
Listen, Byam.
You can flog those fellows, starve them... -...but they'll bob up again with a fiddle.
-Music at sea I never imagined how beautiful it was.
Master-at-arms, stop that infernal jamboree. -It's worse than two cats on a fence. Aye, aye, sir.
The old death's-head.
I've never known a better seaman, but as a man, he's a snake.
He doesn't punish for discipline. He likes to see men crawl.
I'd like to push his poison down his own throat.
You both have one thing in common, the devil's own temper.
He can let his go but whether I can keep mine bottled up for the next two years is a question.
I believe you will.
Whatever happens, I'll always be glad I've known you.
I'll remember that when you're an admiral. Good night, youngster.
Good night.
-More tea, sir?
-No, you get out.
Yes, sir.
-You sent for me, sir?
-Yes, I've got a job for you this morning.
-Sit down. Had your breakfast?
-Yes, thank you, sir.
I want you to sign the list of all supplies issued on the voyage.
Certify and sign.
We should raise the island anytime now. Not a bad voyage so far.
All hands accounted for. Only six down with scurvy.
Five with scurvy, one with flogging.
Correct, there's your credit. Five with scurvy, one with flogging.
We're still under canvas.
Mr. Bligh, I can't sign this book. No such amounts have been issued.
You've signed daybooks with extra kegs the ship never carried.
-I have, sir. -And why not? We all do it.
We'd be fools if we didn't on a lieutenant's pay.
I want to stow away enough to keep me out of the gutter.
I understand, a captain's prerogative. Ordinarily, I wouldn't mind.
Why is this case different?
The captains I've served with didn't starve their men.
They didn't save money by buying up the stinking meat.
They didn't buy yams that would sicken a pig. Silence!
They didn't call their men thieves and flog them in the bone.
-Impudent scoundrel!
Sign that book!
-I refuse and you have no authority.
I haven't? !
I'll show you authority. Lay all hands aft!
All hands aft!
Very good, sir.
Company, attend!
Mr. Christian, step forward.
"If any officer or other person in the fleet shall disobey any lawful command of any of his superior officers, every such person being convicted of such offense shall suffer death or other punishment as shall be inflicted on him by the sentence of a court-martial."
Mr. Christian, you will sign this book.
Mr. Bligh the ship's company will bear witness that I sign in obedience to your orders.
But remember, sir, I shall demand a court of inquiry in England.
You mutinous dog.
-Retract that, sir.
-I will repeat it. You're a mutinous dog. -Mr.
Christian. -Land ho, sir!
Furl away!
There she waits, lads!
-What is it, Mr. Fryer?
-Tahiti, you fool.
Oh.
So you'lI face me with a court of inquiry?
We're a Iong way from England and what can happen on this ship before we get there may surprise even you.
Milk!
It's milk!
Captain, they got cows here that lays eggs. What a place.
Would you help me up, sir?
I'd like to see the island.
What for?
All islands are alike.
That's a singularly stupid observation, sir, and grossly unscientific.
Well, science is one thing and experience is another.
-See one island, you've seen them all. -Fiddlesticks.
Well, I'm to be first ashore. Captain's orders, to begin my dictionary.
I'll get my trade goods. We can go ashore together.
All right, then.
-I know that man. -Who is he?
A friend of Captain Cook's when I was sailing master.
Hitihiti, chief of the island, priest of the temple.
Pipe him aboard. -Mr.
Fryer, dress ship. -Very good, sir. Dress ship!
Bligh.
-Bligh. -Hitihiti.
-Bligh, you got fat.
-Oh, well, it is 10 years since we sailed together with Captain Cook.
-I beg your pardon?
-Where Captain Cook?
Uh, Captain Cook is dead.
-Morti?
-Yes, yes, morti.
-He was a good man. -Oh, yes.
-Hail King George.
-King George?
Captain Cook say King George come on next English ship.
His Majesty is extremely sorry he couldn't come.
I beg your pardon?
My hat.
Captain Cook say if King George don't come, he send hat.
Yes, yes, yes!
Of course, the hat.
Mr. Maggs, go to my cabin and bring me the hat--
-The cocked hat, you fool! -Yes, sir.
The hat will be here in one moment.
So we shall require 1000 breadfruit plants.
-Breadfruit?
Uru. -Correct, uru. Uru.
-All we have for you. -Thank you, thank you.
We shall have to stay here for several months.
We shall have provision--
-They're welcome to anything.
-Don't be a fool. -You'Il need those gifts to make friends.
-Him no need gift, my friend.
-Me Hitihiti, you my tayo. -Tayo?
Chief makes you his friend.
-In my tongue, close friend.
You live home, my home. Tayo.
Friend, the finest word in any language.
-It shall be the first in my dictionary.
The hat. Yes, thank you.
With the compliments of His Majesty King George III of Great Britain.
-Byam, you come ashore with me. -Sir?
Permission granted, mind you report... -...onboard ship every night.
-Byam will live with my family. -Impossible.
-I can have no favorites aboard my ship. -Bligh, you are chief on this ship but I am chief on that island.
Byam will come with me, yes?
Perhaps that's best. Permission granted.
By the way, Mr. Morrison, pipe the ship's company aft.
Aye, aye, sir. All hands aft.
Well, we're here. Tahiti at last.
England to Cape Horn, Africa, New Zealand Van Diemen's Land and the great South Seas.
I've sailed the Bounty over 27,000 miles and you think you've come to an island paradise a tropical grog shop of feast and song and sleep.
Well, you're wrong!
You're here to labor.
You'll fill this ship with breadfruit trees. You'll recondition her for sea.
Shore leave permitted if and when I can spare you.
If you abuse it, you'lI answer to me.
Remember, your work is finished when we drop anchor in Portsmouth Harbor.
Mr. Fryer will have charge of work ashore. Very good, sir.
Mr. Christian, you will remain onboard in charge of reconditioning the ship.
Unfortunately, you will have no shore leave while we're here at Tahiti.
That's all.
Hurry, hurry.
What a place.
Hey, when's dinner?
Your language is most un-EngIish.
It means exactly what it says.
Here are three pages on your words meaning "look."
-Plenty kind of look. -That's the trouble.
There's one for the downcast eyes, one for the sidelong glance one that invites, one that consents.
A whole language of looks.
Byam, you think too much.
One day, you head go crack.
No, no, no, Tehani. I've told you before.
I like my flowers in a bowl.
Now, scat. I'm busy.
What do you call that look, Byam?
The look of a charming girl who will still be happy when we english invaders go home.
By the way, what's your word for money?
Money?
What is money?
All right, I'Il explain.
Which would you choose?
The shilling or the nail?
Oh, no, Hitihiti. With one of these you can buy 20 of these.
-Oh?
Where? -Well, in England.
You see, in England, you must have money to live with to buy food.
In island of England, no fruit on tree?
-No fish in the sea?
-Oh, yes. Plenty.
No money, no food?
-That's right. -I stay here.
Byam, ahoy!
Sounds like Christian.
-Well, it can't be. -Maybe so.
Hitihiti, you got him leave!
Byam!
Fletcher!
Ahoy, Robinson Crusoe. -Fletcher!
I'd given up on seeing you ashore and Hitihiti never even winked.
When he came aboard wearing that hat, even the articles of war failed Mr. Bligh.
Christian. Christian. Lieutenant.
Thank you for speaking to the captain.
The sea is good, but the earth is good also. Be at home.
It's good to be ashore again. I've been as restless as....
Can you speak Tahitian yet?
Like a native.
Why, you little powder monkey!
If you cross my hawse again, I'Il spank your little starboard, understand?
-Yes. -Yes?
-Well, I didn't know you speak English. -Yes.
-You must think me a perfect fool.
-Well, does she or doesn't she?
-Yes. She speak English. One word: yes.
Mr. Byam, your Tahitian dictionary.
Madam.
This is Hitihiti's granddaughter.
-What did she say?
-You must be a king in your country.
What?
If His Majesty could see her as I see her now, he'd forgive the error.
-Shall I tell her that?
-No, no. Just say thank you.
Byam your friend is wise.
No work today. Go swim, all.
Come along, Fletcher. I'll show you an island you'll never forget.
-You can't imagine what it's--
They'd like to come with us, if you don't object.
-Object?
-I thought not.
Christian?
Aren't they amazing?
I never knew there were such people in the world.
They're simple and kind, and yet, somehow, they're royal.
What did you say?
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
I was just thinking what a contrast to the ship.
Tehani wants to race me.
-Oh.
-What's wrong?
He comes from the ship.
-Captain Bligh's orders. -Bligh?
You're to report onboard immediately.
Oh, I am?
Byam, I know his game!
He gives me leave and recalls it to devil me into insubordination.
I'll oblige him!
I'll have one day off that ship if I swing for it!
Tell him I refuse!
What did she say?
The man will tell Captain Bligh you can't be found.
Oh, thank you. I'm sorry I lost my temper.
She says you were magnificent, like a storm at sea.
-Thanks for your kindness. -You will come again?
That rests with you and the captain. -You will come again.
-Thank you.
Byam, it's been a day.
Goodbye, Maimiti.
-Goodbye, all. -Goodbye, Fletcher.
-Good morning, sir. -Good morning, Mr. Stewart.
Mr. Bligh wishes you to report to him as soon as you come aboard, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Stewart.
-Reporting, sir. -You relieve my anxiety.
I was about to send an armed shore party to look for you.
-I had your permission, sir. -You're a fine figure of a king's officer.
If I could prove to that native you're a liar, they'd arrest you!
You'll regret this!
Before this voyage is over, you'll know who's master here!
Mr. Bligh, I have in mind the dead seaman you had flogged in Portsmouth.
He struck his captain.
You'd like me to strike you.
-Well, I won't do it. -Very clever, Mr. Christian.
1000 plants, sir. The pick of the island!
Mr. Morgan, I shall commend your industry to Sir Joseph Banks.
Thank you.
There's one difficulty, sir, a very grave one.
These growing plants require more water than we can store aboard.
We can't let them die, sir.
We won't.
Mr. Morgan, I'll take these trees to the West Indies every tree in prime condition.
I shall cut the water allowance for the entire ship's company.
Good morrow to you.
I'll drink your health in Portsmouth!
-Put your stuff there. -It's mine, sir. It's a gift.
Captain's orders. Put it down and go forward!
Shore leave in heaven, duty in hell again.
-What have you got there?
-Monday Wash, sir.
It's a pet, sir. Her name's Monday Wash.
Mr. Maggs, take that laundry for the captain's table.
But, sir!
Now get forward!
-Come along, there. Hurry!
-Did he hurt you?
No, but one day, I'll take that cane away-- Look behind you.
Yes.
Aren't you coming aboard, Hitihiti?
I have said farewell to Bligh. I have sent gift to King George.
-Then this is goodbye. -Yes.
Byam, tayo.
-You have been happy here?
-Very happy, Hitihiti.
Byam, I have no son. Stay here with me. Be my son.
I must return to England.
I shall never come back.
Byam...
-...you will think of us sometime. -Hitihiti.
Roger!
Will you come here, please?
-Look. -Big as gooseberries!
Make her understand. These are priceless, I can't take them.
She says they're for your mother.
Well, thank her, Roger.
And tell her when this voyage is over, somehow, I'm coming back.
-I can't tell her that. -I mean it, Roger.
But it's a dream, Fletcher.
This island isn't real for you and me. It's the ship that's real. It's taking us home.
Tell her, Roger.
Thank you, Roger.
Goodbye, Maimiti.
That's right. No tears, lass.
Love?
Love.
Goodbye.
Reporting with deserters. Taken on the other side of the island. No resistance.
Very well, Mr. Young.
So you let them take you alive.
You'll regret that, me lads. Take them below.
We ain't deserters, sir.
You kept us aboard because we dropped that tub of breadfruit.
-We wanted to see the island--
-Take them below and put them in irons.
Prisoners in escort, into file.
Left, turn!
Quick march!
-Is she ready for sea, Mr. Fryer?
-Ready, sir.
-Set topsails and jibs. -Stand by. Topsails and jibs.
All hands on deck!
Looking about me, I can't believe we're in a ship of the royal navy.
The deck's like a barnyard!
Paradise is astern, gentlemen.
I'll break the men of that island if I have to flog every thieving--
Which reminds me 10 coconuts, Crown property, were stolen on your watch.
Correct, Mr. Maggs?
I counted myself. -I'lI account for the men in my watch.
-They didn't take them. -Can you account for yourself?
Mr. Bligh, may I recall the outward voyage?
Harsh things were said, but I hoped the return trip would be better.
Then suppose you return the 10 coconuts.
-You think I'm so fond of them I'd steal?
-Yes, you hypocrite.
You stole Crown property more valuable. -Explain that!
-Pearls, Mr. Christian.
-Pearls?
I believe I said pearls.
Fortunately, Mr. Maggs was at the boat. He saw that native woman give you two pearls.
I think I'm beginning to understand.
The native woman, as you call her, gave the pearls to me.
-They are not Crown property. -The goods I gave away to the natives belong to the Crown.
What comes back belongs to the Crown!
I'm not the most patient man in the world. Give them to me!
Remember, Mr. Bligh:
Crown property.
Very well, Mr. Christian. Crown property.
-Gratings rigged. -Everybody present?
-Everyone present, sir, but the surgeon. -Huh? The surgeon is ill, sir.
-Ill?
Drunk, you mean!
-We had to bleed him this morning, sir. He's not fit.
Mr. Morgan and Mr. Christian agree.
Go below. Tell him to report on deck at once!
Very good, sir.
Thomas Burkitt, Matthew Thompson, step forward.
Ship's company, off hats.
I'm sorry, sir.
Captain Bligh....
How do you feel?
I'm afraid I'm a very old man, lad...
-...and a very sick one. -I'lI tell him again you can't report.
No, boy. No, I'm not worth getting into a scrape over.
For once, a midshipman gives an order.
You stay where you are.
A good lad.
I must pull him out.
I've taken the liberty of telling the surgeon to stay. He's not able to report.
I'll have no drunken relic holding up the discipline aboard my ship.
Once more, bring him on deck, or I'Il have you seized up and flogged.
Byam doesn't wanna disobey you. I beg you, don't force the old man.
He can't walk.
-Go below and see for yourself. -Are you presuming to give me orders?
Reporting on deck for duty, sir.
Mr. Morrison, do your duty. Four dozen, I believe.
Four dozen it is, sir.
Nothing lost, Mr. Christian.
-Well?
-What did you expect, Mr. Bligh?
The man's dead.
I call this ship's company to bear witness. -You killed him!
-Silence.
Ship's company dismissed.
Boatswain, punishment postponed 24 hours.
Aye, aye, sir.
Do you hear, men?
Ship's company dismissed!
Bear a hand. Take him below.
Drunkard?
Yes, but everybody loved him.
The welfare of men on shipboard depends upon things that seem small.
A joke at the right moment.
A glass of grog.
A kind word would do more with seamen than the cat-o'-nine-tails.
And this ship will be the worse if possible, for his death.
Wonder if that's Defoe Island.
The natives are cannibals but it's land.
The last we'll see for months.
You'd better get some rest. You've been here for hours. No.
I can't sleep, and it's nearly my watch.
-Well, good night. -Roger.
-There's something I want you to do. -Gladly. What is it?
One never knows what may happen on a voyage like this.
If for any reason I don't return to England, I want you to see my parents.
Well, why shouldn't you return to England?
Why?
I can't stand this devil's work much longer.
One day I'll forget this discipline and break his neck.
Wait until we're back in England. The admiralty will save you the trouble.
Well, in any case, I'd like you to see my parents. -Of course.
Where do they live?
-In CumberIand at Maincordare.
I've almost forgotten what the old place looks like.
I haven't seen it in 10 years.
But I do remember a tapestry in the hall with ships and islands on it.
Perhaps that's what sent me off to sea.
I don't know.
In any case, I'd like you to see my home.
If anything should happen, tell my father and mother you knew me.
-You can count on me. Good. That's settled, then.
Mr. Byam, you're up late. -It's fairly warm below.
I hadn't noticed.
A true sailor can sleep in an oven or on ice. Get below.
Very good, sir.
Your watch, Mr. Christian.
And I must count the coconuts.
Mr. Christian, sir.
That shark's been following us since the surgeon died, waiting for the burial.
-Couldn't I have a musket to shoot it?
-Take the deck.
-I'lI get the keys to the arms chest. -Two muskets.
-I'd Iike to shoot that shark onboard. -McCoy!
It's no use. Now's our chance.
There's a lot of us here ready.
And the officers and men that won't join us....
-Well, it's them or us!
-Keep your hatch closed!
Now, get forward!
Who's there?
sailor hand, mate.
-Hey, what's this noise about here?
-Water, mate.
Water?
-For deserters?
-But the lad slipped his cable.
Well, here's to you slipping yours.
When I'm free, I'll wring your scrawny pipe stem till your tongue pops out!
Tongue, is it?
I'lI give you something to remind you of that slice of shark.
You scum!
Get out!
I'm sorry, lad.
Are you all right?
Thank you, Mr. Christian, sir.
Better take care of Thompson, sir.
Murdering butcher!
I've had enough of this blood ship!
He's not master of life and death on a quarterdeck above the angels.
McCoy!
Quintal!
I'm sick of blood!
Bloody backs!
Bloody faces!
Bligh, you've given your last command!
We'll be men again if we hang for it!
-You say you're ready for anything? -Aye!
-release them!
-You're taking the ship? Mutiny?
Yes, mutiny!
Pass the word.
Seize the arms chest.
We've been waiting for this!
Don't hit me!
Take him!
Boatswain!
No, no, don't hurt me!
Don't hurt me!
Now, wake up!
Get into your clothes and lose no time about it. -What's the matter?
-What's happened?
-Have we been attacked?
-No, we've taken the ship.
And old Bligh's a prisoner.
Mutiny?
Tie him to the pipe.
Mr. Morrison! Mr. Coleman!
Shut up or I'll shut your trap for you!
Give up this madness, or we'll all be murdered.
You're in no danger.
What will we do with him? -Shoot him!
-I'lI slit his dirty throat!
See that, you butcher?
My four dozen. We'll give you 400.
-We'Il let you know what it feels like!
Flog him!
You old rogue. You'd flog us. You'd make us eat grass.
You bluenosed baboon!
Back!
Back, all of you!
No more flogging aboard this ship. That's why we're taking it.
We'll have something to say about that!
What will you do with him?
Put him in a launch and cast him adrift. Give him food, water, cutlasses and a compass.
You can have your choice. Go with him or stay with me. No.
Slit his throat, I say, and feed him to the sharks.
And I say go forward!
Clear the launch and lower away!
Aye, aye, sir.
-Stand by, Thompson. -Aye, aye, sir.
Lively, old buzzing bees.
What a pity, what a pity!
Every little tree, perfect.
-You'Il be sure to water them?
-Never you fret. We'll water them.
We'lI take care of your plants, here, Morgan!
You may stay onboard if you Iike, without joining us.
No, thank you, sir.
All right. Your turn, Mr. Bligh.
Mr. Christian, I give you your last chance to return to duty.
I'll take my chance against the law. You'll take yours against the sea.
But you're taking my ship!
My ship!
Your ship?
The king's ship, you mean, and you're not fit to command it.
Into the boat!
We're ready, Churchill. Bear a hand here, will you?
McCoy!
McCoy!
Two little monkey jackets. Loyal to Captain Bligh, eh?
Serves them right. -Come on, lads, on deck.
I tell you, we will!
Mr. Christian, you forgot us.
Call back the boat.
There's no more room. You must stay with us.
-We'Il join our captain!
-We're not mutineers!
I said there was no more room!
Take them below!
Stand the guns on them!
Give them a drink!
Casting me adrift 3500 miles from a port of call.
You're sending me to my doom, eh?
Well, you're wrong, Christian!
I'll take this boat as she floats to England if I must!
I'll live to see you, all of you hanging from the highest yardarm in the British fleet!
Yardarms, is it?
I'll give you yardarms.
Burkitt!
You're not leaving them adrift?
They'll starve or drown.
-That's Bligh's affair. -Your friends, Morgan, Purcell--
Do you think I wanted this?
-call back the boat. -No.
-call it back!
-No!
These men have been in hell. I couldn't stand it.
-Then I must go with Bligh. -There's no room.
Then I call on you men.
All of you, in the name of the king, return to duty.
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Give me that gun!
Give me that!
Take him below.
Stand by to wear ship.
-What course, sir?
-West-northwest, Tahiti.
Tahiti, lads!
Hey, Thompson!
Here comes their water!
Sit down, Roger.
You know, there are five other men onboard who refused to take part in the mutiny.
They've agreed not to try and retake the ship.
You may have your liberty under the same conditions.
I simply want your word for it.
You may have it.
But I'll escape if I can.
I understand.
Then I may go?
Yes, you may go.
Roger I'm sorry I had to hit you.
That didn't hurt.
What hurts is that you and I can never again be friends.
Keep her as she goes, west-northwest.
West-northwest, sir.
I presume you'lI make for the nearest island. No.
That's certain death.
The savages in these parts are fierce cannibals. We must keep well clear of those fellas.
By my reckoning, the first port from which we can expect help is Timor in the Dutch East Indies, some 3500 miles away.
Then our case is hopeless.
It is by no means hopeless.
We have extra canvas, rope, a tool chest.
We'll put on every rag of sail.
That's impossible.
Deeply laden as we are, we'd fill with the first storm.
Then we'll bail with our hands if we must.
She'll see us through if we do our part, she will!
Begging your pardon, sir, but the food and the water.
We haven't got enough for 10 days.
If we are to reach Timor alive, we must make it last 20, 40, 50 days.
It's the sea against us.
Mr. Bligh, we'd be pleased if you'd ask God's blessing on our journey.
That I shall do, Mr. Fryer.
Almighty God, thou knowest our need.
Grant we acquit ourselves like men in the trials and dangers that lie before us.
ball!
ball!
ball faster!
ball faster!
Bail!
Another piece, Mr. Maggs.
Thank you.
Thank you, lad.
Are we all served?
All served, sir.
Now, lads, for your own good, eat and drink slowly.
How far have we still to go, sir?
Don't let your mind dwell upon that, lad.
Think how far we've come.
We'll never see Portsmouth again?
We'll see Portsmouth again and we'll see FIetcher Christian hanging from a yardarm and every pirate with him.
Steady, mates.
Steady.
Fryer, take the tiller. -Aye, sir.
Get away!
I caught him!
Hey, lads!
Give me that bird!
Share and share alike, lads.
The blood for the sick.
Raise him up, Mr. Maggs. Norton, get me a cup.
This will nourish you, Mr. Morgan.
No, thank you, sir.
Give it to the youngsters.
They need it more.
Yes, Mr. Morgan, but I'm still giving the orders.
Timor, up ahead.
Timor!
Up with you. Up with you.
We've beaten the sea itself.
I hope Master Roger has a nice Christmas, ma'am.
Thank you.
-Well, good night, ma'am. -Good night.
-Good night, ma'am. -Good night, ma'am.
I beg your pardon. will there be anything more?
-Nothing more, Burrows.
Christmas?
Yes, Christmas.
Peace on earth, goodwill to....
Come along.
A merry Christmas to you, Mrs. Christian.
Thank you, lads.
A merry Christmas to you all.
-Same to you, sir. -Merry Christmas, Mr. Christian.
Won't you come--?
-Roger!
-Merry Christmas, Fletcher.
Oh, thanks, lad. I've been hoping for this for a year.
Come in. This is a day worth celebrating.
Begging your pardon, sir.
We've brought the little lady a bit of Christmas.
Well, thanks, lad.
But she must have it from you.
Come in. Come in, lads, all of you.
Thank you, sir.
My boy was like that when I left home, sir.
He'lI be 3 years old now.
Come on, lads. Everybody outside for some grog.
Thank you, sir.
Isn't that a sweet baby?
Help yourself, lads!
Thank you, sir.
The surgeon's, Roger.
It would delight his soul to have us drink it, especially on this day.
Friend. Good, good.
Ah, Hitihiti, here.
Makes head go round, round.
Come on, Byrne, drink some of this!
Where's ElIison? Ellison!
Come on!
What?
A ship?
-Maybe she's Spanish. -No.
-No, she's British-rigged. -British?
Did you hear that, mate? British.
-British?
-She's coming for us.
We've got a chance. The wind's against her.
She must lay outside the reef till morning.
Get your families and your goods together!
Get aboard the Bounty!
Thompson, everyone onboard?
Burkitt and Muspratt have gone into hiding.
The fools!
They'll be taken and hanged.
Where are you taking us?
I don't know. The Pacific is filled with uncharted islands.
We'll find one and settle there for good.
Mr. Christian, I've got a wife and child in England.
I've got to get back.
Back?
You know what that means? A yardarm.
I must take that chance, sir.
But whatever happens, I'll never blame you.
Thanks, lad, and I understand. Good luck.
Well, this is goodbye, youngster.
We'll never see each other again, that's certain.
-But I'll remember. -I will too, Fletcher.
When you're back in England with the fleet you'lI hear the hue and cry against me.
From now on, they'll spell mutiny with my name.
I regret that but not the taking of the ship.
If ever I reach England again, I'll go to your father and tell him the truth.
Thanks.
-I'lI be happier knowing that. -Fletcher.
What is out there for you?
Another island.
-Stand by. I'll be back in a moment. -Hurry up, Byam.
When she comes around the headland, we'lI pilot her in.
Oh, Tehani, I'll be back in two hours.
Tehani knows.
The ship may be here for months before she sails.
But she will sail.
Byam, midshipman. Tehani knows.
Tehani, you're my wife, always.
Mrs. Roger Byam. My wife, my darling.
There she is, lads, and we've nothing to fear.
We took no part in the mutiny. Soon we'll be in England.
Thank God!
Thank God!
We're returning. Good, eh?
Very good, sir. My name's Byam, Roger Byam.
This is Mr. Stewart.
We're midshipmen of His Majesty's ship, Bounty.
Bring those men up!
Captain Bligh, thank God you're alive, sir.
They gave me a boat and a sail, didn't they?
Where is Fletcher Christian?
He sailed yesterday, sir, when your ship was sighted.
-Where to?
-I don't know, sir.
-You don't know, Stewart? -I don't know either.
You're lying, both of you.
Sergeant, put these men in irons.
-Irons? What for?
-Mutiny.
But we're not mutineers.
A court-martial in England will decide that.
-We're as loyal as you. -A court-martial will decide that!
We're reporting for duty!
If we're guilty, we'd go with Christian.
When Christian took my ship, you remained with him and you'll have to answer for it.
It'll be better to tell me where he's gone!
-We don't know, sir.
-Then you'll lie in the hold until you do know. Sergeant, take them below!
By the mark, 12!
Rocky bottom!
-To the lee helm. -Lee helm, sir.
-Steady!
-Steady, sir.
Mark 12!
-Foretop, any sail in sight?
-No sail, sir.
-Banktop!
-No sail, sir.
By the mark, 12!
Reefs ahead!
Mr. Byam, I can't understand why he keeps us below here in irons.
You and Mr. Stewart, McIntosh, Coleman, Byrne and myself we are no mutineers.
Haven't I told him that time and time again?
His marines surprised me and Muspratt, sir, or we wouldn't be here, alive.
Reefs ahead!
Attention below.
Have you decided to tell me where Christian sailed for?
By the mark, 12!
Reefs ahead!
Well, I'm waiting!
Well, stay here and rot.
My watch, I believe, Mr. Christian.
Very well, Mr. Young.
-You heathen slime!
I'm sorry, sir.
Mr. Christian, sir, when are you going to make a landfall?
We're fierce sick of this.
It's more than man can stand to be at sea forever in a ghost ship.
I've steered off the track of ships.
When it's safe, I'll put about for the island.
Until then you've got to trust me, that's all.
Deep 11. Rocky bottom!
I beg you again to give up the search.
The Bounty must be lost.
The ship's dragging barnacles. The seams are open.
Men are working the pumps day and night.
-We're still afloat, are we not?
-Only by the grace of God in these reefs.
-Ease her off a point. Ease her off a point, sir.
I must remind you this is one of His Majesty's ships.
Mr. Edwards, I intend to bring back Fletcher Christian.
Unless he's hanging from a yardarm, not one of His Majesty's ships is safe.
Mutiny and piracy will be rampant in the fleet.
-But we'll lose the ship. -Then we'll lose it!
As long as I have a deck under me, I'll search for that man.
Fourteen!
To starboard!
Old Bligh's a seaman.
The rocks are so thick, a fish couldn't swim between them... -...without rubbing off his scales.
By the mark, 8!
Let's hope we're moored before night or the sharks will have us.
By the mark, 2!
Breakers ahead.
Hard alee!
What's happened?
-Hard to port! -Very good, sir!
Haul out both of them!
Get the doors!
Captain Bligh!
Get us out!
We'll drown!
Lift with them and turn around!
Captain Bligh!
Let us out of here!
Save your voice, man!
Take charge of the aft boat.
Captain Bligh, get us out of here!
-Get those men out!
-Aye, aye, sir!
Hurry up, soldier!
-The first boat's ready. -Take them out.
Make for the Australian coast. Prisoners go with me in the other boat.
-Very good, sir. God be with you. -God be with you.
Hurry up with you down there.
Thank you. You saved our lives.
Mr. Byam, I wouldn't lose you for a flagship.
Get into the boat!
How long has this trial been going on?
About a week now. They should reach a verdict soon.
Oh, there, there, child.
But they won't let me see him. Why won't they let me see him?
If I could see him to talk to him, he'd know I trust him.
-He knows that, darling. -Oh, but it's cruel.
Cruel.
They can't hang him!
There's the signal. The trial is opened again.
On the 15th day of September, 1792 for mutiny on His Majesty's ship, Bounty.
Call Mr. Fryer.
Mr. Fryer.
Do you swear by God any evidence you give...?
Besides the leader, did you see any of the prisoners now before this court in arms?
Yes, milord. Inform the court.
Seaman Burkitt and Seaman Muspratt were armed with muskets.
Seaman Ellison was armed with a bayonet.
Have any of the accused any questions to put to this witness?
Yes, milord.
Good morning, Mr. Fryer.
Oh, good morning, lad.
Mr. Fryer, you say I was armed with a bayonet.
-Did you see me use it?
-By no means, lad.
Address your replies to the court.
-Milord, he didn't use the bayonet.
He merely flourished it under Captain Bligh's nose and called him a few names. Names?
What names did he call him?
Sir, he--
He called him a bluenosed baboon.
Have you any more questions to ask the witness?
No, milord.
That is all.
Milord, I should like to ask a few questions of Captain Bligh.
Very well, Captain nelson.
-call Captain Bligh. -Captain Bligh.
Captain Bligh, in the previous evidence given before this court you failed to make clear one very important point:
A motive for the mutiny.
Can you tell us why your men took your ship?
No, sir.
Until I was seized in the cabin, I suspected nothing.
A circumstance occurred the night before which should have aroused my suspicions.
Going on deck, I found Fletcher Christian and Roger Byam talking together at the rail.
I heard Roger Byam say, "You can count on me."
I heard Christian reply, "Good. That's settled."
I saw them shake hands.
I realized afterwards they were plotting to seize the Bounty.
But that's not true, Captain Bligh.
Milord, gentlemen, let me explain.
If the prisoner so desires, he may question the witness.
Captain Bligh, you've not repeated my whole talk with Fletcher Christian.
Did you not hear him tell me about his home in Cumberland?
I did not.
Well, did you not hear him ask my promise that if he did not return, I would tell his parents what had happened?
I did not.
I swear before God and before this court that was the content of my talk with Christian.
It had nothing to do with mutiny.
Captain Bligh, apart from the conversation you overheard was Mr. Byam's previous conduct such that you believe him guilty?
Sir, his entire conduct convinces me that he plotted with Christian.
They were friends before the mutiny. They remained friends after the mutiny.
When I arrived, the prisoner could've arrested Christian.
But he allowed him to escape. On his own admittance.
Yes, but you knew I was trapped on the island, perhaps for years.
Outnumbered, unarmed.
I gave my word to Christian not to move against him.
Mr. Byam, if you were loyal when Christian escaped I should have found you dead.
I have nothing more to ask him.
I can only say again to this court, I am not guilty of mutiny.
If that is so, why did you not join your captain when he was cast adrift?
I was below planning a counterattack to regain the ship from the mutineers.
With whom did you plan the attack?
Sir, with my messmate, Midshipman Stewart.
Milord Midshipman Stewart died in the Pandora's boat.
"The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want."
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
Can't they ever reach a verdict?
I'm that sick of waiting, I could stamp on a litter of wildcats and never feel a scratch.
Well, what are you looking at?
It ain't Tahiti. lt's only Portsmouth.
I thought she might row by in a boat.
Who, the queen?
No, my wife.
Sorry, lad.
Why can't I see her?
My wife, my boy that's all I've come back for.
I knew they'd hang me.
But I've got to see them. I've got to see them!
Blast these sea captains!
Who made their sea law?
God didn't. The burning killers! Lad!
We're all in the same boat, Tom.
They won't let me see my mother.
Won't you help us now by holding on?
Yes, sir.
Roger Byam?
Follow me, please.
-Sir Joseph. -My lad, they've reached a verdict.
-Watch the dirk. -The dirk?
The midshipman's dirk will be lying on the table before Lord Hood.
If it lies crosswise, you've been acquitted.
If the point lies toward you, you've been condemned.
God be with you.
Thank you, sir.
Prisoner and escort, halt. Left, hut.
Have you anything to say before the sentence of this court is passed upon you?
Milord, much as I desire to live, I'm not afraid to die.
Since I first sailed on the Bounty four years ago I've known how men can be made to suffer worse things than death.
Cruelly, beyond duty, beyond necessity.
Captain Bligh, you've told your story of mutiny on the Bounty.
How men plotted against you, seized your ship cast you adrift in an open boat.
A great venture in science brought to nothing. Two British ships lost.
But there's another story, Captain Bligh of 10 coconuts and two cheeses.
A story of a man who robbed his seamen, cursed them, flogged them.
Not to punish, but to break their spirit.
A story of greed and tyranny and of anger against it, of what it cost.
One man, milord, would not endure such tyranny.
That's why you hounded him.
That's why you hate him, hate his friends.
And that's why you're beaten.
Fletcher Christian's still free.
But Christian lost too, milord.
God knows he's judged himself more harshly than you could judge him.
I say to his father, he was my friend.
No finer man ever lived.
I don't try to justify his crime, his mutiny but I condemn the tyranny that drove him to it.
I don't speak here for myself alone, but for these men you've condemned.
I speak in their names and fletcher Christian's name for all men at sea.
These men don't ask for comfort. They don't ask for safety.
If they could speak to you, they'd say:
"Let us choose to do our duty willingly.
Not the choice of a slave, but that of free Englishmen."
They ask only the freedom that england expects for every man.
If one man among you believed that-- One man.
He could command the fleets of England.
He could sweep the seas for england.
If he called his men to their duty not by flaying their backs but by lifting their hearts their....
That's all.
Roger Byam, midshipman.
Having heard the evidence against you and having heard your own defense the sentence of this court is you shall suffer death by hanging onboard such of His Majesty's ships of war and at such time as the commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral of Great Britain and Ireland shall direct.
Prisoner and escort, into file.
Left, turn. Quick, hut.
I pronounce this court dissolved.
Milord, may I congratulate the court?
Captain Bligh, in my opinion, your open-boat voyage was the most remarkable conduct of navigation in the history of the sea.
I must admire your seamanship and courage, but....
Detachment, fall in.
Thanks, mate.
I've seen them, sir, thanks to you and your friends.
The wife, she's well, sir.
And the boy, blow me, I hardly knew him, he's growed so.
You wouldn't believe it, the dead spit of me.
I'm glad, Tom.
Look, sir.
Like the one she gave me the day we sailed for Tahiti.
Do you know, sir, that sailing seems like a dream.
As far away as the islands are.
I remember how Mr. Christian talked to me that day.
Cheered me up, he did.
Where do you think he is now, sir?
I'd give anything to know.
One thing's certain, he's taken that ship beyond maps.
I wonder if he found his island.
Well, sir, what did you find?
-Your new home, lads.
There she is, Pitcairn's Island.
There's no place to land. That's why I chose it.
I plan to run the Bounty in head-on, then burn her. -Burn her?
-We'd be fools to burn her. We'll be fools if we don't.
If there's one spar left in sight, we'lI never be safe.
Sir, we can't burn the ship. -We can never get back.
There's no way back, lad.
Once ashore, we're there to stay.
But this ship's our last tie with home.
Yon's a lonely rock to die on.
It's enough to live on. There's sun and earth and water.
It can be a hell or a home as we choose to make it.
We'll remember this as long as we live and regret it.
And remember why we took this ship.
They can't press-gang you there, they can't starve you, and can't flog you.
We're not afraid of a new life.
As long as we can live it with decency and self-respect, we can and we must.
For ourselves and our children.
Well, hands for burning?
-I say burn her, hull and sticks. Aye, aye.
Very well.
We'll get the women and children ashore and then stand by to take her in.
She makes a grand light, sir.
Good English oak.
Discipline has been maintained.
The mutineers who confessed have been punished.
But we're here to plead for the life of Roger Byam because we believe him innocent.
And there is more at stake here, Your Majesty, than his life.
We do not exaggerate when we say a new understanding between officers and men has come to the fleet.
By returning Byam to duty, Your Majesty will confirm that understanding.
And not for today only, but for all time to come.
Everyone aboard?
-The last shore boat's coming alongside. -Make ready for sea.
Very good, sir.
-Ship ready for sea, sir. -Very good.
Midshipman Byam, reporting for duty. -You take the mizzenmast, Byam. -Very good.
-Very glad to have you with us, lad. -Thank you, sir.
-May I, Byam? -Of course.
We're off to the Mediterranean, lad.
We'll sweep the seas for England.
- The gentleman has not arrived?
- No, he has not.
I'm afraid the dinner will be spoiled.
What difference does it make?
It's too late to dine now.
Boy, will you page Mr. Otis B. Driftwood, please?
Paging Mr. Driftwood!
Mr. Driftwood!
Do me a favor and stop yelling my name all over this restaurant.
- Do I go around yelling your name?
- Mr. Driftwood!
Is your voice changing, or is somebody else paging me?
- Mr. Driftwood!
- Why, Mrs. Claypool, hello!
You invited me to dine with you at 7:00.
It is now 8:00, and no dinner.
No dinner?
I just had one of the biggest meals of my life... and no thanks to you, either.
- I've been sitting right here since 7:00.
- With your back to me.
When I dine with a woman, I expect her to look at my face.
- That's the price she has to pay.
$9.40? This is an outrage!
If I were you, I wouldn't pay it.
- What are we gonna have for dinner?
- You've had your dinner.
All right, we'll have breakfast.
- Waiter!
- Yes, sir.
- Have you got any milk-fed chicken?
- Yes, sir.
Squeeze the milk out of one and bring me a glass.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Driftwood, three months ago, you promised to put me into society.
In all that time, you've done nothing but draw a very handsome salary.
You think that's nothing?
How many men do you think draw a handsome salary?
You can count them on the fingers of one hand, my good woman.
- I'm not your good woman!
- Don't say that, Mrs. Claypool.
I don't care what your past has been.
To me, you'll always be my good woman, because I love you.
There. I didn't mean to tell you but you dragged it out of me.
I love you.
That's hard to believe when I find you dining with another woman.
That woman?
Do you know why I sat with her?
Because she reminded me of you.
- Really? - Of course.
That's why I'm here with you, because you remind me of you.
Your eyes, your throat, your lips... Everything about you reminds me of you... except you.
How do you account for that?
She figures that out, she's good.
Mr. Driftwood, I think we'd better keep everything on a business basis.
Every time I get romantic with you, you want to talk business.
I don't know.
There's something about me that brings out the business in all women.
All right, we'll talk business.
You see that man eating spaghetti?
- No.
- You see the spaghetti, don't you?
Behind that spaghetti is none other than Herman Gottlieb... director of the New York Opera Company.
- Do you follow me?
- Yes.
Stop following me, or I'll have you arrested!
I've arranged for you to invest $200,000 in the New York Opera Company.
I don't understand.
Don't you see?
You'll be a patron of the opera.
You'll get into society.
You can marry me, and they'll kick you out of society... and all you've lost is $200,000.
Gottlieb. Allow me.
Mrs. Claypool, Mr. Gottlieb.
I could go on all night, but it's tough on my suspenders.
Where was I?
What are you doing?
If you four people want to play bridge, don't mind me, go right ahead.
Mrs. Claypool, I'm so happy.
I just wanted to see if your rings were still there.
You're as charming as you are beautiful.
I'm afraid you've used that speech before, Mr. Gottlieb.
Now listen here, Gottlieb, making love to Mrs. Claypool is my racket.
What you're after is $200,000.
Make it sound plausible, because incredible as it may seem...
Mrs. Claypool isn't as big a sap as she looks.
How's that for lovemaking?
I think the Europeans do it better.
All right, Gottlieb, it's your turn.
You take a whack at her... and keep it clean.
Mrs. Claypool, it is most generous of you to help us.
Now, you have, of course, heard of Rodolfo Lassparri.
- Of course.
- He is the greatest tenor since Caruso.
Tonight, with the money you so generously provide...
I sign Lassparri for the Opera Company.
He will be a sensation. All New York will be at your feet.
There's plenty of room.
And now, the opera awaits us.
If you both will honor me by occupying my box.
I should be charmed.
- And you, Mr. Driftwood?
- I'll join up with you later.
Listen, Gottlieb, nix on the lovemaking, because I saw Mrs. Claypool first.
Of course, her mother really saw her first, but why bring the Civil War into this?
What are you doing in my costume?
Take it off at once, do you hear?
Why, you...
Take that off.
Take off that dress, do you hear me?
You dumb idiot.
You do what I say, or I'll break your neck!
Do you hear me?
Take off that dress.
If I get my hands on you, you'll never hear the end of this!
You're no longer my dresser, you're fired!
Get out, do you hear me? Out you go.
And don't come back in here again.
Don't you care. You're lucky to be rid of him.
- Good evening, Rosa.
- Good evening, signore.
Tomasso, why don't you come in?
I've been waiting for you.
Are they not beautiful, signorina?
From Signor Lassparri.
I wouldn't wear them if they were the only flowers in the world.
- Come in!
- Not if you use that tone.
Let's try the whole thing all over again. Only this time, try to be more cordial.
- Come in.
- That's better. Let's try it once more.
No, Ricky. You're such a fool.
- What was it you wanted to see me about?
- I suppose I sent for you?
You meant to. Didn't she, Marie?
It's the last night of the season, and I'm more in love with you than ever.
- What will you do about it?
- We have all summer to talk that over.
- Tonight, we have to sing an opera.
- You have to sing an opera.
- I'm nothing but a glorified chorus man.
- Don't say that.
I've got to say it. I've got something else to say.
What are you doing tonight, unless that ham Lassparri asked you first.
- He has asked me first.
- Just my luck.
But I'm having supper with you, Riccardo.
Hooray!
We'll have champagne, music, flowers...
"Lassparri."
No flowers.
- Fiorello!
- Tony!
- Where have you been all these weeks?
- Here, there, different places.
- Got some mail for me?
- Mail for you?
You don't work here.
Where am I gonna get my mail?
I no work anyplace.
Tomasso!
Not so good. Don't be so glad.
I brought you present. You got something for me, too?
What do you got?
Where's Riccardo? All right.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were with the circus.
The circus?
When was I with the circus?
I nearly forgot. That was a long time ago, last week.
Since then I have lots of jobs.
Your piano and my voice.
All those years we studied at the conservatory, and what's come of it?
What's a matter with you?
We're still young. We've got our health.
You hear that?
Someday, Riccardo, you're gonna be where Lassparri is.
When you were six years old, you sing better than Lassparri.
Maybe I was better at six than I am now.
You make me sick. You crazy.
You sing better than he ever could sing and you know it.
I know it and you know it, but the public doesn't know it.
- All right. We tell the public.
- How?
What you need is a manager.
A wise guy, somebody who's very smart.
- I know just the man for you.
- You do?
Who is it?
Me!
- But you wouldn't make any money at it.
- I'll break even.
Just as long as I no lose nothing.
- Is the opera over yet?
- Not yet, signore, in a few minutes.
I told you to slow that nag down.
On account of you, I nearly heard the opera.
Once around the park, and drive slowly.
And none of your back talk.
You're still crazy about her?
And she's crazy about you, too?
Even if she was, I couldn't ask her to marry me.
Don't worry. The manager, he'll fix everything.
Anyhow, we're together again...
- you and me, just like old times.
- Yeah, like old times.
Yeah, you bet my life.
If you pardon my saying so, Mrs. Claypool...
Mr. Driftwood seems hardly the person to handle your business affairs.
- I'm beginning to think the same thing.
I made it. How soon does the curtain go up?
The curtain, Mr. Driftwood, will go up again next season.
- You've missed the entire opera.
- I only missed it by a few minutes.
I can go then?
Was I right?
Isn't Lassparri the greatest tenor that ever lived?
He's superb. But what would you have to pay him?
What's the difference?
He must sail with us tomorrow no matter what we pay.
- He would be worth $1,000 a night.
- How much?
- What does he do?
- What does he do, he sings.
You're willing to pay him $1,000 a night just for singing?
You can get a phonograph record of Minnie the Moocher for 75 cents.
For $1.25, you can get Minnie.
If you'll excuse me, Mrs. Claypool...
I think I had better arrange to see Lassparri immediately.
- You are agreed, $1,000 a night?
- Just as you think.
$1,000. There must be some way I can get a piece of this.
Wait. Why don't I sign Lassparri?
I represent Mrs. Claypool.
But I represent the New York Opera Company.
Boy?
Will you give my card to Signor Lassparri, please?
What is it?
What do you want?
- Rosa.
- Yes, signore?
My good friend Herman Gottlieb is coming back to see me.
How would you like to have supper with us?
I'm terribly sorry, Signor Lassparri, I already have an engagement.
I see.
That's too bad, because I have an idea... he's going to invite me to sing in New York.
And he may permit me to select my leading lady.
Are you sure you can't break your appointment?
I'm terribly sorry, signore.
What do you mean by humiliating me in front of those people?
You're fired, do you understand?
You big bully, why are you hitting that little bully?
Will you kindly let me handle my own affairs?
Get out. What do you got to say to me?
Can you sleep on your stomach with such big buttons on your pajamas?
Why, you...
Nice work, I think you got him.
Smelling salts. That will bring him to.
You're sorry for what you did?
That shows a nice spirit.
Now he's coming along. He'll be fine now.
- Get fresh with me, huh?
- How do you do?
- Hello.
- What's the matter, mister?
We had an argument. He pulled a knife on me, so I shot him.
- Do you mind if I...
- Go right ahead. Plenty of room.
- Two beers, bartender.
- I'll take two beers, too.
Things seem to be getting better around the country.
I don't know. I'm a stranger here myself.
I came back here looking for somebody. You don't know who it is, do you?
It's a funny thing, it just slipped my mind.
I know. The greatest tenor in the world. That's what I'm after.
- Why, I'm his manager.
- Whose manager?
The greatest tenor in the world.
- The fellow that sings at the opera here?
- Sure.
What's his name?
What do you care?
I can't pronounce it. What do you want with him?
I want to sign him up for the New York Opera Company.
Do you know that America is waiting to hear him sing?
He can sing loud but he can't sing that loud.
I think I can get America to meet him halfway.
Could he sail tomorrow?
You pay him enough money, he could sail yesterday.
How much you pay him?
I don't know. Let's see, $1,000 a night.
I'm entitled to a small profit.
- How about $10 a night?
- $10?
I'll take it.
All right, but remember, I get 10% for negotiating the deal.
Yes, and I get 10% for being the manager.
How much does that leave?
Well, that leaves him $8.
- He sends $5 home to his mother.
- That leaves $3.
Can he live in New York on $3?
Like a prince.
Of course, he won't be able to eat, but he can live like a prince.
However, out of that $3, he'll have to pay an income tax.
Yes, there's a federal tax, a state tax, and a city tax... a street tax, and a sewer tax.
How much does this come to?
I figure if he doesn't sing too often, he can break even.
- All right, we take it.
- All right, fine.
Here are the contracts.
You just put his name at the top, and you sign at the bottom.
No need of you reading that because these are duplicates.
Yeah. Is a duplicate.
- Duplicates?
- I say, they're duplicates.
- Don't you know what duplicates are?
- Sure, those five kids up in Canada.
I wouldn't know about that. I haven't been in Canada in years.
Go ahead and read it.
- What does it say?
- Go on and read it.
- You read it.
- All right, I'll read it to you.
- Can you hear?
- I haven't heard anything yet.
- You say anything?
- I haven't said anything worth hearing.
That's why I didn't hear anything.
That's why I didn't say anything.
- Can you read?
- I can read, but I can't see it.
Don't seem to have it in focus here.
If my arms were a little longer, I could read it.
You haven't got a baboon in your pocket, have you?
Here we are. Now I've got it.
Pay particular attention to this first clause because it's most important.
It says, " The party of the first part shall be known in this contract...
"as the party of the first part."
How do you like that?
That's pretty neat, eh?
No, it's no good.
- What's the matter with it?
- I don't know.
"The party of the first part shall be known in this contract...
"as the party of the first part."
Sounds a little better this time.
It grows on you. Would you like to hear it once more?
Just the first part.
What? "The party of the first part"? No.
The first part of "the party of the first part."
It says, " The first part of the party of the first part...
"shall be known in this contract as the first part of the party...
"Shall be known in this contract..."
Why should we quarrel about this?
We'll take it out.
Yeah. It's too long anyhow.
Now what do we got left?
I got about a foot and a half.
It says, " The party of the second part shall be known in this contract...
"as the party of the second part."
I don't know about that.
- Now what's the matter?
- I don't like the second party either.
You should have come to the first party. We didn't get home till around 4:00 a.m.
I was blind for three days.
Why can't the first part of the second party... be the second part of the first party?
Look, rather than go through that again, what do you say...
Fine.
I've got something you're bound to like. You'll be crazy about it.
No. I don't like it.
- You don't like what?
- Whatever it is, I don't like it.
Don't let's break up an old friendship over a thing like that. Ready?
Okay.
The next part, I don't think you're going to like.
Your word's good enough for me. Is my word good enough for you?
- I should say not.
- That takes out two more clauses.
- "The party of the eighth part..."
- No, that's no good.
- "The party of the ninth..."
- No, that's no good, too.
How is it my contract is skinnier than yours?
I don't know, you must have been out on a tear last night.
- We're all set now, aren't we?
- Sure.
Just you put your name down there, and then the deal is legal.
I forgot to tell you, I can't write.
That's all right, there's no ink in the pen.
- But it's a contract, isn't it?
- Sure.
We've got a contract, no matter how small it is.
Wait. What does this say here?
That?
That's the usual clause.
That's in every contract.
That just says, " If any of the parties... "participating in this contract...
"are shown not to be in their right mind...
"the entire agreement is automatically nullified."
I don't know.
It's all right. That's in every contract.
That's what they call a sanity clause.
You can't fool me. There ain't no Sanity Claus.
You win the white carnation.
- I'll give this to Riccardo.
...sensation in New York.
Could you tell me where Signor Lassparri is?
Sure. There's Lassparri.
Lassparri?
Then whom did I sign?
You signed Riccardo Baroni. That's my man.
Signor Lassparri, what happened?
Speak to me. It's me, it's Gottlieb.
What is this now?
How early the fruit is falling this season.
- Are you sure you have everything, Otis?
- I've never had any complaints yet.
Here you are, on your way to America and fame.
Riccardo, I'm going to miss you.
How do you think I feel about it?
Miss Castaldi, ready for the big trip?
Mr. Gottlieb. This is Riccardo Baroni of the Opera Company.
- How do you do?
- Did you say Baroni?
Is it as funny as all that?
Mr. Otis B. Driftwood seems to think you have quite a voice.
He has, Mr. Gottlieb, really he has, a wonderful voice.
- Yes, really I have.
- That's interesting.
- Come on, Riccardo.
- No, thanks.
Come on, Ricky!
- Signor Lassparri.
- Yes?
- Will you give us a farewell song?
- Please!
Come on!
My dear friends, I am so sorry, I must be excused... but I have a slight touch of laryngitis.
- Where's Rosa?
- Yes, Rosa!
Why should I sing for them when I'm not being paid for it?
- Please sing.
- No.
Yes, of course I'll sing.
Mr. Gottlieb.
Hasn't he a wonderful voice?
There must be a place for him in New York.
Not a bad voice.
Someday, perhaps, when he has made a reputation.
All visitors ashore!
Rosa!
We've come to say goodbye.
All right. Goodbye. Arrivederci.
Come on!
- All right, take it away.
Have I got time to go back and pay my hotel bill?
- Sorry. Too late.
- That suits me fine.
That's mine. A trunk thief?
- Where you going with that?
- Suite number 58, sir.
Fifty-eight?
That's me. Let's go.
What's the idea?
Hit-and-run driver?
I'm sorry, sir.
Sorry, my eye. Look at that fender. It's all bumped out of shape.
You'll pay for this, my good man. Let me see your number.
Thirty-two?
You got any insurance?
- What?
- Are you insured?
- No, sir.
- You're just the fellow I want to see.
I have an accident policy that protects you no matter what happens.
If you lose a leg, we'll look for it. All this will cost you is...
What have you got there?
$1. Here you are.
Let's go.
Suite 58, and don't go over 20 miles an hour.
Say, was that three fellows or one fellow with three beards?
Hi, Gottlieb, always beating around the bush.
Wait a minute.
Anything I can do?
- Just a little homesick.
- That's funny.
I happen to have the greatest prescription for homesickness you ever saw.
A fellow gave it to me just before the boat sailed.
Here's the prescription, and take it every two hours.
I'm going out and getting another prescription.
- Hello, toots.
- Hello.
- Say, pretty classy layout you got here.
- Do you like it?
Twin beds. You little rascal, you.
- One of those is a day bed.
- A likely story.
Have you read any good books lately?
Mr. Driftwood, will you please get off the bed?
- What would people say?
- They'd say you're a very lucky woman.
Will you please shut up so I can continue reading?
No, I will not shut up. And will you kindly get up at once?
All right, I'll go. I'll make you another proposition.
Let's go in my room and discuss the situation.
- What situation?
- What situations have you got?
- I most certainly will not go to your room.
- Okay. Then I'll stay here.
All right.
I'll come, but get out.
Shall we say 10 minutes?
Yes, 10 minutes. Anything, but go.
Because if you're not there in 10 minutes, I'll be back here in 11.
With squeaky shoes on.
- Wait a minute. This can't be my room.
- Yes, sir.
Suite number 58, sir.
Fifty-eight?
That's an awful big number for a birdcage this size.
Wouldn't it be simpler if you just put the stateroom in the trunk?
Say, who is responsible for installing me in this telephone booth?
Mr. Gottlieb picked it out for you, sir.
Gottlieb?
That's awfully decent of him. Awfully decent.
Did he pick out the whole room or just the porthole?
- I'm sure you'll find it cozy, sir.
- Cozy is hardly the word.
Anything else, sir? Yes.
Tomorrow you can take the trunk out and I'll go in.
Yes, sir.
- Hello, boss. What are you doing here?
- Hello.
This makes it a perfect voyage.
- I'm sorry. I thought this was my trunk.
- It is your trunk.
I don't remember packing you boys.
Remember Riccardo Baroni, the greatest tenor in the world?
You nearly signed him up once.
Sure. I just delivered a letter for you. How are you?
- Good. Just a little cramped.
- We're still in the harbor.
As soon as we get out in the ocean, there'll be plenty of room.
- Isn't that my shirt?
- I don't know. I found it in the trunk.
Then it couldn't be mine. It's nice seeing you again.
But I was expecting my other suit. Did you see it? Yeah.
Took up too much room, so we sold it.
- Did you get anything for it?
- $1.40.
That's my suit, all right. Say, it's lucky I left another shirt in this drawer.
That can't be my shirt. My shirt doesn't snore.
Don't wake him up. He's got insomnia. He's sleeping it off.
That's as grisly a looking object as I've ever seen.
Get him up out of there.
He certainly is sleeping.
I wish you fellows would explain this thing to me.
It's very simple. You see, Riccardo, he's in love with Rosa.
Rosa, she go to New York. We want to go to New York, too.
But we got no money, so we hide in the trunk.
Without money, what'll you do in New York?
I can sing. There must be some place for me to work.
Besides, I can be near Rosa. That's the main thing.
You won't give us away, will you?
No, but you fellows have got to get out of here.
I've got a date with a lady in a few minutes... and you know the old saying:
"Two's company, five's a crowd." We go, but we want something to eat. We no eat all day.
We'll discuss the food situation later.
We get food, or we don't go.
I know I never should have met you fellows.
Okay. But promise to scram out after you've eaten.
- All right.
- I'll get the steward.
You fellows be quiet. Remember, you're stowaways.
- We no say nothing. - All right.
Now, just put that bag of Jell-O over here.
Wouldn't it be simpler if you had him stuffed?
- He's no olive.
- I'll go and get the steward.
Is it the door of the room, or am I in the trunk?
Over here.
Be quiet, now. Don't make any noise.
- We no say nothing.
- I'll get the steward.
Steward!
- Stew! - Yes, sir.
- I say, stew...
- Yes, sir.
- What's for dinner?
- Anything you like.
Tomato juice, orange juice, grape juice, pineapple juice...
Turn off the juice before I get electrocuted.
All right, let me have one of each.
And two fried eggs, two poached eggs... two scrambled eggs, and two medium-boiled eggs.
And two hard-boiled eggs.
And two hard-boiled eggs.
Make that three hard-boiled eggs.
And some roast beef: Rare, medium, well-done, and overdone.
And two hard-boiled eggs.
Make that three hard-boiled eggs.
And eight pieces of French pastry.
- With two hard-boiled eggs.
- And two hard-boiled eggs.
Make that three hard-boiled eggs.
And one duck egg.
- Have you got any stewed prunes?
Give them some black coffee. That'll sober them up.
And two hard-boiled eggs.
It's either foggy out, or make that 12 more hard-boiled eggs.
Rush that along. The faster it comes, the faster this convention will be over.
Yes, sir.
- Do they allow tipping on the boat?
- Yes, sir!
- Have you got two fives?
- Yes, sir.
Then you won't need the 10 cents I was gonna give you.
That's fine. If that steward is deaf and dumb...
- he'll never know you're in here.
- That's all right.
- Yes?
- We've come to make up your room.
- Are those my hard-boiled eggs?
- I can't tell until they get in the room.
Come in, girls. Leave all hope behind.
Work fast because you gotta get out in 10 minutes.
Tomasso. Wake up. They're going to fix the bed.
I'd like two pillows on that bed there.
There's a slight misunderstanding here.
I said the girls had to work fast, not your friend.
He's still asleep.
You know, he does better asleep than I do awake.
Yeah, he always sleeps that way.
- Now he's half-asleep.
- Yes, he's half-asleep in a half Nelson.
- All right, come on.
I'm the engineer. I'm here to turn off the heat.
You can start right in on him.
Wake up, Tomasso.
Tomasso, we're going to eat soon.
You know, if it wasn't for Gottlieb, I wouldn't have got this room.
Just hold him there a second.
- Yes?
- Did you want a manicure?
No. Come on in.
I hadn't planned on a manicure, but on a journey like this... you ought to have every convenience you can get.
Listen, I'm getting the manicure. Get out of here, will you?
Did you want your nails long or short?
You better make them short.
I don't know. This isn't the way I pictured an ocean voyage.
I always visualized myself in a steamer chair with a steward bringing me bouillon.
Come on, Riccardo.
You couldn't get bouillon in unless they brought it in through a keyhole.
I'm the engineer's assistant.
I had a premonition you were going to show up.
The engineer's over there in the corner. You can chop your way right through.
Is it my imagination, or is it getting crowded in here?
I got plenty of room.
- Yes?
- Is my Aunt Minnie in here?
You can come in and prowl around if you want to.
If she isn't in here, you can probably find somebody just as good.
- Could I use your phone?
- Use the phone?
- I'll lay you even money you can't get in.
- How do you do?
This boat will be in New York before you get to that phone.
I came to mop up.
Just the woman I'm looking for. Come right ahead.
You have to start on the ceiling. It's the only place that's not occupied.
- You can clean my shoes if you want to.
- Operator.
Tell Aunt Minnie to send up a bigger room, will you?
- Steward.
- Come right ahead.
- The food!
- We've been waiting all afternoon for you.
I want my Aunt Minnie!
Ladies and gentlemen... it's with great pleasure I welcome you all on this, the final night of the voyage.
I cannot let the evening pass... without paying a little tribute to our distinguished guests of honor:
The three greatest aviators in the world.
Three greatest aviators, but notice they're traveling by boat.
We are honored by your presence, gentlemen.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Captain.
- Do you rumba?
- Why, yes.
Of course I do.
Take a rumba from one to ten.
Mr. Claypool went to his reward three years ago.
- And left you all alone.
- All alone.
With $8 million.
$8 million.
Gottlieb, you're just wasting your time.
If Mrs. Claypool wants to marry a fortune hunter, she's got me.
Fortune hunter?
In fact, you can't call me a fortune hunter.
Because when I proposed to her, I thought she only had $7 million.
But the extra million never interfered with my feelings for her.
If you had any real feeling for me... you'd stop associating with the riffraff I've seen you with.
You mean Gottlieb?
I mean those two uncouth men I saw you around the opera house with.
I'm grateful they're not on board the boat.
- Why, have they slipped off?
- Sit down.
Come on, we find something to eat.
You think it's safe?
If they catch us, they'll deport us.
What will we lose?
If we're deported, they'll feed us.
Come on, we'll take a chance.
Does it mean nothing to you that I'm the world's greatest singer?
- But I love to hear you sing, Rodolfo. - No.
Let me put it this way. I love you.
I adore you. I would die for you.
- Now do you understand?
- I'm afraid I don't.
The whole thing is very simple.
When he says he's the greatest singer, it means he loves you.
Personally, I don't believe either statement.
There may be something in what you say.
I'll tell you something confidentially.
The only tenor I could ever stand was a fellow by the name... of Riccardo Baroni.
- Ever hear of him?
- Riccardo.
I wonder where he is right now.
Probably roaming over the countryside someplace.
Riccardo always loved the open. He never could stand being cooped up.
He still doesn't like it.
Tomasso, you feel better now?
And, you, Riccardo, how do you feel?
After a meal like that?
Great. I could sing my head off.
That's the spirit.
Stop that!
Get away from those instruments!
- What are you doing here?
- Please let him play.
Let him play.
It's all right with me. Let him play.
Those men can't be passengers on this boat.
- They must be stowaways.
- Stowaways?
We'll soon find out.
What are you...
Are you crazy?
You got it. Fine. Now you go first and see if it's safe.
Come on. Hold on. Out you go.
You're all right, but the boat's too far away.
What's he doing now?
I think he's hanging himself.
- Gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to...
- Quiet.
Our guests have asked me to represent them and to act as their interpreter.
If you'll follow me, I'll take you to their cabin.
If they're still in it, very few of us will come out alive.
Pardon me. Our guests are having their shredded wheat.
They'll be right out.
Gentlemen.
- "Kind friends..." - Give me that.
Let's cut this short.
The whole thing is very simple. You're going to City Hall.
The Mayor's gonna make another speech.
We can tear up the Mayor's speech when we get there.
So, my friends, as mayor of this great city...
I take pleasure in inviting our distinguished visitors... to tell us something about their achievement.
What'll I say?
- Tell them you're not here.
- Suppose they don't believe me?
They'll believe you when you start talking.
Friends...
Talk fast. I see a man in the crowd with a rope.
How we happen to come to America is a great story, but I no tell that.
When we first started out... we got no idea you give us this grand reception.
We don't deserve it.
When I say we don't deserve it... believe me, I know what I'm talking about.
That's a novelty.
Now I tell you how we fly to America.
The first time, we get halfway across when we run out of gasoline.
We got to go back.
Then I take twice as much gasoline.
This time, we were just about to land, maybe 3 feet... when, what do you think, we run out of gasoline again.
Back we go and get more gas.
This time, I take plenty gas.
We get halfway over, when what do you think happened?
We forgot the airplane.
So we sit down and talk it over.
Then I get the great idea... we no take gasoline.
We no take the airplane.
We take steamship.
And that, friends, is how we fly across the ocean.
I'm going out to arrange your bail.
This is the mayor again.
And now I take great pleasure in introducing another of our heroes... who will tell you something of his exploits.
Of course.
From now on, it's every man for himself.
I would suggest you make your speech a little more direct than your brother's.
What will you give me to set fire to your beard?
We're all right as long as the water supply holds out.
Please, the radio. Your speech.
They may have to build a dam in the back of him.
I think these fellas are phonies.
- What's that you say?
- You heard me.
You hear what they say?
They've never been so insulted, and they refuse to stay.
No, please. Tell them he didn't mean it.
Of course, you know this means war.
Now see what you've done.
I'm sorry. I'm awful sorry.
I apologize, and I hope you're not offended.
Go on!
After him!
Come on, get him.
What are you singing about?
What will you do?
First, I'll throw those two gorillas out. That goes for you, too.
Thought I got rid of those mugs when I sold my trunk.
Kiddies, come on, everything is piping hot.
Breakfast.
- Good morning.
- Oh, boy, I'm hungry.
Read that. That will take away your appetite.
No. That only makes me hungrier.
Come on. You're going to be late for jail.
Those certainly went like hot cakes.
You know, this isn't the way I anticipated my breakfast.
I'm certainly getting enough of you fellas.
- I no like cupcakes.
- No.
I know when I've had enough...
Say, wait a minute. That was a two-bit cigar.
Bad enough I have to smoke those things without eating them.
Get out.
Glad I didn't bring my vest.
I forgot to tell you. He ate your vest last night for dessert.
He's half goat.
Yes, and that's giving him all the best of it.
Thought I had another cigar on me.
He's going to smell like a vegetable salad when he gets through with that.
I've been looking forward to this breakfast.
I've been waiting all morning.
This is how it wound up.
- I'll take a quart.
- A little of that, anyway.
Why don't you fellows be nice?
Get out of here before I get arrested.
I'd like to stay and see that.
What's that?
If it's a policeman, knock once more.
- That's good enough for me.
- Scram, get out.
Come in.
- Yes?
- You remember me.
I'm Henderson, plainclothesman.
You look more like an old clothes man to me.
- Nice place.
- It's comfortable.
You live here all alone?
Yes. Just me and my memories.
- I'm practically a hermit.
- A hermit.
I notice the table is set for four.
That's nothing. My alarm clock is set for 8:00.
That doesn't prove a thing.
A wise guy.
I'll take a little look around.
- Hey, you.
- Coming.
What's a hermit doing with four beds?
- You see those first three beds? - Yes.
Last night, I counted 5,000 sheep on those beds.
So I had to have another bed.
You wouldn't want me to sleep with the sheep, would you?
- Who are you talking to?
- I was talking to myself.
There's nothing you can do about it.
- I've had three of the best doctors.
- I certainly heard somebody talk.
- Sheer folly on your part.
- What's this?
That's a fire escape.
That's a table. This is a room.
There's the door leading out. I wish you would use it.
- I want to be alone.
- You'll be alone when I throw you in jail.
Isn't there a song like that, Henderson?
Look out. He's coming around the other way.
Get inside, quick.
It means a stretch at the big house if he catches you.
Don't let him catch you.
- Hey, you!
- Coming.
What became of that fourth bed?
What are you referring to, Colonel?
Last time I was in this room, there were four beds here.
Please. I'm not interested in your private life, Henderson.
Say, what's that bed doing here?
I don't see it doing anything.
There's something funny going on here. But I'll get to the bottom of it.
Stairs right there.
Look out!
- Be on your guard.
- Hey, you!
Coming.
Am I crazy, or are there only two beds here?
Which question do you want me to answer first?
How did those two beds get together?
You know how those things are. They breed like rabbits.
Let me tell you something.
I'll solve this if I have to stay here all night.
- If you stay, you'll have to bring a bed.
- One bed!
One bed?
What are you talking about?
Now they're all gone. I know I am crazy.
I beg your pardon, I must be in the wrong room.
You thought you could come to America without me?
You fool. You dear fool.
Because I love you, you call me a fool. There may be something in that.
- What are you doing here?
- Easiest thing in the world.
An open window, a detective, and here I am.
Riccardo, you shouldn't have.
They'll only send you back again.
- Perhaps even put you in jail.
- I don't care, darling. It's worth it.
Suppose I go to Mr. Gottlieb. Maybe he'd intercede for you.
Gottlieb couldn't do anything. Besides, Lassparri's got to him first.
But there must be something we can do.
- Who is it?
- It is I. Rodolfo.
Come in.
Do you mind my dropping down?
No, of course not. Only, I was just going to take a nap.
- Rosa, why do you do this to me?
- Do what, Rodolfo?
Whenever I want to see you, you make some excuse.
You will not dine with me, ride with me, or even take a walk with me.
But, Rodolfo, you know how busy I am.
My debut in America.
Have you forgotten that it was I... who brought about your debut in America?
No, I haven't forgotten.
Then why do you treat me this way?
Rodolfo, I must ask you to leave.
Come now, my dear. Be sensible.
If you ask me, I think she's being very sensible.
Baroni.
Now I understand.
You did not tell me you had a previous engagement.
Now you know it.
And I apologize.
Now, permit me to withdraw.
In a boudoir, two are company, three a crowd.
- Just what do you mean by that?
- Please, Riccardo.
Surely I have made my meaning clear.
Riccardo!
You have not heard the end of this.
- I'm sure I haven't.
- You may be very sure.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Driftwood.
- Good afternoon.
- Ready for the opening tonight?
- Am I?
That's all right, boys. I was young myself once.
Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Driftwood.
- How are all my songbirds?
- Fine.
Splendid. Sing well tonight, now.
Waiting for you, Mr. Driftwood. Step right in.
Thank you, Otto.
- Nice day, isn't it?
- It has its points.
Here you are, sir.
- Thank you, Otto.
- That's all right, Mr. Driftwood.
What's all this?
What's going on here?
You mean, what's coming off here?
- You can't do that.
- Wanna bet?
But that's my office.
I'm taking orders from Mr. Gottlieb. Go see him about it.
I'll see Mr. Gottlieb, and I'll break you, my fine fellow.
Go see Mr. Gottlieb.
What's the meaning of this?
If you think that I'm going to...
If you're busy, I'll return later.
Just a minute, Mr. Driftwood. We have some news for you.
News?
For me?
Mrs. Claypool has decided to dispense with your services immediately.
Dispense with my services?
She hasn't even had them.
I warned you, if you continued to associate with those men... everything would be over between us.
And you've been associating with them.
How do you know?
You couldn't find them.
You've disgraced me, and the entire Opera Company.
As Mrs. Claypool's new business manager...
I must request you to get out and stay out.
Just a minute. You can't fire me without two weeks' salary.
That's in section 10-A of my contract.
I find that you have overdrawn your salary for the next six months.
- In that case, I'll take one week's salary.
- You'll take nothing. Get out.
If that's your best offer, I'll get out, but I'm not making a nickel on it.
As for you, Mrs. Claypool, I withdraw my offer of marriage.
And that goes for you, too.
The thanks I get for working my fingers to the bone.
- All right, Otto.
- Just a minute.
This car is for officials. Take the stairs.
- The stairs?
- Yeah.
Why, that's four flights. I can't walk all that distance.
All right. I'll help you.
- Now there's room.
- That's all I needed.
I'm certainly glad I met you boys.
First you get me fired, then you get me thrown out of my hotel... and finally you push me off a park bench.
There's one consolation. Nothing more can happen to me.
Get off of the grass.
I was wrong.
People drink too much water, anyhow.
I'm certainly glad you came along.
When I met you boys, I had a good job and was about to marry a rich widow.
Now I can't even sit on the grass.
I'd give you my seat, but I'm sitting here.
That's an offer. I'd like to think it over for a couple of days.
Where can I find you?
Don't worry. Wherever you are, you'll find us.
I'm sick of that. Let's meet somewhere else.
It's Rosa.
At least I can get my bench back.
Don't feel so badly, Riccardo.
I can't feel cheerful about being such a hoodoo to you.
We all make things bad for you.
What's the matter?
What do you think?
Lassparri. He's get Rosa fired.
- Lassparri?
- He won't let her sing tonight.
What do you know about that?
We've got all day to think of some plan.
And believe me, the way I think, it'll take all day.
- Good evening, Tim.
- Good evening.
Plenty for you tonight.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.
What does this mean?
Just the man I want to see.
Gottlieb, these are the worst cigars I ever smoked.
Yes, and your ice isn't cold enough, either.
Get out of here, all of you. I shall send for the police.
Just a minute. I'll tell you what we came here for.
We make you a proposition.
So you're willing to give yourselves up?
Yes, if you let Rosa sing.
I'm managing director, and Rosa does not sing.
But the rest of your proposition... giving yourselves up, that rather appeals to me.
Give me police headquarters. Sergeant Henderson, please.
Hello, toots.
What are you doing here?
This is Mr. Gottlieb's box.
He couldn't come, so he gave me his ticket.
And he couldn't get dressed, so he gave me his clothes.
Shorty, will you toss up that kelly?
Attaboy.
Here.
Get yourself a stogy.
Who's ahead?
Open the door.
Get me police headquarters.
Mrs. Claypool, have you seen Mr. Gottlieb?
No. Isn't he backstage?
He's disappeared. We can't find him anywhere.
You didn't look in the right place.
He was to make a speech before the curtain went up.
That's the cue. You'd better say something.
But I never made a speech in my life.
- All right, I'll take care of it.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I guess that takes in most of you.
This is the opening of a new opera season.
A season made possible by the generous checks of Mrs. Claypool.
I'm sure the familiar strains of Verdi's music will come back to you tonight... and Mrs. Claypool's checks will probably come back in the morning.
Tonight marks the American debut of Rodolfo Lassparri.
Signor Lassparri comes from a very famous family.
His mother was a well-known bass singer.
His father was the first man to stuff spaghetti with bicarbonate of soda... thus causing and curing indigestion at the same time.
Now, on with the opera. Let joy be unconfined.
Let there be dancing in the streets... drinking in the saloons, and necking in the parlor.
Play, Don.
I'll take this side.
It's none of my business... but I think there's a brace of woodpeckers in the orchestra.
Don't give up, boys. The cavalry is coming.
- I'll see you later.
- What are you doing?
It's all right. It's just the Tarzan in me.
That Schweinehund.
Peanuts!
Get your fresh roasted peanuts, folks!
They're nice and hot!
Get your peanuts!
Here you are!
There you are, you...
What are you laughing at?
- Those clothes don't fit you.
You're getting to be a good shot, Tomasso.
The opera starts. Now we really go to work.
The curtain's up.
- They've started.
- Now, don't worry.
Someone open the door here!
Let me out of here!
Herr Gottlieb.
- Where are they?
Where did they go?
- What?
"What," he asks me.
- Did a couple of men come up here?
- What?
"What?" All I get is "what."
How would you like to feel the way she looks?
That is Driftwood's voice.
- I want him put out of the opera house.
That's right. You go talk to him.
We know he's in the audience someplace.
- Where's Mr. Gottlieb?
- The other side of the stage.
Come on, boys.
What was that?
High "C" or vitamin "D"?
What's the matter?
What happened here?
Mr. Gottlieb!
Here, give me a hand.
Where are those men?
Did you catch them?
No, sir. I'm sorry. They're still out there.
Still out there?
I have an idea. Get me two gypsy costumes at once.
Now we're getting somewhere.
I will not sing unless they are put off there.
Yes, sir.
A battleship in II Trovatore!
Stop!
Don't you do...
Herr Gottlieb!
Lassparri, he's disappeared.
What?
- Then we haven't even a tenor.
- Mr. Gottlieb.
- You are Baroni.
- That's who I am.
Get into a costume quickly.
- What?
- I want you to sing.
But I have no reputation, Mr. Gottlieb.
Besides, I couldn't sing with a strange Leonora.
I've been rehearsing with Miss Castaldi.
- So that's it.
- That's it exactly.
All right. Get them two costumes at once. Quick.
Please, after the opera. Go ahead. Get ready.
You hear that?
That's real singing.
- What?
- Get off!
Is this the opera house?
Arrest those men, and this one, too.
- It's about time.
- Lassparri, where have you been?
Been?
Do you know what they did to me?
I'll sing them an encore that they'll never forget.
Never in my life have I received such treatment.
They threw an apple at me.
Watermelons are out of season.
Rosa, Baroni, get out there quick.
No. I'm under arrest, Mr. Gottlieb.
- What's that?
- If they're arrested, I ought to be, too.
I can't sing if I'm arrested.
What do we do?
We must have them.
They'll save the entire season.
Well, what is it you want?
Just a minute. Let me handle this.
- Quick!
What do you want?
- First, call off that police dog.
All right, anything.
These men are in this country under false pretenses, and I'll do my duty.
I'll be responsible for them.
Besides, they came over here with Mr. Driftwood.
Mr. Driftwood is an employee of the Opera Company.
- Since when?
- Since Baroni started singing.
Wait till I get a hold of that elevator operator.
All right, anything. Please, go out and sing.
Wait a minute.
Before he sings, you gotta sign a contract, and I get 10%.
Yes, and I get 10%, too.
Now, where were we?
- "The party of the 10th part..."
- "The party of the 11th part..."
- No.
No.
No! Positively no!
- I should say not!
Yes...
Now, get this seaver. The next one to come in late is to be fired.
Why, of course, j.G.
Now, these time records show That there's only one employee without any marks against him. Number 48.
How long has he been with us?
Eight years and never late?
Say, that's the sort of people we want around here.
Most decidedly, j.G.
Let's raise his salary.
Why, certainly, j.G. Most decidedly, of course.
Where's Jones?
He isn't in yet.
Why, it's after nine!
Guess he's late.
Why, that's impossible.
Jones is never late!
Have you seen Jones?
Not this morning.
Have you?
No, I haven't.
He must be late.
Yes, he must be late. Yes, he must be late.
My goodness me, Jones!
Of all people, Jones!
Yup.
Good morning, cymbaline.
Good morning, Edwarse.
I had a wonderful dream last night.
I'd like to tell you about it.
But you're much too young.
I wish that dream would come true some day.
But it won't, Edwarse, will it?
Take your time, Abelard. You'll get your breakfast.
Yeah, but I...
Excuse me, sir.
Jones!
Go ahead, Jones.
I'm waiting.
Well, Mr. seaver, I... I bought a new alarm clock last week.
It carried a five year guarantee.
And this morning, it went back on me.
You went back on me, Jones!
You placed me in a very difficult position!
This morning, j.G. Instructed me to raise your salary.
Oh, he did?
Oh, thank you, Mr. seaver.
Yes, but he also gave me instructions to fire the next employee who came in late.
And you're both people, Jones.
Now, what am I going to do?
I can't raise your salary and then fire you. That wouldn't make sense, would it?
No, sir. It wouldn't.
Oh, dear! Why do such things have to happen to me?
All right, Jones. I'll figure something out. Yes, sir.
You better get busy on that McIntyre account.
We're behind already.
Miss Clark!
You're late, miss Clark!
Late?
What for?
Did something happen?
I want to know why you see fit to step in at 9:30 this morning!
Well, if you must know, it's because I saw fit to step out at 9:30 last night.
It might interest you to know that j.G. Gave me orders to fire the first person who came in late...
That's me, I guess. It most certainly is!
Well, in that case, I quit.
We don't fire people in the middle of the week. You can stay until Saturday.
That's mighty big of you.
Hiya, Jonesy.
I'm not into anybody, Sam.
Now, that's my idea of a boyfriend. He-man plus.
If I only knew where he was.
Sam?
Sam, get a load of this.
Look! Who is this?
Killer Mannion.
I know, but who else?
What do you mean, who else?
Look!
Well, what do you know about that?
Here, Charlie. Come here!
Come here, Charlie.
Loo-look at this!
Do you get it?
Say, that's right!
Come on, boys and girls!
Stick 'em up!
Hello, killer! Who you figure on rubbing' out today, big boy?
I... I wish you would leave me alone.
I'm way behind on the macherine... Thank... McIntyre account.
Sorry, killer. We didn't mean any harm. You're aces with us, chief.
Say, there's a couple of guys we'd like snuffed out.
Here, here! What's going on there?
Get back to your desks, you people!
Jones!
Yes, sir.
I'll have the vegetable plate as usual.
Hello.
Oh, miss Clark...
Mind if I sit with you?
I'd be delighted.
Well, I've be canned. Feel like celebrating.
I'm fed up with that office anyway. Full of nuts.
One of them's been annoying me for weeks. Yes.
Sends me verses. To cymbaline.
There's so sloppy, the guy's afraid to sign them.
Ope... operator!
Police head... Police headquarters! Please!
Quick!
It's an emergency!
Yes!
There are crooks in that office. Crooks?
Yes.
I've got a picture of myself down at the office to have framed.
It cost me two bucks, and somebody swiped it!
Well... Imagine that.
Hey, bud! Rush it. It's Mannion.
Make it snappy! It's Mannion!
Okay!
Standby. Calling all cars.
Or else hop a freighter. I've always wanted to go abroad.
Yes. So have I. You know, that's why I started to write.
Jonesy, don't tell me you're a writer! Oh, yeah.
I've written a lot of stories.
Say, I finished one yesterday about Egypt. Egypt?
Yeah, I've always been interested in Egypt.
Shanghai, for instance. I've always wanted to go to Shanghai.
Say, I've got a stamp from Shanghai.
What is that? A fire?
I hope it's the j.G. Carpenter company burning down.
Stick 'em up, man!
Stick 'em up, man, and be quick about it!
You're making a big mistake.
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. This man's name is Al...
Shut up!
My name is not Mannion. It's Jones.
I'm a member of the YMCA, gentlemen. I have my card right here. I'll show you...
He's got a gun!
Cuff him! Get him out of here!
You got the wrong man!
My name isn't Mannion, I tell you all!
No, we know your name is... wait a minute. Where's that young lady? Where is... never mind.
She'll be taken care of.
I know, but...
They're grilling Mannion's girl now. I'll get her life story later. Yes!
They won't let us see him until the D.A. Gets here.
Don't worry, we'll get a story as soon as he gets here.
Who do I have... Who do I have to see about the reward?
What reward? You know, for the capture of Mannion.
I saw him first! And I telephoned the police.
You did?
Hey, bill, shoot this guy.
No! He put the finger on Mannion.
We got the man who put the finger on Mannion!
It was me that pulled the rod on him. Detective sergeant Michael F. Boyle.
And Howe.
Detective sergeant Patrick j. Howe.
Boyle... And Howe.
The D.A.'s coming! What?
Take those guys out, all of them!
You picked the wrong town, Mannion!
You got the wrong man, I tell you.
I may look like Mannion, but I'm not Mannion...
M-my name is Jones!
I work for the j.G. Carpenter corporation.
Sure.
In battle creek, you were a book agent.
In superior, Wisconsin, a preacher.
Now, you work for the j.G. Carpenter corporation.
But I've been working for them for eight years.
Gentlemen, I'm... I'm a member of the YMCA.
Get your cameras running! Here comes the district attorney!
Well, Mannion! My name is...
Good work, Mac.
Thanks, chief.
Checked out the YMCA. Find the Jones, 33?
Yeah, 33.
Well, Mannion, we've got...
My name is not Mannion.
It's Jones.
Only way to keep out of jail is to come clean with us!
Now, who pulled that Bloomingdale bank job?
Was it your boyfriend?
Who was in on it with him?
They just picked up slugs Martin. Okay.
But that dame won't talk!
Take it easy, would you? The D.A. Just got here. They're sweatin' them now.
She has beautiful blue eyes, but they have a cold, sinister look that mark her at once as a gangster's moll.
It's no use playin' gaga, Mannion.
We've picked up slugs Martin.
Slugs Martin? Who's he?
If you think you're going to gain anything by...
J.G. Carpenter's outside.
Show him in. Who is he?
Oh, that's my boss!
He'll identify me!
What's the idea dragging me down here without a word of explanation?
I'm a very busy man.
I'll only take a minute of your time, Mr. carpenter. I just want you to identify somebody.
Take a good look at this man.
Do you know him?
I never saw him in my life.
But Mr. carpenter,
I've been working for you for eight years!
He says he works for you. Well, maybe he does.
We have a large office, employ over a hundred clerks, and I'm...
Wait a minute. He does look a bit familiar at that.
Certainly, he would, if you read the papers this morning.
The papers?
What's...
Why...
Why, it's Mannion.
That's right.
Killer Mannion!
But Mr. carpenter...
Just a minute!
What do you want to stick to a guy like that for? He's got a dame in every town!
Look how he ran out on that gal in des moines. He'll run out on you too!
Guys like that always do!
Where do we change cars?
If you want to keep your nose clean, all you gotta do is open up.
Turn in state's evidence, and I personally guarantee you can beat the rap.
I'll take cheese.
Hey, Boyle, come here.
Well, baby, you'll be interested to know mannion's just confessed.
Right in there, this minute.
Well, what do you think of that?
Well, I guess the jig's up. Sure it is!
But not for you, kid. Not if you want to play ball.
Imagine that heel squealing.
Yeah, and he says you drove the death car.
He did?
Lieutenant, I'll talk now! I'll tell everything!
What do you want to know?
Well, about that Bloomingdale bank stick-up, it was Mannion, wasn't it?
Yup. Mannion.
Why are you wasting Mr. Spencer's time for? Snap out of it! Quit kidding'!
Yes, but you're making a mistake. If you'd only call Mr. seaver...
Where does he live?
At the YMCA too? No!
Don't make me do it! You don't know mannion!
He broke jail just to get me! If I identify him...
It's too late now, slugs! He knows you ratted on him!
You got nothin' to lose!
Look, I can identify him through the door, can't I? I don't want him to see me! What's a matter, slugs?
What you scared of?
He can't touch you! We frisked him! You don't know mannion!
He pulls guns out of his ears!
Don't make me do it! Well, we washed his ears! Now, come on!
No, don't! Don't!
Gangway...
I tell you, D.A., I don't know that much. I hardly ever seen this guy.
Come on! Come on!
Well, go on!
My name is Jones!
I guess mine is Mickey mouse.
So you broke out to get me?
When I'm sorry to disappoint you, mannion, but you ain't got a chance!
Now, you're sunk. You'll burn for this, and I know a lot of guys that ain't gonna cry!
Me in particular!
Why, you dirty, double-crossin' yellow...
How about that first national bank in Harrisburg?
That was mannion.
And that Evanston job? Mannion.
And that express company job in Peoria?
Mannion.
What do you think we are?
Hello, warden. Hello, Mr. Spencer.
Hello, Mac. Hello, warden.
There you are.
Thought you'd get away?
I treat you like a human being, and he runs out on me.
I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what anybody's talking about.
Well, you will before the night's over.
You're going to come clean with me or there won't be enough left of you to put in solitary.
Come on now, mannion! Who did it? Who helped you make that break?
My name isn't mannion! It's Jones!
The farmer's trust job in Denver?
Mannion.
The mail car robbery in Colorado Springs?
Mannion.
Come on, tell him who did it!
Who helped you make that I am? Lam?
What is the "Lam?"
Now, listen...
Wait a minute, warden.
What we want is positive identification.
Are you sure he's mannion?
If that's not mannion, you're not the district attorney.
That's it. That's enough. Take him away, boys.
- Right. - Oh, my goodness.
I beg your pardon, sir. Would you please tell me who I should see about the reward? What?
Please! Uptown?
D.A.'s gotta see it, Mac. Just got a flash from the office.
What about? Mannion just robbed a bank uptown. You've been drinking.
I know, but it happened just a few minutes ago.
You're crazy!
I know that too! But he just stuck up a bank!
It must have been somebody else!
Well, I told the officer it couldn't happen, but it did!
The cashier and several people identified him as mannion, positively! And the guy told them he was mannion!
But we got mannion here! Yeah!
I can't help it. He just robbed a bank!
Get him! Get mannion!
Send him here! But if mannion just robbed...
The fella we had in this room! Whoever it is, bring him back!
The guaranteed trust company in Fresno?
Mannion.
That Sacramento steel company payroll stick-up?
Mannion.
Pardon me. I wonder if you could tell me where to get the reward.
I don't know. Where could I find Mr. Spencer?
Mr. Spencer?
I don't know.
I don't care what anybody says.
He looks more like mannion than mannion does!
Well, my name isn't Jones. It's mannion. I mean, it isn't Jannion.
It's Jones! Jones!
That's what it is! Gentlemen, please!
Over here, please.
Oh, Mr. seaver, please, what's my name?
What are you doing here?
I don't know, Mr. seaver. I don't know.
Just a minute, boys. Let me through here, please.
We've just tracked down this man's fingerprints, D.A.
Well?
There's something wrong.
They're not mannion's.
I told you my name was Jones.
I bet it is at that.
It ain't mannion at all. It was a guy named Jones.
Well, thank you, sir.
Forget it.
Say, you haven't got a twin brother, have you? Oh, no, sir.
I have no relations of any sort.
Except my aunt Agatha in Bridgeport, Connecticut.
Jones, that McIntyre account you're working on...
Oh, yes, the McIntyre!
Oh, Mr. Spencer, I should be getting back to the office, really.
Did you mind? That's all right.
You're free to go. Get out.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Well, come, Jones.
Yes, Mr. seaver.
Gentlemen, I'm sorry I caused you all this trouble.
That's all right.
But wait!
He can't leave here.
Why not?
He looks too much like mannion.
He'd be back here in 15 minutes. Every cop in the city is looking for him.
That's right.
But what are we gonna do?
Get me the mannion files, fingerprints, photographs, everything they got, bring 'em in.
I heard they got the wrong man in there. It ain't mannion!
That's right. Somebody made a mistake.
Somebody?
It was me who made a mistake!
My life wasn't worth a dollar before. It ain't worth a ruble now. Mannion's sure to get me!
Well, what do you want me to do? Order some crape?
You dragged me in here to identify him! You gotta protect me! You gotta take care of me!
Lock me up!
D.A., he ought to leave the state.
That's no good. The police are after mannion all over the country.
Then he's got to leave the country.
But gentlemen, my work at the office would...
He has the McIntyre accounts to get up!
D.A., slugs Martin just came in. He's afraid that mannion will get him now. Wants us to put him in jail.
That's it! That's what we'll do with him, with this guy!
We'll stick him in the can.
On what charge?
Drunk and disorderly, vagrancy, and anything as long as he's locked up.
That's not a bad idea.
Send him up to my place. I have a few spare cells.
Gentlemen, I... I hardly think that I could...
What are we going to do about the McIntyre account?
I could fix one of them up, nice and home-like, with flowers and everything, and he can stay there until we get mannion!
Gentlemen, I don't think that that would...
I've got it!
Yeah. I'll give him a letter saying he is not mannion.
Then if he gets in trouble, he can flash it.
Sort of a passport? Yeah, that's the idea.
A passport.
I'll dictate it right now.
Harry, get busy. Official stationery.
"To whom it may concern...
"This is to testify "that the holder of this letter,
Mr..."
- Joe... Jones. - Jones.
Yes, Arthur Ferguson Jones.
Yeah, "Mr. Arthur Ferguson Jones..." Yes, that's right.
"Is not to be molested by the police
"because of his resemblance to one killer mannion."
Come on, sister.
D.A., you got nothin' to worry about. We got everything sort...
Mr. Jones, we owe you an apology.
But anybody could have made the same mistake.
This letter will keep you from being annoyed by the police.
But you must keep it with you at all times.
Yes, sir, I will. Thank you very much, sir.
Oh, miss Clark, are you all right?
Never felt better in my life.
Well, I've just come back from a cross country sleigh ride.
What is it, Boyle?
What's wrong with you?
I'm okay, d.A. I just swallowed something.
Newspaper men are getting impatient, d.A. All right.
Come along, Jones. We're holding up headline.
Mr. Jones, the man who looks like mannion, will now say a few words.
My... my name is Jones.
It's Arthur Ferguson Jones.
I was sitting in the restaurant, having lunch when... I...
I... He's fainted!
Give him some air!
Let's see the passport!
It was terribly embarrassing.
Wasn't it, miss Clark? Not to me.
Well, there was...
There was a person there by the name of slugs Martin to identify him... Slugs Martin?
He wanted to poke my eyes out as I sat there, handcuffed.
And if weren't for the police, he'd have done it too.
Come, come, folks! The newspapers contain a full account, I believe!
This won't help you to get out the McIntyre account, Jones. How about a little work? Just for contrast?
J.G. Wants to see you, jonesy.
Who?
J.G., the boss, in his office.
He's private office?
Yeah, his private office.
Oh, j.G. just sent for me.
Well, what are you worrying about?
But in his private office. I've never been in his private office.
Stop being scared!
I'm responsible for all this fuss.
You know, he might fire me.
Just growl at him, killer. You'll scare him to death.
J.G... Mr. carpenter wants to see me in his...
Private office.
I'm sorry, Jones.
Come in, Jones.
Jones, I want you to meet Mr. Healy, a friend of mine from "the record."
Put her there, killer.
J.G.'s just been tellin' me about that marvelous publicity.
Mr. carpenter, believe me,
I had no intention of getting the firm's name into this. I merely told the reporter...
That's quite all right, Jones. Sit... sit down.
Come on, sit down! Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.
Have a cigar.
I'm sorry, but I never...
Have one. Good for ya.
Smoke it. Thank you, sir.
That's the best cigar you can get.
Say, Jones,
I want to apologize for not identifying you this afternoon.
Mr. carpenter, my goodness, that was quite all right.
No, that was a pretty tough ordeal you went through.
I understand you fainted.
Well, all those questions made me quite dizzy, sir.
Well, that's understandable. I'd have been a wreck myself.
Hey, look here, I understand you write.
Yes, sir. I do.
On my own time, sir.
Healy here has got an idea he wants to talk to you about.
It's like this, jonesy, the paper figures this is a good time to pull the life story of mannion.
Who is the best man In the world to write that story, outside of mannion himself?
The man who looks like mannion!
Good idea, I thought. Bring in the name of the firm...
An inspiration!
Swell!
Do you... you... Do you mean you... You want me to write for the papers?
Make a great story!
Yes, but...
I don't know anything about mannion.
You don't have to write the stuff you sell.
All we want is permission to use your name.
"Arthur Ferguson Jones, the man who looks like mannion."
Swell!
Look!
We'll run your picture in the paper everyday, together with mannion's. That we'll run another 30 days. Maybe longer!
Your moniker! Your mug!
The name of the firm!
On the front page of every paper every day!
Think of that, jonesy!
Think of it!
Yes, sir. I will. I'll think of it.
Don't think too long, my boy.
We've got to get started right away!
The first installment starts tomorrow. The day after, at the latest.
Now, look...
A fine host you are, j.G. Where do you keep it?
I remember. In there.
Well, how do you like it?
It smells nice.
I'm sorry, sir, but I don't drink... Come on!
Snap out of it! We've all got our hair down.
Come on, a toast!
To the man that looks like mannion!
To the man who looks like mannion!
Poor jonesy. I hope he don't lose his job.
I hope he does!
Best thing in the world for him.
Listen to this,
"Mr. Jones writes at night, "hoping to storm the citadel of literary fame.
He's written for years without any encouragement."
Can you imagine jonesy, an author?
Yes, I can!
I've always thought that rabbit had something.
All he needs is courage.
Say, tell me somethin', palsy. What do you think of this guy, mannion?
I'll tell you something, palsy.
Mannion is a false alarm.
Highly overrated.
And that goes for all those criminals.
A criminal is as brave as his gun.
You take his gun away and he's a coward, just like anybody else.
That's it!
That's our first lead! What?
"'Mannion, false alarm, says Jones."
Put it there, palsy!
It's gonna be a sensation!
There, let's have another drink!
Let's have a couple more, I reckon.
This is an extra special occasion.
And so long, Healy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
Jones!
Hello, seaver.
Hey, you know something?
A woman is only a woman, but a good cigar...
Is a smoke.
Hi, cymbaline!
Hey, you know what?
You know, we've all misjudged j.G.
He's a great man, cymbaline.
Heart of gold.
Proud to work for old j.G. I'd die for j.G!
I'd die for j.G.'s company!
I'd die for you.
Whoopee!
Seaver...
I've taken the afternoon off.
J.G.'s suggestion.
But Jones, I don't...
Oh, yes, seaver, I forgot.
You put miss Clark back on the payroll.
J.G.'s order. What?
You check with him.
So long, slaves!
I always told you that rabbit had something.
Hello, Edwarse!
Sing and the world sings with you!
Yes, but only sing with respect,
Because I'm gonna write the life of mannion.
Yes, sir.
I'm gonna show him up for what he is.
The big fall flusher.
Just a moron with a gun in his hand.
I'd like to meet that fellow.
I'd go right up to him, and I'd say,
"why, you great, big, yellow, bl..."
All right, tough guy.
Hand over.
Come on, that letter the d.A. Gave you.
Come on!
That's perfect.
Now, listen, buddy,
I gotta go 50/50 on this pass.
You're gonna use it in the daytime and me at night.
It'll come in mighty handy.
That's why I dropped in to see you.
Can you talk? Yes, sir.
Well, don't.
You know what's good for you, you won't open your trap without my being here,
To nobody, understand?
Don't get careless after I leave here.
Because if anything happens to me, one of my mob will take care of you.
You get that?
Yes, sir.
Okay.
Now, just sit there.
And don't let nobody come into this room.
I got a little work to do and...
I'll be back in the morning.
Come on.
Don't worry, Edwarse.
Maybe he won't come back after all.
Maybe it was all a dream.
Why aren't you in bed?
I couldn't sleep last night.
Here's your passport.
Two cops stopped me last night.
Worked like a charm.
Thank you.
I guess it'll do.
All I wanna do is lay up here for a couple of days.
Just long enough to take care of a rat by the name of slugs Martin.
Slugs Martin?
You know, he wanted to gouge my eyes out yesterday.
He did?
Well, he ain't gonna do any more gouging when I get through with him.
What's that?
It's the morning paper.
Pick it up.
Anything about me in it?
Go on now, read it to me.
It says here you killed two guards last night.
They lie. It was three.
Go on, read it to me.
"At midnight yesterday,"
"public enemy number one," "killer mannion cold-bloodedly"
"slewed two guards in the raid" "on the state armory."
"Accompanied by two of his men, "mannion surprised the guards at the armory..."
what's the matter?
That's all there is.
What?
What are you talking about? Why, the whole front page is full of me!
You're gonna write about me?
Well, I can... I can get in touch with the newspaper office and call the whole thing off, Mr. mannion.
What for?
It's okay with me.
Only be careful what you pull, that's all.
You oughta beat it now, will ya? I'm getting sleepy.
Yes, sir.
What time do you knock off?
At five o'clock, sir.
Well, be here at six prompt.
Bring the afternoon papers.
Yes, sir.
The afternoon papers?
You heard me. And don't you forget it.
Yeah, and remember one word outta you, and you're out like a light.
Yes, sir.
Now, shove off.
- Good morning, Mr. Jones.
Hi, jonesy. How are you?
This is Mr. Jones speaking.
Mr. Arthur Ferguson Jones.
Yes.
Well, I want to talk to Mr. Healy.
Yes, I must immediately.
My goodness, he's not?
Well, will you have him call me the moment he comes in?
Yes, it's very important!
Hiya, front page! You busy?
Yes, sort of.
What do you got there? Fan mail?
Yes, a most extraordinary amount of letters.
Well, how do you like that? First sign of success. Can you use a good secretary?
Oh, excuse me. This is a call I'm expecting.
Photographs?
I'm sorry, but I have no photographs!
Of all the ridiculous things... Can you imagine...
That's your public, jonesy. You're becoming famous.
Three of my girlfriends asked me to get pictures of you.
I told them the kind of a caveman you were.
I can feel that kiss yet.
Why, I... I want to apologize for that, miss Clark...
What for?
If it takes a few swigs to bring out that personality of yours, I'll buy a case of scotch.
It wasn't the drinks.
Something came over me and...
I just couldn't help it.
I'm glad you couldn't.
It isn't every girl gets kissed by the man that looks like mannion.
At least, I hope it isn't.
Well, I should say not!
Thanks, jonesy.
Well, well, well, good morning, Jones.
I see your boyfriend was quite busy last night up at the armory.
Say, I hope you didn't have anything to do with that.
No, sir. Hardly.
You know, you were the topic of conversation all through dinner last night.
Mrs. carpenter wants to meet you.
I promised her I'd have you up for dinner sometime soon.
Well, I... I'd love that, sir.
That's fine. I'll let you know when. And let's see...
You know, that younger son of mine wanted me to ask you for your autograph.
Sign your name there.
Do you want me to...
Say, that's fine, Jones. Thanks.
Have a smoke.
Thank you.
So long, Jones.
Jonesy, you sure are going places!
Just think of it, an invitation to the boss' shack!
Say, when those articles come out, they'll be no stopping you.
How much are they paying you for them? I don't know.
Healy never said anything about...
Jonesy, you need a caretaker.
And I think I'm elected.
If you're afraid to talk to Healy, I'm not.
Say, you can get enough out of this to take that trip to Shanghai.
More mail, jonesy. And a telegram.
Oh, my goodness.
My aunt Agatha from Bridgeport is coming for a visit.
Well, what of it?
Yes, but I'm... I'm not in the position to have any visitors just now.
Why aren't you?
I haven't seen her for five years. Now, why should she want to come here now?
I've got trouble enough without her!
What's a matter with you? You haven't got a trouble in the world!
But I have!
The McIntyre account.
I'd like to get it cleared up before the end of the year.
I wish you'd struggle through with it without the assistance of... Miss Clark.
I get it. I can take a hint. Yes.
Has Mr. Healy come to the office yet?
But I've simply got to talk to him!
It's terribly important!
Well, c-could you give me his home phone?
I know, I know, but... But please... Please let me have it!
Yes, but I've been trying to get Mr. Healy since 9:30 this morning!
Well, I must get in touch with him! It's a matter of life and death!
Well, never mind. Never mind. I'll come down to the office myself.
It's the paper! Read all about mannion! By the man that looks like mannion!
Jonesy!
Jonesy, I had to see ya!
I waited at the office for you to come back. Where were you?
Well, I didn't feel well.
I've been walking around all afternoon.
And I went down to the docks.
There was a freighter there leaving for Shanghai.
How I wanted to get on that boat!
After that story?
Say, you'd be a fool to leave here now.
I read it, and it's marvelous!
By the way, Healy was in to see you. I made a deal for you.
He screamed murder at first, but finally, we got together.
Listen to this, 250 bucks a week!
I guess that trip to Shanghai is a cinch now, jonesy.
Here's the contract. I told him I'd get you to sign it tonight. Thank you.
Don't mention it.
Always glad to serve a public enemy.
What do you say we go up to your room and read it over?
All right. Oh, no! No!
No, not upstairs.
What now?
Well, the...
Th-the landlady is very strict about it.
Puh-lease, Mr. Jones! You can leave the door open. Oh, no, no.
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.
Here, I'll... I'll sign this tomorrow.
Say, I... I want to thank you for everything you've done for me.
I want you to know how much I appreciate it.
No matter what happens to me.
Who is it?
It's Jones.
May I come in?
Come in.
What the devil kept ya?
I told you to be back here by six, didn't I?
I'm sorry, sir, but I couldn't get here any sooner.
When I say "six," I mean "six."
Next time you hold me up, there'll only be one of us that looks like mannion.
Th-there wasn't anyone here to see me?
No lady?
No.
Is that the afternoon papers?
Yes, sir. Well, let's have it.
Go on, now, fix me some coffee.
Hey, jonesy!
Come here!
"False alarm."
You shot off a lot of steam, didn't ya?
I'm a false alarm, am I?
I didn't write it, sir.
Man on the paper did it.
I... I tried to stop him from printing it.
Yeah, I guess a lot of guys think I'm a false alarm!
Oh, no!
Who's gonna write the rest of these articles?
I'm supposed to, but I'll call the whole thing off.
Not now, you won't!
You're gonna write them, all right, only, you're gonna write them my way!
Sit down!
Yes, sir.
I'll show you.
A false alarm, am I?
Well, I'll slip you some dope that'll make their heads dizzy.
Stuff that nobody knows.
Are you ready?
Yes, sir.
Okay.
Now, just put down what I give ya. Don't make up nothin' from your own hair.
You said here, I'm as brave as the gun in my hand.
Now, right, you listen to this.
When I broke out of state the other day, I had a gun, yeah, but it was a phony.
That's the kind of a false alarm I am. Have you got that down?
Yeah, I put the turn key on 'em with my hands!
Then when I leave to turn the corridor, it was jammed by bricks from the law.
It was what?
Every guard was soft-shoein' around.
Don't ask no questions. Just put down what I give ya. Yes, sir.
And then I pulled a phony gun on 'em, told them to stick up their mitts, and I grabbed their rods, and I made 'em step out ahead of me, to the yard, like they was takin' me to the warden's office.
We passed a dozen other guards on the way out.
I figured the whole thing out myself.
There was only one guard I had in the bag, and that was the one to the gate, but nobody knows...
What are you makin' them things for? Why don't you put down what I give ya?
Well, Th-this is shorthand writing.
Yeah, then when I gets out into the yard, one of the guys in front of me, squawks and hot-foots it for the gate.
Well, I let him have it with one of the heaters.
Heaters?
Shut up!
Then I grabs the other guy and I holds him in front of me, just as I'm startin' for the gate.
By this time, the typewriters up on the walls are cutting lose, cranking away, and the air is as thick as dust with machine gun bullets.
Look at that article.
This man Jones seems to know a whole lot about mannion.
If he's just a clerk, how'd he get the information about the prison break?
Well, he says here one of the guards was fixed. Yeah. How do you suppose he found that out?
That's what I'd like to know.
I thought you and I were the only ones who knew about that.
You haven't been talking, have you?
Chief, you don't think that I...
No, of course. Of course.
But if you ask me, there's something queer about the whole business.
Jones... he's at luncheon with Mr. carpenter.
Why?
I don't know. Excuse me.
Well, Mr. Chindler, what do you expect to get for nothing today?
Out of you, miss Sherlock, nothing. Where's Arthur Ferguson Jones?
He won't be back this afternoon. Half-day, Saturdays. Is it anything important?
His first paycheck, that's all.
I'll take it. You expect to see him?
Yeah. When?
This afternoon.
Okay. Tell him I want to see him as soon as possible. There's something I want to ask him.
What do you want to know?
Who's been helping him write those stories?
What do you mean, who's been helping him?
Where does a squirt like Jones get off writing all that juicy underworld lingo?
From me, of course.
You certainly have horned in yourself properly, haven't you? What do you get out of them?
Nothing.
Well... You can always do business with me.
I'm only interested in Jones.
One of my men ran into Jones this morning. Nearly plugged him before he could show him that paper.
You know, same thing happened to us last night.
Ran plumb into him. I'm telling you, he nearly got a bullet right through that passport.
Thought sure we had mannion.
That guy Jones is gettin' in our hair.
I wish he's stay put.
Well, it would make things simpler for us.
You know, Washington wants us to shoot on sight.
Now, how can we with this fella Jones running around?
That's right. That's what's holdin' us up.
Well, then put him away!
That's it! Get Jones!
Boyle! Yes, sir. Get Jones!
Yes, sir. Get Jones.
Get Jones.
Who is it?
It's me!
For heaven's sake, jonesy, if thought you were gonna keep me waiting out there all night,
I'd have brought a cot. Well, mystery of mysteries. I finally made it.
I actually am seeing how the other half lives.
And it's just what I expected, jonesy.
Cozy, warm, old-worldly, even a canary bird.
Expresses your personality completely.
Well, I'm glad you like it.
It's adorable.
And now, Mr. Jones, prepare yourself for the thrill of a lifetime.
Your first paycheck! As an author, I mean.
The magic carpet which will carry you to Shanghai and eternal ecstasy.
Why, you thief you!
So it was you who stole my picture.
Oh, jonesy, you're cute.
Why, jonesy!
Well, I...
Well... I... I think I better be going...
Oh, no... I just came up to bring you the check...
Oh, no. Wait a minute. Stick around...
Oh, no, no. The landlady is awfully strict about this sort of thing.
I'll be seeing you at the office!
Nick!
Harry!
Give me the police department. Hurry!
Hello, police department? This is miss Clark speaking.
Listen, I know where man...
The police are exceptionally trigger-conscious these days, Mr. Jones.
But you can't very well blame them for that.
That's why we want to place you under protective arrest.
Well, yes, but I... I can't afford to lose my job at the office, Mr. Spencer.
It's either your job or your life.
Well, then, there are those articles that I'm writing for the newspapers...
You can write them up there.
But I can't.
Why not?
Well, there's...
There's my research.
Research?
Well, what better place for research for the sort of stuff you're writing than prison?
Right, Mr. mayor?
Right! That's true.
This isn't a question of choice, Mr. Jones.
This is a grave emergency.
That's true.
That's right, your honor.
I'd like to go home first, if you don't mind.
What for?
I'd like to pack a bag, sir.
Certainly. Certainly. Boyle and Howe will take you home.
Well, if you don't mind, I'd much rather...
Now, there's nothing to worry about, Mr. Jones. It's only for a short while.
Mannion is practically in our hands. We've got a pretty good idea where he is.
You have?
Yes, we have!
You mean that you...
All right, boys! Take Mr. Jones home.
Yes, sir. Well, thank you very kindly, gentlemen.
Well, thank heavens that's over.
I think I'll go up with ya.
No, no, no, no, no, please.
Why not? What's a matter?
Now, I'd rather you didn't.
I get it.
A dame?
Yes.
Okay, kid, but make it snappy.
You know, I got a hunch.
I got a hunch that 25 grand is gonna be caught by none other than detective sergeant Boyle.
And Howe.
Here's your gun, Mr. mannion.
You shouldn't leave it around like this.
What'd you pick up this gun for?
Why didn't you plug me when you had the chance?
You were asleep. You can't shoot somebody who's sleeping.
Why not?
I'd have done it if I'd have been in your place.
I'll tell you why you didn't do it.
You're afraid of me.
You're afraid of me, asleep or awake!
Yes, sir. Yeah.
What's that?
Who is it?
The police. They don't know you're here. They're waiting for me.
For you?
What for?
They want to send me to prison so I'll be out of the way.
I see.
Well, they told me I had no choice in the matter.
I had to go whether I wanted to or not.
Get over and wave to 'em.
Hurry up!
Tell 'em you'll be right down.
I'll be right down.
Hurry up and pack your grip. I don't want them dicks coming up here.
Yes, sir.
What's the interest on 25 grand at six percent?
No, you can't get six percent anymore.
You're lucky to get five percent.
Five percent...
12.50 a year... That's not bad.
Hey, what's he doin' up there?
Packin' a trunk? Say, you don't suppose he's tryin' any funny business, do ya?
Nuh, what's the percentage?
You know, maybe I should have gone up with him at that, dame or no dame.
I think I'll go up there and take a look.
Now, what kept you up there? I was just comin' up after ya.
Well, sorry.
Okay. Hop in.
Well, jonesy, when we get you safe up there in prison, it'll be a cinch to get mannion!
Yeah, sure.
Say... I'd like to stop on the way and phone, if you don't mind.
Okay, we'll stop someplace.
Thanks.
I'm on my way to the prison now. A couple of dicks are taking me up there.
What?
Well, slugs Martin is up there, ain't he?
That's what I've been waiting for, isn't it?
Okay. Now, you guys get a hold of Jones and hold him. We'll take care of him later.
Well, snap into it!
The boss just give us the ring and told us to come up here.
Time to get into your clothes, buddy.
Well Mr. mannion took my clothes...
Haven't you got another suit? Yes, I... I have a gray, two-button...
Well, get into that!
Yes, I will.
Could I offer you a cup of tea?
Go on, get dressed, will ya? Step it up!
Washington sent me down here to clean this thing up, and I'm going to do it.
I tell you, the key to the whole situation is Jones.
Did you read that article?
Why, yes. It's about mannion's prison break.
Jones says that mannion had one of the guards fixed.
That's right. Did you know that?
No. Did you?
No!
No one knew it except me and a couple of the men in my department.
And we kept it a secret!
Now, how did Jones know it, is what I want to know.
It might have been a stab in the dark.
Is that so?
Read the article. It's written as if Jones had been an eye-witness to the break! Worse than that, as if he took part in it.
Now, look here, Mr. Russell, surely, you don't think...
I don't think anything! There's something funny going on here. And I want to talk to Jones.
Get him down here right away.
Certainly.
There you are.
We're having trouble with slugs Martin. He don't want to wear the prison outfit.
Why should he? He's not a prisoner here. Here's here on his own volition.
Well, he looks kinda funny runnin' around the yard in his own clothes.
He'd look funny anywhere.
Hello?
Yes, yes, Mr. Spencer.
I'll send Jones to town right away.
Okay. Where's Jones?
In the visiting' room, talkin' to a friend of his.
A goofy-lookin' guy by the name of seaver.
Get Jones up here right away.
Okay, chief.
And I brought you something myself.
What's that?
The McIntyre account! Oh, yeah, yeah. I know.
Sure. As long as you're on the payroll, you might as well do a little work.
Goodness knows, you haven't been doing much work at the office lately, have you?
No, I haven't.
Well, you see, they've been keeping... Warden wants to see you right away, Mr. Jones.
Fine. Well, I'll be back and collect all these things.
That's mighty swell of the gang.
You give 'em... I'll be...
Jones has changed.
Mr. Jones...
There's something hot downtown. I just got a call from the district attorney.
He wants to see you right away.
Yes, sir. You're to take the next train. That's 2:30.
I've arranged for one of the guards To take you down to the station in an automobile.
Yes, sir. Be at the prison gate at two o'clock sharp.
Yes.
Is that all?
Wait a minute.
I don't know.
You look more like mannion than ever.
Get out.
Hello, Mr. Martin.
Well, now, don't make that mistake again.
I'm Jones. Arthur Ferguson Jones. You remember me?
Hello.
Hello. Hey, I've been trying to see you ever since I came here.
What about?
You know, I've been writing articles about him for one of them papers.
Oh, yeah?
And I understand you're a very good friend of his.
Who said I was? I never had any use for that coked-up rat!
Say, listen, that guy has double-crossed his own mother! As bad as all that?
Boy!
Come on, let's take a little stroll where we can be by ourselves?
You know, mannion don't mean a thing without the mob around him.
Get him by himself and he's as yellow as they make 'em.
Is that so? Yeah, he was off on me because I had his number. He knew he was slated for the skids.
Yeah.
And he was a dirty, double-crossin' rat. He should have been rubbed out long ago.
He was nothin' but a skunk. He crossed everybody that ever strung with him.
I'd like to meet him face to face. I'd skid him. I'd just like to watch the yellow come right up.
Why, the louse...
Better hurry up, Mr. Jones.
So long.
So long. So long.
I'll be seeing ya.
Oh, Jones!
The warden just told me that you were going into town.
And he said it would be all right if the guard gave me a lift to the station.
Well, that's swell.
What more do you want? You had the guy in your car, didn't ya?
But we didn't know it was him, chief. How could we? He even had Jones' clothes on!
That's right!
Alibi! You had a chance of a lifetime, and mannion made a sucker out of you!
And Howe!
Yeah, and you said if you ever got mannion back to prison again, he'd rot before he ever got out!
Well, you had him!
And you let him walk out!
I still don't think it was mannion. No?
Well, then who killed slugs Martin and the guard?
Maybe it was mannion.
But you can't pass the buck to me, Spencer. You sent him up as Jones!
Telephone, Mr. Spencer.
Yeah. Good afternoon. Good afternoon.
I'm the man who identified mannion in the first place, when he was Jones.
I've been working on the case ever since.
And I have a theory... Who is it? The same guy who's been calling me up all week!
I can't get him out of my hair!
Mr. carpenter.
Mr. Spencer, where's seaver?
Who the devil's seaver?
My office manager!
He went to the prison to see Jones. And he hasn't been heard of since!
Well, don't ask me! Ask the warden!
D.A., I called to see that Clark girl this morning, see? She wasn't home last night.
Well, what of it?
She's missing too!
Miss Clark!
Seaver!
Where's Jones?
I tell you, boss, this town's gettin' too hot for us. Let's get goin' while the goin's good.
There ain't a chance. They got every road covered.
What are you gonna do? Hang around here until they come and get us?
Leave it to me, will ya?
I haven't steered you wrong yet, have I?
I know, but...
Now, just a minute. There's only one chance of our getting' out of here.
That's if they stop lookin' for mannion.
Yeah? But who says they're gonna stop?
Say, if you was a copper and you found mannion dead, you'd stop lookin' for him, wouldn't you?
Hey!
Yeah.
Who's gonna croak you?
Hey, you ain't thinkin' of bumpin' yourself off.
Who, me?
Bring that guy Jones in here.
Come on, jonesy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just easy.
Just easy, please.
You mugs better beat it out of here. I'm goin' into a knack that's liable to break your hearts.
I'm very much obliged to you, gentlemen.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come in.
Sit down, jonesy.
Jonesy...
I got good news for you.
I'm sorry about dragging' you down here, but I had to get into that prison just because slugs Martin was there.
He ain't there anymore. He ain't anywheres.
I'm gonna try and I am out of town tonight.
They'll probably get me.
But not alive.
Maybe the next story you'll write about me will be all about how I was croaked.
I hope not, sir.
You can help me, jonesy.
How? It's gonna be the last favor I'm ever gonna ask of you.
I want you to take this money down to the first national bank and put it in the safety deposit vault.
And then when I'm croaked,
I want you to take the money out and deliver it to my mother.
You'll find her name and address in this envelope.
I'd do this myself only...
One of the guards up at the prison
Nicked me in the head when I beat it out of there.
You know, this wound would be a dead give-away.
Will you do it for me, jonesy?
Well... Couldn't you get one of your own men to do this for you?
One of my men?
Which one?
Why, there ain't a one of them in there that I can trust!
My mother would never get this dough!
And that's the one thing I'm trying to take care of before it's too late.
Yes, but... But how could I do it?
I'd be recognized as soon as I stepped out on the street.
I'd never reach the bank. That's smart of you.
But I figured that out too, myself.
You can put on a disguise.
Say, I done it lots of times when I pulled jobs.
Here. Here. Stick on this mustache.
Go on, now!
Where do you want me to put...
Put it on!
How's it feel?
Tickles a little.
You'll get used to it. There, there's a mirror over there. Go on.
My... my goodness.
It... it does make a difference, doesn't it?
Why, certainly! Say, you'd never be known in a million years.
You got a poke?
A poke?
Yeah, a pocketbook.
Oh, yes, sir.
Mr. mannion,
I don't like to refuse you anything, but...
You're not going to refuse me.
Why, think of the old lady.
She's alone and helpless. Have you got a mother?
No, sir.
Yes, but I... I've got an aunt Agatha in Bridgeport.
I'm terribly worried about her. She's disappeared someplace.
Well, aunts ain't the same as mothers.
What do you say, buddy?
Yes, sir.
Now, don't forget. First national bank. And be sure to get there before it closes.
Say, you better hurry up. There isn't much time left.
Come on, shove off!
Yes, sir.
Gee, boss, you were great. You almost fooled me.
Never mind.
Never mind. Look here...
Get to a phone right away. Call up the police.
Yeah, tell them you're one of slugs martin's men, sore about me knockin' him off, so you're tipping' them off that mannion is on his way to the first national bank to pull a stick-up single-handed. Me?
Tell them he's got a mustache on.
You know, the same disguise I had on for the Palmers trust bank in Denver.
I got it.
Well...
That's that. The minute Jones is bunked, the bars are down. And that's all we need.
What are you doin' now?
I'm goin' down to Gert's.
Now?
But, listen... Shut up, will ya? She's only down the street.
I know, boss, but with jonesy on the spot, we've gotta take a lamming out of town...
Are you the manager? Yes.
Killer mannion's gonna stick up this bank at closing time. Killer mannion?
Yeah, we're taking charge.
Now, we don't want anybody hurt.
Get all your clerks and the people downstairs out of sight. Hurry up.
Yes, sir.
Pay attention, everybody now! Get downstairs, quick as you can! Hurry!
Now, you men, take those coats off and leave them here!
Boys, get rid of those coats...
Now, get down there. Stay down there...
Go on downstairs! Yes, on your way.
On your way. Get down there. Come on, now!
Get that hat off there! What's the matter with you?
Take all those... Take that hat off!
You Mcgillicutty, what are you doin'? You think you're tryin... Get over there to that window.
Go on, get down here.
Keep those cannons straight on the door. Don't let anybody by. Nobody!
Take that hat off, you fat head!
First national bank! Quick!
Everything's all set, Mac.
But don't you think you better have a couple of men planted outside of that door? No.
If mannion spotted any of us outside, he's liable to start shooting.
Now, get back to your places!
Doorman! Yes.
You say you have a night bell outside?
Yes, sir.
Fine.
The minute you spot mannion, ring it! Yes, sir.
And don't be afraid. We're right behind you.
What's the hurry? Where's the fire? What's your name?
Why, my... My name is... O'Connor.
Mike O'Connor.
License 2698. Here.
Never mind. I'll walk.
Remember, when he comes through that door, shoot and shoot to kill. Have you got your men placed?
Down there, out of sight. Out of sight. Get your hats down there...
And the minute he comes through that door, let him have it, boys!
He ain't showed up yet. Fine.
Get back there. Stay at that door. Do you want to get killed?
No, sir.
Hey, you... Where do you think you're goin'? Get back here!
I'm sorry, officer.
I've got to get across the street. I've got to get to the first national bank.
Well, you wait for the signal.
Hey, mister, please! You can't go in there. The bank's done closed for the day.
Go on.
Watch it! Watch it!
Shoot to kill!
Hey, is the bank still open?
Yes, sir. Thank you.
That's funny.
I must have forgotten it.
I guess I left it on the table.
Well, I'll have to go back for it.
He done gone. He's gettin' away.
Come on, men!
That's the way we're gonna do it. We're gonna put it up to the boss straight.
If he don't want to go with us, we'll take it on the I am without him. That's right.
He can hang around here all he wants. But not me.
Me neither.
There he is now.
Remember, fellas. We stand pat. Okay.
What's the news, boss? Have the cops knocked off Jones yet? It's time you showed up, boss.
We was just thinkin' of leavin'. Yeah. We oughta get goin'.
This is the way we figure it.
It's a great idea having the cops knock off Jones, but now that it's over...
We wanna leave!
- This town is gettin' too hot for us. - I'll get the car!
The boys don't like the idea of hanging around here, just on account of Gert.
If you've gotta have a dame, we can take the Clark girl along.
That Clark dame's okay.
But the other two, they're a pain in the neck.
Seaver's all right.
But that aunt Agatha, she's a holy terror. She almost talked me to death!
Jones is comin' back!
Somethin' must've gone wrong!
What's that boob coming here for?
What do we do now, boss?
Should we let him in?
Yeah, let him in.
Should we plug him?
Yeah, plug him.
It's more humane this way. Sure.
All right? Yeah, all right.
All right, get him in there!
Go on! Give me a hand!
Get back in there!
It's jonesy!
He's fainted again. Get some water, quick! Get some water!
Oh, Arthur! Arthur! Jonesy!
Gentlemen, some water quickly!
Mr. Jones has fainted!
Come on, come on! Get going, get going!
Who... who do I have to see about the reward?
Just a minute!
Now, jonesy, will you give us a great, big kiss?
And look right into these cameras.
Now, quiet, boys.
Okay. How about it, jonesy?
Do you need a slug of whiskey?
I should say not.
Corny, who do you think you're talking to?
If the attorneys don't know who the heir is, who does?
Come on. I've done you a lot of favours.
Who's getting the Semple dough?
You're asking the wrong guy. I'm only a press agent.
- Newspaperman?
- Wants to know the heir.
- Hang up.
- Sorry, Mac, I can't...
- Yeah, but I ain't the attorney. - Hang up!
Mr Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.
- Cedar, we gotta deal with the papers.
- I'm not interested.
But it's a great story.
Somewhere a guy is walking into 20 million bucks.
My concern is to locate the lucky man.
When I do, keep the newspapers away.
OK, as long as that weekly stipend keeps coming in.
We located him, Mr Cedar.
- Yes, John, we got him.
- Here.
Longfellow Deeds, 28, Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
- Thank heaven. - Wire him.
No. I'm going there myself.
You too, Anderson. You too, Cobb.
Make three train reservations to Mandrake Falls.
- Where?
- Mandrake Falls.
"Welcome to Mandrake Falls... "where the scenery enthralls...
"where no hardship e'er befalls. "Welcome to Mandrake Falls." That's pretty.
- You're sure he lives here?
- This is the town, all right.
Well, I hope it's not a wild-goose chase.
No, sir, we checked it thoroughly.
He lives here, all right. I spy a native. Let's ask him.
- Good morning. - Morning, neighbours, morning.
That's an excellent start. At least we've broken the ice.
Do you know a fellow called Longfellow Deeds?
Deeds?
Yes, sir.
Yes, indeedy. - Everyone knows Deeds.
- Must be a game he's playing.
We'd like to get in touch with him.
- Who's that?
- Deeds. Who do you think?
Oh, yes, Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic.
You won't have no trouble at all. Talks to anybody.
We'd better try somebody else.
Next time he comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
Morning, neighbours.
Remember us, the fellows who were here a minute ago?
Oh, yes, indeedy. I never forget a face.
Listen, pop.
We've come all the way from New York to look up Deeds.
It's important. It's very important.
Don't get rough, neighbour. Just ask.
Then please pretend, for just one fleeting moment, that I'm asking. - Where does he reside?
- Who?
Longfellow Deeds. Where does he live?
Oh, that's what you want. Why didn't you say so in the first place?
Those fellows don't know what they're talking about.
I'll take you there.
If they'd only explained to me, there'd be no trouble.
Oh. Will you come in, please, gentlemen?
- Is Mr Deeds in?
- No. He's at the park arranging a bazaar to raise money for the fire engine.
Mal, you knew he was in the park.
Yeah, but they wanted to see the house.
Can't read their minds if they don't say what they want.
Come in, please. - A cup of tea?
- No, thank you.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
That's very kind of you. - Are you related to him?
- No, I'm his housekeeper.
We'd like to find out what he does for a living.
He and Jim Mason own the tallow works, but that's not how he makes his money. - He makes most of it from his poetry.
- He writes poetry?
Oh, my goodness, yes. Longfellow's famous. He writes all those things on postcards.
You know, for Christmas and Easter and birthdays. Sit down, please.
Here's one. He got $25 for this one.
"When you've nowhere to turn and you're filled with doubt, "don't stand in midstream hesitating,
"for you know that your mother's heart cries out, "'I'm waiting, my boy, I'm waiting.'
Isn't that beautiful?
Isn't it a lovely sentiment? Yeah.
Here he is now.
Break it to him gently. He's liable to keel over from shock.
They've been waiting a long while. - Who are they?
- I don't know.
- Mr Longfellow Deeds?
- Yes.
How do you do?
I'm John Cedar, of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar  Budington.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar  Budington.
Budington must feel like an awful stranger.
- Mr Cornelius Cobb.
Mr Anderson. - How do you do?
You gentlemen make yourselves comfortable. Thank you.
New mouthpiece. Been waitin' two weeks for this.
Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.
- What can I do for you?
- Will you stay to lunch?
- I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- All right.
- Are you Joseph and Mary Deeds' son?
- Yes.
- Your parents living? - Why, no.
Well, Mr Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Not much. He's my uncle, I think.
I never saw him. My mother's name was Semple.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
He was?
Gee, that's too bad. - If there's anything I can do...
- I have good news for you, sir.
Mr Semple left a large fortune when he died. He left it all to you.
Deducting the taxes, it amounts to something in the neighbourhood of $20 million.
How about lunch? Are the gentlemen staying?
Of course.
She's got some fresh orange layer cake with that thick stuff on the top. Sure.
They don't want to go to the hotel.
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr Deeds.
The whole Semple fortune goes to you. $20 million.
Oh, yes, I heard you, all right. Twenty million is quite a lot.
- It'll do in a pinch.
- Yes, indeed.
I wonder why he left me all that money. I don't need it.
Mr Cobb is an ex-newspaperman. Associated with your uncle for many years, as a buffer.
Buffer?
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
Rich people need someone to keep away the crowds.
Then there's the newspapers.
One must know when to seek publicity and when to avoid it.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar  Budington.
I can't think of a rhyme for "Budington". Why should you?
Whenever I run across a funny name, I like to find a rhyme.
Don't you? No.
- I've got one for Cobb.
There once was a man named Cobb who kept Semple away from the mob.
Came the turn of the tide, Semple died. Now poor Cobb's out of a job.
- Sounds like two weeks' notice to me.
I've gotten the sackeroo in many ways, but never in rhyme.
- I don't mean that. I'll need your help.
- That's different, if it's just poetry.
- Are you married? - Who, me?
No.
No, he's too fussy for that. That's the matter with him.
There's lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls...
Don't pay any attention to her.
He's got a lot of foolish notions about saving a lady in distress.
Now, you keep out of this.
Saving a lady in distress, eh?
We all have dreams like that when we're young.
Incidentally, we'd better get started.
- What for?
- You're going to New York with us.
- When?
- Four o'clock.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs Simpson.
She went to Niagara Falls last year.
I'm nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life.
- Like to see Grant's tomb.
- I understand. We'll meet you at the train at 4.00.
Congratulations, Mr Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country.
See you later. - See you later, kid.
- Good day, sir.
Did you hear what he said?
Know how much 20 million is?
I don't care.
You sit there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
I can't find him.
I looked everywhere. His house is locked up.
- A change of heart.
- He wasn't anxious to come. Here comes the train.
- Look. - What?
That tuba player.
Well... now I've seen everything.
Goodbye, Mrs Meredith!
Goodbye, Jim!
Bye, Buddy!
Gosh, I got a lot of friends.
- Have a drink?
- No, thanks.
- Cigar?
- No, thank you.
I wouldn't worry if I were you.
A large portion like this entails great responsibility, but you'll have help.
So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
- I wasn't worried about that.
I was wondering where they're gonna get another tuba player for the band.
- Hello, John. Where you been?
- I've been fishing.
Good morning, Mr Cedar.
Good morning.
Where are they?
- Waiting for you.
- Good morning, Mr Cedar. - Good morning.
- Morning.
- Hello, boys.
- Well, what's he like?
We've nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
Close that door.
- Get Mrs Cedar on the phone.
- What happened?
The smartest thing I did was to make that trip.
- Did you get?
- No, but I will get the power of attorney.
I asked him what he was going to do with the money.
Know what he said?
Give it away.
- He must be a nitwit.
- You had the right hunch.
- John, we can't afford... - I know, Budington.
We can't afford to have the books investigated.
- What if they fall into someone's hands?
- It hasn't happened yet.
- Half a million dollars, my goodness...
- Will you stop worrying!
I got Semple to turn it all over to us.
And who got power of attorney from him?
All right, then I'll get it again.
Take it easy. Those books will never leave this office.
Yokel. Nothing but a yokel.
Your uncle was mad leaving all that money to him.
You're as closely related to him as he is, and what did you get?
- I say, what did you get?
- Stop yelling. - He didn't like me. - I told you to be nice to him.
Ten years we've waited for him to kick off.
Then we were gonna be on Easy Street. Yeah, on Easy Street.
- It's too late now. You're a nuisance.
- That's just what I'm gonna be. Until I get some of that money.
He's news! Every time he blows his nose, it's news.
A corn-fed bohunk falling into the Semple fortune is hot copy.
It's gotta be personal with an angle.
What does he think about?
How does it feel to be a millionaire?
What does he think of New York?
Is he smart, dumb?
He's been here three days. What have you brought in?
- A halfwit could've done better.
- We tried...
Am I talking too loud or annoying anybody?
You know Corny Cobb. He's keeping him under lock and key.
Never mind. Use what little brains you've got. Find out something for yourselves, you imbecilic stupes.
Now get out of here before I really tell you what I think of you.
- What was that?
- I said you had dirty plaster.
You too.
Thought I could depend on you, but you're as bad as the rest.
- Look. I can do it. - What's gotten into you, Babe?
You'd blast this town open before letting Cobb get away with this.
He's not getting away with anything.
Get some stuff on him and you can have...
- A month's vacation?
- With pay. With pay?
Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow. I'll keep the whole front page open.
- What are you gonna do?
The first time I ever had a suit made on purpose.
It's merely a suggestion, Mr Deeds, but if you give me power of attorney, we'll take care of everything.
Everyone will try to sell you something.
There have been a lot of them already.
Strange people.
Salesmen, politicians, all want something.
Haven't had a minute to see Grant's tomb.
Your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing.
He travelled, enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you want to handle my investments?
- Yes. That is to say...
- How much extra would it cost?
- No extra charge.
- That's a lot of extra work.
But that's a service Cedar, Cedar, Cedar  Budington usually donates.
Budington. I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the boardroom.
They're getting a trifle impatient.
I forgot.
What do they want?
Your uncle was chairman. They expect you to carry on.
I'll tell them to keep their shirts on and that you'll be down.
Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason yet?
Jim Mason?
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though.
Here it is. "Arthur's been with the tallow works too long.
"Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Send it. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Sure, we don't want to fire Arthur.
Arthur was the last baby my father delivered.
You ought to give this matter some thought.
I mean about the power of attorney. Oh, yes, I will. I'll give it a lot of thought.
A fellow named Winslow here wanted to handle my business for nothing too.
Puzzles me why they want to work for nothing.
It isn't natural. I'd better think about it some more.
That's that.
You go to an awful lot of work to keep a fella warm.
- Yes, sir.
- A Mr Hallor to see you, sir. - Hallor?
Don't let him in.
- Why not? Who's he?
A lawyer representing a woman. A claim against the estate.
If he has a claim, we'd better see him. Send him in.
He'll cause you a lot of trouble.
How can he make trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
- I told you to take this up with me.
- I'm tired of being pushed around. I don't care how important you are.
- I represent Mrs Semple.
- Mrs Semple?
Your uncle's common-law wife has a claim.
- Let the courts decide...
- You wouldn't dare take this to court.
I'll leave it to you.
Would any court not be in sympathy with a woman who gave up her best years for your uncle?
- What kind of wife did you say?
- Common-law wife.
- On top of that, there's a child.
- Child? My uncle?
Yes, sir.
That's awful. She should be taken care of.
Glad to see you're willing to be reasonable.
As his wife, she should have the money. I don't want it...
Don't make any rash promises.
That opera mob is about to break into the mad song from Lucia.
I don't wanna keep them waiting.
- Very good, sir.
- I can't go down like this.
Go along with me, Cobb. They're strangers to me.
- What about it, Mr Deeds?
Oh. You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Do the opera people always come here for meetings?
- Uh-huh. - Why's that?
Why do mice go where there's cheese?
I'm led to believe the young man's quite childish.
We'll have no difficulty getting the entire amount. - After all, it's only $180,000.
- Excellent idea.
We're very fortunate the young man is so sympathetic toward music.
He plays the tuba in the town band.
- Here he comes.
The first order of business will be electing a new chairman of the board.
As a gesture toward the best friend that opera ever had, the late Mr Semple, it's fitting his nephew, Longfellow Deeds, be made our next chairman.
- I therefore nominate him. - Seconded.
- All those in favour?
- Aye!
Carried.
Our congratulations, Mr Deeds.
- I'm chairman?
- Yes. You've just been elected.
- I'm chairman! - Happy voyage.
Right here, Mr Deeds.
- Next, the secretary's minutes. - Move we dispense with it.
- Seconded.
- All in favour?
- Aye!
- I think they can be dispensed with.
- Now, the treasurer's report.
- Dispense with it. - Seconded.
- All in favour?
Quite right.
Now, gentlemen, the next order of business... Just a minute.
What does the chairman do?
Well, the chairman presides the meeting. That's what I thought.
But, if you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the treasurer's report.
The treasurer reports a deficit of $180,000 for the current year.
A deficit?
We lost that much?
You see, Mr Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
- It isn't? What is it conducted for?
- It's an artistic institution.
- We own an opera house, don't we?
- We do.
- And we give shows?
- We provide opera.
- But you charge? You sell tickets?
- Of course.
- And it doesn't pay? - Impossible.
The opera has never paid.
Well, we must give the wrong kind of shows. There isn't any wrong or right kind.
Opera is opera.
I guess, but I wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money.
That's not common sense.
Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you. - Me?
- Naturally.
Excuse me, gentlemen. There's nothing natural about that.
Fire engine!
Gee, that was a pip! We're gonna have one like that in Mandrake Falls soon, with a siren too.
Where were we?
The opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
- Why not?
- Because it just isn't a business.
Maybe not to you, but it certainly is to me, if I have to make up a loss of $180,000.
If it's losing that much, something's wrong.
Maybe you charge too much, sell bad merchandise.
A lot of things.
You see, I expect to do a lot of good with that money, and I can't afford to put it into anything I don't look into.
That's my decision for the time being, gentlemen.
Goodbye, and thank you for making me chairman.
Gentlemen, you'll find the smelling salts in the medicine chest.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
- What about it?
- I turned them down, naturally.
- No, I mean about my client.
- Oh. We'll have to do something about her.
- Tails tonight, sir?
- Tails?
Why, that's a monkey suit.
You want people to laugh at me?
I've never worn one.
Goodbye, and thank you, sir.
Goodbye. Wants me to wear a monkey suit.
- We don't want to appear greedy. - Huh?
- I say, we don't want to appear greedy.
- What are you doing?
- Assisting you, sir.
I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants.
Get up from there.
Imagine that. Holding the ends of my pants.
Mrs Semple is entitled to one third of the estate.
- Don't ever get on your knees again.
- No, sir.
What'd you say?
Mrs Semple is entitled to one third of the estate.
One third? That's about $7 million.
Well, we didn't expect that much.
I can get her to settle for one million.
Take up any settlement talk with my office.
I'll do no such thing.
There's only one place you're going, and that's out the door.
- You're making a mistake.
- Oh, no, I'm not. I don't like your face.
Besides, there's something fishy about settling for a million when you can get seven million.
I'm surprised Mr Cedar, who's supposed to be smart, couldn't see through that.
Now, wait a minute, buddy!
One nice thing about being rich, you ring a bell and things happen.
When the servant comes in, I'll ask him to show you to the door.
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere. We've got letters.
- Show Mr Hallor to the front door. - Yes, sir.
There isn't any wife, there aren't any letters, and you're a crook, so you'd better watch your step.
I can't hold out any longer. - Lamb bites wolf. Beautiful.
- It's only common sense.
I can't hold out any longer either. Being your attorney will be very simple.
You're not my attorney yet, not till I find out what's on your mind.
Get the books straightened out so I can have a look at 'em.
Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This will be daily routine.
If it becomes annoying, you let me know.
Goodbye, Mr Deeds.
Goodbye, sir.
Even his hands are oily.
Tonight, what would you like in the way of entertainment?
Entertainment?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones. Tall and stately. How would you like yours?
Dark or fair?
Tall or short?
Fat or thin?
Tough or tender?
- What are you talking about?
- Women. Ever heard of 'em?
- Name your poison, and I'll supply it.
- Some other time, Cobb. OK.
You're the boss. When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you.
- He talks about women like cattle.
- Every man to his taste, sir.
Are all these stories I hear about my uncle true?
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as 20 in the house at the same time.
- Twenty?
What'd he do with 'em?
- That is something I never found out.
- Hey! You going out?
- Yes. Isn't that all right? No.
You never go out without telling us.
- Who are you?
- We're your bodyguards.
Mr Cobb said stick to your tail.
That's very nice, but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail.
Sorry, mister. Orders is orders.
We get you up in the morning, put you to bed at night.
No matter what we see, we don't see nothin'
- That's gonna be fun. - Some people like it.
- Will you do something for me first?
- Sure. Put that away, slug. At your service.
- Would you get my trunk out for me? - Certainly.
With pleasure.
We're your bodyguards! You can't do this!
There he is.
- That's him. - That's who?
- Get your cameras, follow me. - What you gonna do?
Never mind. Grab whatever you can get.
It's gonna be the same old thing. - That dame's nuts.
- Right.
You fainted.
Oh, did I?
I'm sorry. - Can I help you?
- No, thank you. I'll be all right.
This is my house. I'd like to...
Oh, no, really, I'll be all right.
- What happened?
- Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day.
I found one too. I start tomorrow. You've been awfully kind.
Hey! Taxi!
Hey, Stu, follow that cab they just got into, will ya? - Hurry up! Step on it!
- Come on, let's go!
Feel better now?
This tastes so good. I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Tell me more about yourself.
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell.
My folks live in a small town near Hartford.
I'm down here alone trying to make a living.
I'm really just a nobody.
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
- What?
- Nothing.
Waiter.
- Has anybody come in yet? - Uh, no.
Nobody important.
Be sure and point them out to me.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
I write poetry.
Well... you've been having quite an exciting time, haven't you?
With all these meetings, business deals, society people.
- Haven't you been having fun?
- No. That is, I didn't until I met you. I like talking to you, though.
Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
- Brookfield's just come in.
- Who? The poet?
Where?
Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.
- Look, there's Brookfield, the poet.
- Really?
Pardon. Longfellow Deeds, who inherited the Semple fortune, wants to meet you. Oh, yes.
I read about him. He writes poetry on postcards.
Invite him over. Might get a couple of laughs.
- Getting rather dull around here.
- It's always dull here. - I'll get him.
- Good.
Mr Henneberry. Mr Morrow.
Bill. This is Mr Deeds and his fiancée from Mandrake Falls.
How do you do, Mr Deeds?
Nice of you to ask us to come and sit with you.
Back home we never get to meet famous people.
- Waiter, a little service here.
- Yes, a drink for Mr Deeds.
- I don't want it, thank you.
- All poets drink.
How do you go about writing your poems?
We are very interested in one another's methods.
Do you have to wait for an inspiration, or do you just dash it off?
- Well, I... - Morrow just dashes them off. Yeah.
That's what my publishers have been complaining about.
- Well, your readers don't complain.
- Oh. Thanks.
How about you, Mr Deeds?
Well, I write mine on order.
The people I work for tell me what they want, and then I write it.
Amazing!
Why, that's true genius.
Have you any peculiar characteristics when you're creating?
- Well, I... I play the tuba.
I've been playing the harmonica for 40 years. Didn't do me a bit of good.
You wouldn't have one in your pocket?
What, a tuba?
No, a postcard with one of your poems on it. - Oh, no.
- You don't carry a pocketful with you? Oh, too bad.
I was hoping you'd autograph one for me.
- I was too.
- Now, wait a minute, boys. Perhaps Mr Deeds would recite one for us.
That's a very good idea.
Nothing like a poet reciting his own stuff.
How about a Mother's Day poem? Exactly.
Give us one that rings the great American heart. Yes. Go ahead.
I get the idea. I know why I was invited here. To make fun of me.
- Oh, not at all.
- Don't be ridiculous. - Look, he's temperamental.
- What if I am? What about it?
It's easy to make fun of somebody if you don't care how much you hurt 'em.
Your poems are swell, Mr Brookfield, but I'm disappointed in you.
I must look funny to you, but if you went to Mandrake Falls you'd look as funny, only nobody'd laugh at you, because that wouldn't be good manners.
Maybe postcard poems are comical, but people think they're good.
Anyway, it's the best I can do.
So if you'll excuse me, we'll be leaving.
I guess I found out that all famous people aren't big people.
And if it weren't for Miss Dawson, I'd bump your heads together.
Oh, I don't mind.
Then I guess maybe I will.
Eureka!
Step aside.
Say, fella, you neglected me and I feel very put out.
Look, sock it right there, will ya? Sock it hard.
- I've got it off my chest.
- Oh, listen. The difference between them and me is I know when I've been a skunk.
You take me to the nearest news-stand and I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness!
Pal, you've added ten years to my life.
A poet with a straight left and a right hook? Delicious. Delicious.
You're my guest from now on, for ever and a day, even unto eternity.
- Thanks, but we're going sightseeing.
- Fine. Fine. Swell.
Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet... Thanks...
I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Grant's tomb and the Statue of Liberty?
You'll not only see those, but before the evening's through, you'll be leaning against the Tower of Pisa, mount Mount Everest.
I'll show you the pyramids and all the sphinxes.
Pal, how would you like to go on a real old-fashioned binge?
- Binge?
- Yeah, I mean the real McCoy.
Play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, nitwit and halfwit in New York.
We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia look like an anaemic on a goat's milk diet.
- That oughta be fun, huh? - Fun? Say...
Listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and a joy for ever.
Boy? Boy, my headpiece! O Tempora!
O Mores!
O Bacchus! - Oh, you're drunk.
- Oh, you're right!
- If we go with him, we'll see things. - I guess we will.
"'I play the tuba to help me think.'
"A statement made by Longfellow Deeds, New York's new Cinderella Man,
"who last night proved that his late uncle from whom he inherited $20 million,
"was an amateur in the art of standing the town on its cauliflower ear."
"Cinderella Man." That's sensational, Babe, sensational.
Took some high-powered acting. - Did it?
- I was the world's sweetest ingenue. Is he really that big a sap?
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
"Cinderella Man." That'll stick to him for the rest of his life.
Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
If we sold tickets, we'd make a fortune.
- How'd you get the picture?
- Had the boys follow us.
Marvellous. " At two this morning, Mr Deeds tied up traffic
"while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse.
"When asked why, he replied,
"'To see how many doughnuts the horse would eat before he asked for coffee.'
Beautiful! What happened after that?
I had to write the story.
He was so drunk he never missed me.
When are you gonna see him again?
Tonight, maybe. I'll phone him at noon.
My lunch hour...
- I'm a stenographer. Mary Dawson.
- You're a genius, Babe, a genius.
I moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment, in case Cobb might start looking around.
Good. Don't show your face here. I'll say you're on vacation.
No one'll know where the stories are coming from.
You can get an exclusive out of him every day.
We'll have the other papers crazy. - Babe, I could kiss ya!
- Oh, no. No. - Our deal was for a month's vacation.
- Sure. - With pay.
- You'll get it, Babe.
Mr Deeds. Mr Deeds, sir.
You really must get up. It's late.
- You're Walter, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.
Just wanted to make sure.
If you'll permit me to say so, sir, you were out on quite a bender last night.
Bender?
You're wrong, Walter.
We started out to a binge, but we never got to it.
Yes, sir.
- What's that?
- A prairie oyster, sir. Prairie oyster?
Yes, sir.
It makes the head feel smaller.
- Has Miss Dawson called yet?
- No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
She was the lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her.
- Had a lot of pride. I like that. - Oh, I do too, sir.
I'd better call her up and apologise. I don't remember taking her home.
I'd venture, you don't remember much of what happened last night, sir.
What do you mean?
I remember everything.
Hand me my pants. I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
You have no pants, sir. You came home last night without them.
- I did what?
- You came home without any clothes. You were in your shorts.
Yes, sir.
I couldn't walk around on the streets without any clothes.
I'd be arrested.
- That's what the two policemen said.
- What two policemen?
They brought you home.
They said you kept walking up and down the street shouting, "Back to nature!
Clothes are a blight on civilisation! Back to nature!"
Listen, Walter, if a man named Morrow calls up, tell him I'm not in.
He may be a great author, but... I think he's crazy.
The man's crazy, Walter!
Yes, sir.
Oh, by the way, did you?
- The knee.
- But how will I put on the slipper, sir?
Yes, sir.
I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
Looking for?
You kept searching my pockets last night, sir. You said you were looking for a rhyme for "Budington".
- Better bring me some coffee. - Very good, sir.
I beg pardon. A telegram came for you, sir.
I'll get you some black coffee, sir.
Did you see all this stuff in the paper?
- Arthur wants to quit.
- Arthur? Who's Arthur?
He's the shipping clerk at the tallow works. Wants a $2 raise, or he'll quit.
What do I care? Did you see this stuff in the paper?
How did it get in there?
What did you do last night?
What did you do to those bodyguards?
Said you locked them up.
- They insisted on following me.
- What do you think bodyguards are for?
- What do they mean, "Cinderella Man"?
- Are those stories true?
"Cinderella Man"?
They'd call you anything if you gave 'em a chance.
They got you down as a sap.
- I'll punch this editor in the nose.
- No, you don't! Get this clear. Socking people in the nose is no solution for anything.
- Sometimes it's the only solution.
- Not editors. Take my word for it.
- If they're gonna poke fun at me...
- Listen, Longfellow.
You got brains, kid.
You'll do swell if you curb your homicidal instincts and keep your trap shut.
These newshounds are gunning for you.
- What about this "Cinderella Man"?
- I'll take care of that, if you'll help me.
But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people.
Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
- Yes, I guess I'll have to.
If you feel the building rock, it'll be me, blasting into this editor.
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
- Miss Dawson on the phone, sir. - Who? Miss Dawson?
- Yes, sir. - Fine.
Give me the phone, quick.
She's the only one I'm gonna talk to.
- Awfully nice of you to show me around. - I enjoy it.
The aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go every day.
I bet you do.
I'd like to, but I have a job to think of.
- You'd better keep following that bus! - Keep your shirt on!
- No pictures tonight.
- I oughta get him drunk again.
Got any news? I mean, has anything exciting been happening lately?
Sure. I met you.
What's happening about the opera?
Oh, that. We had another meeting. I told 'em I'd be chairman if...
- I'm chairman, you know.
- Yeah, I know.
I told 'em I'd play along if they lowered prices, cut down expenses and broadcast.
What'd they say?
Gee, you look pretty tonight.
- What'd they say?
- Huh? Oh. They said I was crazy, that I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
- What are they going to do?
- Do you always wear your hair like that?
Isn't it a scream?
"Cinderella Man." The dope.
I'd like to get my hooks into that guy.
Someone's probably taking him for plenty.
If they were men, I'd knock their heads together.
- Have you seen the papers?
That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings.
I'd like to punch the fella in the nose that's writing that stuff.
"Cinderella Man."
Pretty soon everybody'll be calling me Cinderella Man.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out. - Yes.
- Yeah, let's.
Hey, wise guys, he's getting off.
Come on, pull up to the kerb!
Oh, come on. Don't you want to see it?
Well, feast your eyes. Grant's tomb.
Is that it?
Hey, beetle puss. The tomb.
Well, there you are. Grant's tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
- It's wonderful.
- To most people it's an awful let-down.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
That depends on what they see. - And what do you see?
Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier.
I see thousands of marching men.
I see General Lee, with a broken heart, surrendering.
I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said.
And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as president.
Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
Excuse me.
Sorry, Mr Hopper. Mr Cedar won't answer his phone.
What's going on?
The three C's and B have been in there over an hour.
I don't want to be critical, but...
I know. We haven't got power of attorney.
- But you said...
- I can't strangle him, can I?
It's ridiculous for us to worry about him.
Look at these articles. "Cinderella Man."
- He's carrying on like a idiot.
- Exactly what I said...
Who cares?
- Yeah?
- Mr and Mrs Semple are waiting.
- Let 'em wait.
- They've been in every day this week.
- Who?
- Relatives of old man Semple.
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value. - Nuisance value?
- If not for Deeds, they'd be rich.
Nuisance value... Maybe they have. Maybe they have, maybe they have...
Mr and Mrs Semple, please. How do you do?
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.
What was my secretary thinking, keeping you waiting this long?
- Will you have a cigar, Mr Semple? - Thanks.
- There's Times Square.
- You can almost spit on it. Why don't you try?
It's breezy up here.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you?
Oh, I'm not worrying any more. They'll go on writing 'em until they get tired.
You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
- They just do it to sell the newspapers.
- Yeah, I guess so.
What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other.
Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
Shall we go?
Here's a nice place.
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
You said something to me when you first met me I've thought about a great deal.
- What's that?
- You said I was a lady in distress.
Oh, that. - What did you mean by that?
- Nothing.
Have you got a?
Are you engaged or anything?
- No. Are you?
- No.
- You don't go out with girls very much.
- I haven't. - Why not?
- Oh, I don't know.
You must've met a lot of society girls.
Don't you like them?
I haven't met anybody here that I like particularly.
They all seem to have St Vitus' Dance. Except you, of course.
People here are funny.
They work so hard at living, they forget how to live.
Last night, after I left you,
I was walking along, looking at the tall buildings, and I got to thinkin' about what Thoreau said.
"They created a lot of grand palaces here,
"but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them."
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
- I'm from a small town too, you know. - Really?
- Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
- What do you know about that!
It's a beautiful little town, too.
Grove poplar trees right along main street. Always smells as if it just had a bath.
- I've often thought about going back.
- You have?
Oh, yes.
I used to have a lot of fun there. I loved going fishing with my father.
You know, that's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. He talked like you, too.
Sometimes he let me hold the line while he smoked.
We'd just sit there for hours.
After a while, for no reason, I'd go over, kiss him, sit in his lap.
He never said very much, but once I remember him saying,
"No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
He sounds like a person well worth knowing.
- He played in the town band, too. - He did?
- I play the tuba. - Yeah, I know.
- What did he play?
- Drums.
He taught me to play some. - He did?
- Mm-hmm. I can do Swanee River. - Would you like to hear me?
- Oh, I suppose you could do better. - Sure. I can sing Humoresque.
I bet you don't even know how it goes. Sure.
You sing it over again, and I'll do Humoresque with it.
- You better be good.
- Do they want to make it a quartet?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Fire engines.
Fire engine! I wanna see how they do it.
Wait for me.
Looks like the evening won't be wasted.
Hello. What do you want?
Captain Deeds, fire volunteer, Mandrake Falls.
Hi, Cap. Boys, meet the captain.
- What's the matter, hon?
- Nothing.
What's up, Babe?
Something's eatin' you. No, it's nothing.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's wrong.
Don't be ridiculous.
You haven't gotten very far. That's where you were an hour ago.
Let's go down to Joe's. The gang's waitin'
I can't write it. I don't know what's the matter with me.
Hello? Yeah, she's here. Who wants her?
Who?
Oh, yes. Yes, just a moment.
It's him.
Whatchamacallit. The Cinderella Man.
The Cinderella Man.
Couldn't sleep. Wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
No, not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.
I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes I've met.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
You know what I've been doin' since I got home?
I've been workin' on a poem. It's about you.
Sometimes it's kind of hard for me to say things, so I write 'em.
I'd like to read it sometime.
Maybe I'll have it finished next time I see you.
Gosh, that's swell, Mary. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest imbecile in the world or the grandest thing alive.
- I'm crucifying him.
- People have been crucified before.
- Why do we have to do it?
- You started out to be a success.
- Then what?
- Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak.
Do you know what he told me tonight?
When he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold.
The guy's barmy. Is he?
Yeah, I thought so too. I tried to laugh, but it stuck in my throat.
Cut it out, will ya? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
Of course you don't. We've forgotten.
We're too busy being smart alecs. Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
I beg pardon, sir.
- Madame Pomponi is on the telephone. - Who?
She says everything is all set for the reception.
Don't come in when I'm playing.
- She's on the telephone.
- Get out. The evil finger's on you. - The finger, sir?
Stop!
- Did you hear that?
Why, that's an echo, sir.
- You try it.
Louder.
- You try it.
Louder.
You try it.
All together.
Let that be a lesson to you.
Go back to your rooms, both of you.
Hello, darling. - So good of you to come. - Madame Pomponi.
- I'm so happy to have you here.
- I'm dying to see the Cinderella Man. - Shh. He may hear you.
- Even if he did, he wouldn't understand.
- I hear he believes in Santa Claus.
Will he be Santa Claus? That's what I wonder.
- Slippers ready for the Cinderella Man?
- Think he'll go for that?
With $20 million, he doesn't have to have looks.
He won't have it long with that Pomponi woman hanging around.
My dears, I hear that he can't think unless he plays his tuba.
- You're a fool, Babe.
- I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Running away is no solution.
What'll I say if he calls up?
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. Got a job in China, someplace.
- You're acting like a schoolgirl.
- What else can I do?
Keeping this up's no good. He'll find out sometime.
At least I can save him that.
- Where is everybody? - Come on, Babe.
The artillery's ready.
It's those two sore spots again.
- Should've been down to the office.
- Mac threw Cobb out. - Boy, was he burning.
- No, you don't.
One drink, and then we're ready to shoo.
- We're not going out. - You have a date with him.
It's off. He's having a party at his house.
- What's the matter with her?
- You wouldn't know. - Run along. Peddle your little tin-types.
- What? Throwing us out of here is getting to be a regular habit.
Is Mary Dawson here?
I'm Longfellow Deeds.
Yes. Of course. Longfellow Deeds.
You're Mabel, her sister, aren't you?
Yes. Yes. Of course.
Yes, I've been her sister a long time.
- Is she home? - Yeah.
What?
- Is Mary home?
- Oh, Mary.
Yes, of course.
I don't know whether she's home or not.
I'll see. There she is.
- Hello. - Hello, Mary.
I waited in the park over an hour. I thought maybe you'd forgotten.
I didn't think you'd come, with the party.
I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you, so I threw them out.
- You threw them out?
- You mean, by the neck?
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw them out.
That'll be in the papers tomorrow, give them something else to laugh at.
I don't mind, though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
- Like to go for a walk?
- Yeah, if it isn't too late.
I'll get my hat.
Nice day out... Nice night, wasn't it...
Isn't it? Yes.
Lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Yeah. It'd be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Yeah, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk.
- Ready?
- Gosh. - She looks better every time I see her. - Thank you.
Goodnight. I won't keep her out late.
Thank you so much. Goodnight.
- My foot's asleep.
- No, you don't. - Listen, she told us... - No more photographs.
Glad you wanted to take a walk, Mary, 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
Let's just walk, hmm?
All right.
Mary, I'm going home. Are you? When?
- A day or so, I think.
- I don't blame you.
A man ought to know where he fits in. I don't fit in here.
I had an idea I could do something with the money, but they kept me so busy I haven't figured it out.
I guess I'll wait till I get back home.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary?
You don't have to pay any attention.
No, I don't mind.
All my life I've wanted somebody to talk to.
Back in Mandrake Falls, I used to always talk to a girl.
- A girl?
- Only an imaginary one.
I used to hike a lot, and I'd always take this girl with me, so I could talk to her.
I'd show her my pet trees and things.
It sounds kind of silly, but we had a lot of fun doing it. She was beautiful.
I haven't married, 'cause I've been kind of waiting.
You know, my mother and father were a great couple.
I thought I might have the same kind of luck.
I've always hoped that someday that imaginary girl would turn out to be real.
- Well, here we are again. - Yes, here we are again. - Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Mary, I... - Excuse me.
- Goodbye, darling.
Don't let anybody hurt you again, ever.
They can't anyway. You're much too real.
You go back to Mandrake Falls. It's where you belong. Goodbye.
Mary.
You know the poem I told you about?
It's finished. - Would you like to read it?
It's to you.
- Yes. Of course.
You don't have to say anything, Mary. You can tell me tomorrow what you think.
"I tramped the Earth with hopeless feet, "searching in vain for a glimpse of you.
"Then heaven thrust you at my very feet,
"a lovely angel, too lovely to woo.
"My dream has been answered, but my life's just as bleak.
"I'm handcuffed and speechless in your presence divine.
"For my heart longs to cry out. If it only could speak.
"I love you, my angel. Be mine. Be mine."
You don't have to say anything now. I'll wait till tomorrow to hear from you.
Stop it, Babe. Stop it. You're quitting?
You might as well tell me I'm quitting. What's bothering you?
Last night he proposed to me. Proposed to you?
He asked you to marry him? - Yes.
- Why, Babe!
That's terrific!
"Cinderella Man woos mystery girl. Who is the?"
- Print that and I'll blow your place up.
- Sorry, Babe. I just got carried away.
That's too bad. That would've made a swell story. So, he proposed to you?
What a twist. You set out to nail him, and...
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
You haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?
Well, I'll be.
That's tough, Babe. - What are you going to do?
- I'm going to tell him the truth.
Tell him you're Babe Bennett?
Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. - It's going to be pretty.
- You're crazy. You can't do that.
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I hope he does.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again.
That's the rub.
Oh, it's as bad as that?
Telling him's the long shot. I'm going to take it.
Well, it was fun while it lasted, Mac. I'll clean out my desk.
- How's it going?
- Quite all right, sir.
- Gold?
- Yes, sir.
- Fourteen karat.
- Yes, sir.
- Is that the best you got?
- Yes, sir.
Flowers are too high. I won't be able to see her.
- Get a smaller bowl.
- A smaller bowl. - Yes, sir.
A smaller bowl. - Did you get that stuff?
- Stuff, sir?
- That goo that tastes like soap.
Yes, sir. Here it is. The pâté de foie gras, sir.
Fine. Have a lot of it, 'cause she likes it.
Now you got the idea.
That's fine. Sit over there, will you? - Me, sir?
- Yeah.
- You're too tall.
Slink lower, will you? - Yes.
More.
Now forward.
How is this, sir? - Perfect...
Perfect.
- I wish you luck, sir.
Thank you. Now, don't touch a thing.
Walter? - Walter, where are you?
- What is it, sir?
Anything happened?
"Anything happened"?
I got to get dressed.
- But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
- What's an hour? Time flies.
- My tie? - Yes, very good, sir.
Just as I suspected, wise guy.
I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself, but not out of me.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Mary Dawson, hmm?
Mary Dawson, my eye. She took you for a sleigh ride New York will laugh about for years.
She's the slickest two-timing, double-crossing...
- What are you talking about?
- Go ahead. Sock away. And then try to laugh this off.
She's the star reporter on the Mail.
Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story.
She slapped that moniker on you: Cinderella Man.
- She's a double dose of cyanide.
- Shut up!
Babe, I can't let you quit now. Are you going through with this?
This is for you. All the head waiters in town.
You can buy scandal from them at reasonable prices.
I've seen them get in a rut like you before, but they come back.
Hello? Yes? Just a minute.
It's for you.
Soon you'll get the itch so bad, you'll work for nothing.
Babe Bennett?
Just a minute.
- Hello, Mary? - Hello, darling.
Have you been writing those articles about me?
Why, I was just leaving. I'll be up there in a minute.
Look... Yes, I did, but I was just coming up to explain.
Listen, darling. Wait a minute. Please.
I beg pardon, sir.
Should I serve the wine with the squab, sir?
I beg pardon, sir?
If I knew you were going to take it so hard, I would've kept my mouth shut. Sorry.
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
Yes, sir.
You shouldn't be running away like this. What'll happen to the estate?
They can have the estate.
Nobody's going to kick me out.
Let me go! I want to see that guy!
Let me go! I want to see him!
Let me go! There he is. I wanna look at him.
I wanted to see what kind of a man you were.
A man that spends thousands on a party, while people around him were hungry.
The Cinderella Man?
Did you think how many families could be fed on what you pay to get on the front pages?
Let him alone.
If you know what's good for you, let me get this off my chest.
How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse? Got a kick out of it? Got a big laugh?
Ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings? No!
- Shall I call the police, sir?
What do you want?
That's all that's worrying you: What do I want?
A chance to feed a wife and kids.
I'm a farmer. A job. - That's what I want.
- A farmer?
You're a moocher. I wouldn't believe you on a stack of Bibles.
You're a moocher like all the rest, so get out.
Sure, everybody's a moocher to you.
A mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you.
- This won't do you any good.
- Stay where you are!
You're about to get some more publicity, Mr Deeds. You're about to get on the front page again.
See how you're going to like it this time.
What good's your money when you're six feet under? Never thought of that.
All you ever thought of was pinching pennies, you money-grabber.
You never gave a thought to those starving people in the bread lines not knowing when their next meal was, not able to feed their wife and kids.
I'm glad I didn't hurt nobody. Excuse me.
Crazy. You get all kinds of crazy ideas.
Sorry. I didn't know what I was doing.
Losing your farm after 20 years' work.
Seeing your kids go hungry.
Game little wife saying everything's going to be all right.
Standing there in the bread lines.
It killed me to take a hand-out. I ain't used to it.
Go ahead and do what you want with me, mister. I guess I'm at the end of my rope.
Could I take some of this home with me?
- Are you married?
- Yes, sir.
- Any children?
- No children.
I think you'll qualify. Take this to that desk for further instructions.
- Thank you very much.
- Next, please.
- How many does that make?
- You've okayed 819.
- Is that all?
It's going awfully slow.
- We need 1100 more.
Hello? Yes. Yeah.
The water development seems OK. I don't like the road layout.
Come up tonight about ten and bring the maps. Right.
Here's the order for the ploughs. We got a good price.
Fine. Thanks.
I'll look them over later. Mr Deeds, my wife wanted me to tell you she prays for you every night.
Well, thanks.
- How do you do? Your name?
- George Rankin, sir.
No, no, we're not buying any bulls.
What's that?
Listen, fellow. Bull's what I've been selling all my life.
He's ordered me to turn everything over to him.
Work fast, before he disposes of everything.
I told you something could be done.
I knew it all the time. Sign it.
- We may get into trouble. - Don't be squeamish.
There's millions involved.
You're his only living relative.
- What's it say?
- It's your agreement if we win.
My end is going to be expensive. I have important people to take care of.
I have the legal machinery ready to go. I've been working on it.
Say the word, and we'll stop him in his tracks.
- Sign it! - All right.
- Charlie, we're off. Papers all set?
- All set. Go to it.
And Charlie?
Find who wrote those articles and subpoena him.
- So what is your name?
- Christian Swenson.
- Farmer?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Where is your farm?
- South Dakota, north.
- South Dakota North?
- South Dakota, but on the top.
- What about knocking off for lunch?
- Not hungry. I want to get through this work and go home.
What are you trying to do, keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Maybe I'll have a sandwich. Do you mind waiting?
Sure.
If you like to have a sandwich, I can give you one, please.
Thanks. Thank you.
Never mind, Cobb.
Good.
Cobb!
- Get lunches for the rest of them.
- What?
There must be 2,000 of them out there.
- That doesn't make them less hungry.
- OK, Santa Claus. 2,000 lunches.
- Say something. - Go ahead.
Tell him.
Mr Deeds, the boys here wanted me to say a little something.
They just wanted me to say that... Well, they wanted me to say that we think you're swell. And that's no baloney.
- Say something more. - Give me a chance, fellows.
We're all down and out.
A fellow like you comes along, it gives us hope. They just wanted me to say that I've...
That's him. - Are you Longfellow Deeds?
- Yes.
Sheriff's office. We got a warrant to take you into custody.
- A what?
- A warrant for your arrest.
- What's up? What do you wonks want?
- I have an insanity warrant to execute.
- Insanity?
Who says he's insane?
- A relative of the late Martin Semple.
The charges are that Mr Deeds is insane and incapable of handling the estate.
Somebody got panic-stricken? Where are you going to take him?
- County Hospital.
- It's only temporary. A hearing will follow immediately.
That's fine. Just because I wanna give this money to people who need it, they think I'm crazy.
That's marvellous. That makes everything complete.
- Let's go. - Wait. We're going to get a lawyer.
- I'll call Cedar. - Don't bother.
I'm from Mr Cedar's office. He represents the complainant.
- Let's go. We're wasting time.
- All right. But get your hands off me.
Come on. Get back. Step back.
Everybody in town has been here to see him. Yes, sir. I will.
Goodbye. Sorry, lady. It's you again.
- Please. I've got to see him.
- Listen, he don't want to see nobody.
- Will you just give him my name?
- Listen.
There isn't a thing the matter with that guy, till I mention your name.
What are you going to do? Sit back and let them railroad you?
It's as pretty a frame-up as ever hit this rotten town.
If you'd just let me get you a lawyer.
You can't walk into that court without being ready to protect yourself. Cedar's too smart.
With the talent he's lined up against you, you'll cook.
Listen, I know just how you feel. A blonde in Syracuse put me through the same paces.
I came out with a sour puss, but full of fight.
Come on. You don't want to lay down now.
They're trying to prove you're nuts.
They'll shove you in the bug house.
The moment they accused you of it, they had you half licked.
Go on. Sit down, won't you? Yes.
So long, Mr Cobb.
Corny, listen, I've got to see him.
I've got to talk to him.
Haven't you done enough damage already?
Somebody's got to help him. He hasn't a chance against Cedar.
I've got Mac lined up and the paper's behind him.
I can get Livingston.
With a lawyer like that, he's a chance.
You're wasting your time. He doesn't want lawyers. He's so low, he doesn't want help.
You can take a bow for that.
As swell a guy as ever hit this town and you crucified him for some headlines.
You've done your bit. Now stay out of his way.
Cedar wants to make a settlement.
Here's your chance to get out of the whole mess.
Rise, please.
Supreme Court, State of New York, now in session. The Honourable Judge May presiding.
The court wishes to warn those present it will tolerate no disturbances.
Regarding the sanity hearing of Longfellow Deeds...
You represented by counsel, Mr Deeds?
I understand you have no counsel, and you have no intention of defending any of these charges.
Now, if you wish to change your mind, the hearing can be postponed.
Crazy.
Proceed.
In the interest of my client, relative of the late Martin W Semple, we cannot permit the fortune to be dissipated by a person whose incompetency and abnormality we shall prove beyond doubt.
I have a series of articles written by a newspaperwoman, who witnessed his conduct since he came to New York.
She tells how, in mid-conversation, he'd suddenly begin playing his tuba.
She tells of his attack on several eminent writers for no reason.
I, myself, unable to keep pace with his mental quirks and fearful of assault, turned down an opportunity to represent him as his attorney.
This newspaperwoman, who we've subpoenaed to testify, tells how he held up traffic for an hour feeding doughnuts to a poor horse.
We have photographs to substantiate this episode, and others of him jumping about a fire engine.
This scarcely sounds like the action of a man in whom the disposition of $20 million may safely be entrusted.
The writer of these articles, whose integrity in the newspaper world is unquestioned, held him in such contempt that she quite aptly named him the Cinderella Man.
We have witnesses from Mandrake Falls, who will tell of his conduct throughout his lifetime, proving that his derangement is neither a recent nor a temporary one.
We have others who will tell of his unusual behaviour, when he invited great leaders in music to his home and then proceeded to forcibly eject them.
Only recently, when he was in the County Hospital for observation, he not only refused to be examined by these state psychiatrists, but he actually made a violent attack upon them.
In these times, with the country incapacitated by economic ailments and in danger with an undercurrent of social unrest, the promulgation of such a weird, fantastic and impractical plan, as contemplated by the defendant, is capable of fomenting a disturbance from which we may not recover.
It is our duty to stop it.
Our government is aware of its difficulties.
It can pull itself out of its economic rut without the assistance of Mr Deeds.
His attempted action must therefore be attributed to a diseased mind, afflicted with hallucinations of grandeur and obsessed with an insane desire to become a public benefactor.
Your Honour, we would like to call our first witness, Louise "Babe" Bennett.
Miss Bennett, please.
Raise your right hand, please.
Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth? - I do.
- State your right name.
- Louise Bennett.
Miss Bennett, are you employed by the Morning Mail?
- I ask you direct your attention to me.
- This is ridiculous. - Answer the question.
- The hearing's ridiculous. - That man's no more insane than you.
- Outrageous!
It's obviously a frame-up. They're trying to railroad this man for money.
Another outburst and I shall hold you in contempt.
We are not interested in your opinion. You are to here to testify.
Sit down and answer questions.
Proceed. Thank you.
Are you employed by the Mail?
No.
You're under oath.
Are you employed by the Mail? No, I resigned last week.
Prior to that time, were you employed by the Mail?
- Yes.
- You followed the activities of Deeds?
- Yes.
- Did you subsequently write about him?
- Yes.
- Are these the articles?
- Yes.
- Were you present? - Yes.
- Are they true?
They did take place?
- They just make him look silly.
- You saw them?
- That's all.
- It isn't all.
I'd like to explain...
- I submit these articles as evidence.
- Let go! What kind of hearing is this?
Are you trying to persecute the man?
Somebody's got to defend him!
- Please.
- I've a right to be heard. I've attended dozens of cases like this.
They're conducted without any formality. Anybody can be heard.
My opinion's as good as these quacks'
I know him better than they do
One more utterance from you and I shall place you under arrest!
I'm willing to hear anything you say, but it must be done in an orderly fashion.
When you've learned respect, you may return.
Until then, go back to your seat and calm down.
This way, Miss.
Order in the court.
Mr Deeds, have you anything to say in defence of these articles?
Mr Deeds?
- Mark these Exhibit "A" for the plaintiff.
They're rather timid, Your Honour, and wish to be together.
I'll only have one testify.
- Get on with it.
- What is your name, please?
- Jane Faulkner. This is my sister Amy.
- Yes. Amy.
I'll direct my questions to you, Miss Jane. You may answer for both.
Do you know the defendant?
Yes. Of course we know him.
How long have you known him?
- Since he was born. - Yes.
Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
- He was a seven-months baby.
- Thank you. That's fine.
Do you see him very often?
- Most every day. - Sometimes twice.
- Must we have the echo?
- Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane.
Will you tell the court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
- They think he's pixilated. - Yes. Pixilated.
- He's what?
- What was that you said he was?
- Pixilated.
- That's rather a strange word to us. - Can you tell us what it means?
- Perhaps I can explain.
"Pixilated" is an early-American expression from the word "pixies", meaning "elves".
They'd say, "The pixies had got him", as we'd nowadays say a man is "barmy".
Is that correct?
Why does everyone think he's pixilated? Does he do peculiar things?
He walks in the rain without his hat and talks to himself.
- Sometimes he whistles. - And sings.
Anything else?
- He gave Chuck Dillon a thumping. - Blacked his eye.
- And why?
- For no reason, I guess. He always does it.
We run into the house when we see him coming.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
- He sure is pixilated. - Yes. He's pixilated, all right.
Thank you, ladies. That's all.
They kept hollering, "Back to nature!"
I thought they looked harmless enough, so I took them home.
I never thought he was cracked.
I'm a waiter. He kept pressing me to point out the celebrities.
I'm coming out of the kitchen minutes later, he's mopping up the floors with them.
I never figured he was looking for trouble.
He threw us out bodily, but bodily!
We was hired as his bodyguards, see?
But he locks us in a room, see?
If that gets around in our profession, we get the bird.
So I says to my partner, "Let's quit this guy.
I'm very fond of Clarissa. She's a nice horse.
And when he started feeding her doughnuts,
I yelled down to him, "Mind what you're doing down there."
I wouldn't mind, sir, but Clara won't eat nothin' but doughnuts now.
If the court pleases, I call upon Dr Emil Von Hallor, if he'll give us his opinion.
He is the eminent psychiatrist, a great authority on the subject.
He's here on a lecture tour and has volunteered his services.
- Dr Von Hallor. - Dr Von Hallor.
Do you swear the testimony you give before this court shall be the truth and nothing but the truth?
- Name?
- Emil Von Hallor. Take the stand.
Dr Von Hallor, would you tell the court what your opinion is of this case?
This is purely a case of manic depression.
A case of this kind, patients sometimes go on for years before being detected.
You remember, in my last book, there were some very fine examples, especially the young nobleman.
Yes, Dr Von Hallor. Very interesting.
It reminds me very much of this one.
It takes so long to detect them, because their mood changes so often and so quickly.
Now, Your Honour, may I show you? May I use the chart?
By all means.
Below here, they are extremely depressed, melancholy, impossible to live with and often become violent.
From this mood, the manic depressive might gradually change until they reach this state.
Here is lucidity. Here they are normal, as normal as you or I.
Assuming, of course, that we are normal.
Then the mood changes again until they reach this state, a state of highest exultation.
Here, everything is fine.
Here, the world is beautiful. Here, they are so elated...
How to express it?
...they would give you the shirts off their backs.
How would you say that applied to Mr Deeds' case?
The symptoms are obvious.
When he was here, on top of the wave, he felt nothing but kindliness and warmth for his fellow man.
He wanted to have them around him, so he decided to give a big reception.
But in the meantime, his mood has changed. He's now at the bottom of the wave: Depressed, melancholy.
So when his guests arrive, he throws them out.
They are now his imaginary enemies.
Other instances of high elations are when he plays his tuba, when he writes his poetry, when he chases fire engines in a desire to help humanity.
This is contrasted with his present mood, which is so low that even the instinct for self-preservation is lacking.
Your Honour, this is decidedly a case of manic depression.
Thank you very much, Doctor.
Your Honour, we rest.
Are you going to let them get away with it?
He's sunk.
Mr Deeds... Before the court arrives at a decision, isn't there anything you wish to say?
Come on. Don't be a sap.
Mr Deeds...
In view of the extensive testimony, your continued silence, and on the recommendation of the doctors, the court considers it advisable, for your own safety, that you be committed to an institution as prescribed by law.
You need medical attention, Mr Deeds.
Perhaps in a little while... No!
Wait a minute.
You can't do it.
You've got to make him talk.
- I object!
- Please. I know how horrible I've been.
No matter what happens, do this for me.
- Please.
- You said I could speak.
You said I could have my say.
Please let me take the witness chair.
He must be made to defend himself before you decide.
- Take the stand. - Thank you.
- She has no bearing on the case.
- Let her speak.
I know why he won't defend himself.
He's been hurt.
He's been hurt by everybody, principally by me.
He's been the victim of every crook in town.
The newspapers made him a target for their feeble humour.
I was smarter than the rest. I got closer so I could laugh louder.
Why shouldn't he keep quiet?
Every time he said anything, it was twisted around. He can thank me for it.
I handed them a laugh.
A fitting climax to my sense of humour.
- This is preposterous.
- I wrote those articles. I was going to get a raise, a month's vacation.
But I stopped writing them when I found out what he was all about.
He could never fit in with our distorted viewpoint, because he's honest and sincere and good.
If that man's crazy, the rest of us belong in strait-jackets!
- This is absurd.
She's in love with him.
- What's that got to do with it?
- You are, aren't you?
- Yes! Her testimony's of no value. Why shouldn't she defend him?
Typical womanhood.
Protect the weak.
Nobody dislikes the boy. I have a fond affection for him.
- But that doesn't mean to say...
- I can verify what Miss Bennett said.
She told me what a swell fellow this man was.
Anything Babe Bennett says is OK with me.
If you've anything to say, take the stand.
I've already said it. I just thought I'd like to get my two cents in.
Don't be a sucker. Speak your piece.
- I've got a couple of cents. - Sit down.
- I've been with him since he came here. - Sit down!
There will be no interruptions.
- How about us, Mr Deeds?
- What about us, Mr Deeds?
- Order!
- Don't leave us out in the cold!
They're trying to frame you.
- Stop this.
In the interest of Mr Deeds, I have tolerated a great deal of informality.
But if there is one more outburst, I shall have the courtroom cleared.
- Your Honour? - Yes?
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Take the stand.
Proceed.
I don't know where to begin. There has been so much said about me that...
About my playing the tuba. It seems like a lot of fuss has been made about that.
If a man's crazy just because he plays the tuba, somebody'd better look into it, because there are a lot of tuba players running around.
I don't see any harm in it.
I play mine whenever I want to concentrate.
That may sound funny to some people, but everybody does something silly when thinking.
For instance... The judge here is an "O" filler.
- A what?
- An "O" filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's with your pencil.
That may make you look a little crazy, just sitting around, filling in O's, but I don't see anything wrong, 'cause that helps you think.
- Other people are doodlers. - Doodlers?
That's a name for people who make foolish designs on paper when thinking.
Almost everybody's a doodler. Did you ever see a scratch pad in a telephone booth?
People draw the most idiotic pictures when they're thinking.
Dr Von Hallor here could probably think up a long name for it, because he doodles all the time.
Thank you.
This is a piece of paper he was scribbling on.
One minute it looks like a chimpanzee.
The next minute it looks like a picture of Mr Cedar.
You look at it.
Exhibit "A" for the defence.
Looks kind of stupid. But that's all right.
If Dr Von Hallor has to doodle to help him think, that's his business.
Everybody does something different.
Some people are ear pullers. Some are nail biters.
That Mr Semple over there is a nose twitcher.
The lady next to him is a knuckle cracker.
So you see, everybody does silly things to help them think.
Well, I play the tuba. - Nice work, toots!
- Order in this court!
This is becoming farcical.
I demand Mr Deeds confine himself to facts.
Let him explain his wanderings in his underclothes, his feeding doughnuts to horses.
Proceed.
Mr Cedar's right. Those things do look kind of bad, don't they?
But to tell you the truth, Your Honour, I don't remember them.
I guess they happened, because I don't think a policeman would lie, but I was drunk.
It was the first time I was ever drunk.
It's probably happened to you some time. I mean, when you were younger.
It's likely to happen to anybody.
Just the other morning, I read about Mr Cedar's own son, how he got drunk and insisted on driving a taxicab while the driver sat inside.
Isn't that so?
Isn't that so?
- Your Honour, I object. - Proceed.
Now, about the Faulkner sisters.
That's funny, Mr Cedar going to Mandrake Falls to bring them here.
- Do you mind if I talk to them?
Jane, who owns the house you live in?
- Why, you own it, Longfellow. - Yes, you own it.
- Do you pay any rent?
- No, we don't pay any rent.
Good heavens, no. - We never pay you rent.
- Are you happy there? - Oh, yes. - Yes, indeed.
Now, Jane, a little while ago you said I was pixilated.
Do you still think so?
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow. - Always. - That's fine.
I guess maybe I am.
Now, tell me something, Jane. Who else in Mandrake Falls is pixilated?
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls is pixilated, except us.
Now, just one more question.
You see the judge here. He's a nice man, isn't he?
- Do you think he's pixilated?
- Yes. Yes, indeed.
You haven't yet touched upon the most important point:
This rather fantastic idea of yours to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Yes, I was getting to that, Your Honour.
Suppose you were living in a small town, getting along fine, and suddenly somebody dropped $20 million in your lap.
Suppose you discover all that money was messing up your life, was bringing vultures around your neck, making you lose faith.
You'd be worried.
You'd feel that you had a hot potato in your hand, and you'd want to drop it.
Dr Von Hallor here would say you were riding on those bottom waves, because you wanted to drop something burning your fingers.
If this man carries out his plan, repercussions will rock the foundation of our entire government.
Please, Mr Cedar.
Proceed.
Personally, I don't know what Mr Cedar is raving about.
No matter what system of government we have, there'll always be leaders and always be followers.
Like the road in front of my house, on a steep hill. Every day, I watch the cars climbing up.
Some go lickety-split up that hill, some have to shift into second.
Some sputter and shake and slip back to the bottom again.
Same cars, same gasoline, yet some make it and some don't.
I say the fellows who can make the hill should stop and help those who can't.
That's all I'm trying to do, help fellows who can't make the hill.
What does Mr Cedar expect me to do?
Give it to people who don't need it?
If you don't mind, I'll ride on those top waves for a minute.
All you fellows up there, all those who applied for a farm, stand up.
See them?
They're the ones I'm trying to help.
Mr Cedar and Mr Semple don't need anything. They've got plenty.
It's like I see one fellow in a rowboat who's tired of rowing and wants a free ride and another who's drowning.
Who would you expect me to rescue? Mr Cedar, who wants a free ride? Or those men who are drowning?
Any 10-year-old child will give you the answer to that.
Thank you. Sit down.
Now, my plan was very simple.
Give each family 10 acres, a horse, a cow and some seed, and if they worked the farm for three years, it's theirs.
If that's crazy, I ought to be sent to an institution, but I don't think it is, and Mr Cedar doesn't either.
Before the hearing, he offered to call everything off if I made a settlement.
He wouldn't think I was crazy if he got paid off.
It's a lie growing in his warped imagination.
I never heard anything so stupid in my life.
It's an insult to our intelligence to listen to such ravings.
- You will permit Mr Deeds to finish.
- But, Your Honour...
- Anything else, Mr Deeds?
Yes. There is one more thing I'd like to get off my chest.
- Proceed. - Thank you, Your Honour.
Order!
Remain seated and come to order. The court is again in session.
Before the court announces its decision, I want to warn all who are here that the police have orders to arrest anyone creating a disturbance.
Mr Deeds, there has been a great deal of damaging testimony against you.
Your behaviour, to say the least, has been most strange.
But in the opinion of the court, you are not only sane, you are the sanest man that ever walked into this courtroom.
You nose twitcher.
I knew it, I knew it. You...
- He's still pixilated. - He sure is.
SINGING VOICE IN MIDNIGHT
That drama actors of one troupe
How have not come yet till now?
Do you think that he would still come?
I think he would not come
It's our landlord to say that he allowed to reach here tonight
You look
It is all ready in our store
So...
In empty court there flies firefly flows, and in high pedestal there walksn foxs
A person accompanies the lonely light, the sound of night watches knocks the midnight
It is windy and rainy outside, flowers and leaves fall seriously
At the boundless and black mid-night
Who waits for the early dawn with me, and who waits for the early dawn with me
My appearance is ugly as a ghost, my heart is hard as an iron
Only I am alive, I swear I will fight with the devil king of that feudalism
Ah,Miss!
Only you can see through my lifetime
Only you can know my innermost feelings of apprehensibility
You are the moon in the sky, and I am cold star near that moon
You are the tree in the top of hill, and I am that withered rattan on the tree
You are the water in the pond, and I am that duckweed aquatically
No,Miss!
I would like to always be the person in the grave
Give up the fame and gain in this world
I would like to learn that "the history minister"
Write the gravamen in the human life
Oh,Miss!
The day is murky, and the ground is cold
What can I use to show my exasperation?
Only that river's dashing
What can I use to vanish your loneliness? Only this midnight singing
Only this midnight singing
How, is not here
How is there no one and no light?
This is the front door, they will wait here in no case
Go to have a look at the back door
Go, have a look at the back door
Xiao Ou, get on the car quickly

Open the door, open the door
After a while, you saw rain heavily so, do it slowly
You are old but, you are old but this...
Do it slowly, slowly, slowly

Come with me, come with me!
Where is my box?
Everyone does not push
Quiet, be quiet
I go for a trip with director Chen to the garden
You take a rest first
The persons who take a position do not go, and who without a position can go with me.
It stops rain now, we can do not beat the umbrella
Go to see
Walk quickly
It's here
Call the door
You take us to visit inside
Slowly, do not fight
Do not fight
Slowly, slowly
Let me take you
In advance I know this garden in no case, it is bad with this appearance
Otherwise, we will come in no case.
Now the affair is already this appearance
Since tomorrow
Tidy up the garden on one hand, rehearse play on the other hand
This garden is so broken
Be quiet, be quiet
Now we need to speak the drama
We come here this time, everyone is all very hard
Originally we have already played our drama very familiarly in the area of Beijing and Zhejiang
Needless lined up again
But for the sake of keeping with the natives' appetite
We line up one short opera more
The name is Yellow River Love
The story of this drama occurred at the year Jingkang of Song Dynasty
Right here
A man in south shore of yellow river falls in love with a miss in the north shore of yellow river
This miss is called A'bao
Before they still have no matrimony, they suffer a big national crisis
Now this manuscript has already been prepared well
You have a look
Do not rob
The male leading role in this drama is served by Sun Xiaojun
There is a ready-made song inside
Here some persons also can sing it
The music score has already been copied
Now let's practice this song first
Get ready!
One, two
Wrong, wrong
Do it again, do it again
One, two
This song is not a new works
Besides you are good at singing usually
How today you did that?
I did not study the voice of this song
I think I should let myself practice quietly
Well, everyone returns
Xiao Ou, I know that you are already very tired
Let's return for a rest first
No, you return to the house first
I still need to practice the song
I accompany you here
No, I want to quietly practice by myself
You come back
Excuse me?
Does here have other persons?
No, no others
Except me,there is no second person
You hear
I heard that in this ater there usually haunts
Really does there exist such an affair?
Are not you frightened to live here?
What is the matter exactly?
Song Danping
That is the formerly famous actress of Qiuliu play agency
Hasn't she died for many years?
You do not fear, I have already got along with him for decades
Strange, odd
It seems he is teaching me
So you do not fear
Perhaps he is in the mood for helping you
The pursuing troops came, what can I do?
Mama, I am like small bird and can't return the nestcannot come back the nest
Do you be a thief?
No, A'bao waits for me
I am a gentleman
I wish to do the fish in the yellow river not conquerred slave
The conquerred slave can't act at will
The fish can also make a wave
Turn over boats of Da's sons, and don't let them cross yellow river
Don't let them cross yellow river
This time I am successful, it is very grateful for you to help me
I really do not know how to appreciate you
I am unforgettable forever that you give me special kindness
Do not appreciate me
It is for your own efforts
You...
You...
You...
Please sit down
Who are you?
Sit down
You do not need to thank me, it is your own efforts
You...
You...
Do not fear
I am a person
I am similar to you as a person who contains blood,body and soul
Are you Song Danping?
Quite right, I am the famous actress Song Danping 1 0 years ago
But 1 3 year ago fleed from home along Yangtze River
And fought for the freedom but sacrificed himself,this revolution martyr Jin Zijian
It's also Song Danping
This faithful revolution warrior
He did not die
Friend, young friend
You are youth with hot liver,courage and hope
I have waited livelong ten years
Until today I meet you
You are the ideal one in my mind
Now
I want to tell everything of myself to you completely
This is me 1 3 year agos
Who fleed from home in Yangtze River
At that time...
At that time, because the environment is too dangerous
So I have to hide in a clandestine place
At that time, although I only have ten years old
But, I have the courage
I have a decision to fight for freedom
So, I have already been the leader of several thousand revolution youths
In my whole life, also at that time
It can be regarded as my golden age
So, why did you call Song Danping again?
I heard that Song Danping has already died
You...are you exactly a person?
Could you let me see your true character?
No,I can't
You listen to me continuously
Three years later,
The information outside wanted to list me gradually depressed
I changed my name
And joined a new play regiment
And come to perform here
This is me 1 0 years ago
Once I performed a world-famous play here
Red-blooded
Who would like to be the slave?
Who would like to be horse and cow?
The fire of humality has been passed through the whole Europe
We are willing to pay any price for the universal love, equal and freedom
Even our lives
Our blood is torrenting like Boer river
We allows the enemy's account excels fierce beasts of that year
But victory eventually is ours, we have no complainment.
Look!
The dark will end soon
Bright have already shot the city head of ancient Rome
Look!
The dark will end soon
Bright have already shot the head of ancient Rome
Younger sister Xia, you mentioned an important affair in the letter
If...
The revolution work that I secretly carried on, was found by others
No, not yet
It's our business that have already been known by my father
It will be disadvantageous to you perhaps
So...
This is that bad thing Tang Jun completely
Because he wants to pursue me
Think that you are his rival in love
So try very hard to provocate in front of my father
Said the drama that you played, scolded the warlord and the duke
Said that it is to scold them while scold the warlord and the duke
It's to scold my father
And he still said you
He said that you are the most inferior person, dramaor
Good, inferior person, dramaor
All right
Younger sister Xia, only I can love you forever
My revolution work is revealed
It is umimportant hat I am subjected the discommode
Elder brother Ping, I know your heart
Also because of it, I just love you
But, if you really had s danger
How can I do?
Younger sister Xia
Now the most fearable affair, it is my father's temperament
While he gets mad
As to persons of the old grudge in normal times, totally he said that they are revolutionary parties
Although now he have already not held an official post
He still keep the touch with the warlords
So it is very easy to do bad to a person
I do not know how many times I saw with my own eyes
It is you
While I thought it, I feel that you are really in danger
Yes, I also thought of it
However for you, for loving you
If sacrifice, I am also willing to
Younger sister Xia, you know
I have no a moment to forget you
Dear younger sister Xia, you do not leave me
Our pair forever are together
What person came?
Younger sister Xia, you leave, quickly leave

Whenever we forever are together
We forever are together
Leave, you quickly leave
Tie up him
Go, take the cordage
You saywhat did that guy say to young lady actually?
Quickly speak out
We told the truth
Report to the adult
While we arrest him
He walked on the road in person
We really did not hear what he said
Young lady, young lady
You can't go
Do not you still know the temper of the master
If you go,
Mr. Song's life will finish right away
Quickly, take the cool water, cool water
Younger sister Xia, I hope that you can understand
Today the master was in an access of fury
Really it's for cherishing you
As I see it, also discommoded yourself
You think carefully
You are a Ms. daughter actually
Song Danpingwhat a thing is he?
We speak with him,
It seemed to lose our body
Even... be in love with him
What thing is he?
What standard do you take to assess his personality?
You do not consider by yourself, what a thing are you?
Don't humiliated the person
Do you want to learn the behavior of the hooligan to oppress the person
You do not take care of my business
Ah, Hooligan!
How did you also speak such words?
Younger sister Xia, you also do not be confuse by others
I,just for taking good care of you, he...
Bad eggs, you dare to take this kind of words to humiliate me
Your this devil
You thought to use this kind of means
You can attain your purpose
Roll out,here has no place for you to stand feet
Nitric acid water?
Grasp the murderer, the murderer is Tang Jun,
Grasp
Grasp the murderer, grasp the murderer
Grasp the murderer, grasp Tang Jun
Damn it, who say that Tang Jun is a murderer
Who said?
This boy
Lift him to go in
Mr. Song
Fortunately Mr. Song's body is very sound
However a little bit crack-up of heart
This is because the nerve was subjected the exciting cause
If recently have no variety
Probably a week later he can recover

This society, this world
I can't met with you any further
Young lady, Song...
Mr. Song died
What?
Mr. Song died
Young lady
Young lady
Young lady
I harmed you
I think originally to interrupt her hope with the death
Who knows that she is so infatuated
Mr. Song ,if you cant not bear to make her pain and suffered
There is a way
Now there are only two persons young lady and wet nurse here
The whole families all moved out
I think that you might as well appear publicly again to comfort her
No
No
No
This is my process
My pathetic process
Livelong ten years
I cover up in this grave by myself
Just as a corpse
I can see her every evening
I imperceptibly drop down the tears
Look
She lives in...
Although I can see her, I can't near her
I have no alternative
Have to use my singing to comfort her
While everu round lonely moonlit night
She always stands to hear here
Since ten years, she has already become accustomed to it
Mr. Song, so
Why do not think a good way
Or...
Or it's to call the person to tell her, say that you didn't die
So she is certain...
No
Absolutely can't
If she knows that I didn't die
She must come to see me
If she sees me to become this appearance
That she...
Friend
Are you willing to do me some favours?
Certainly willing to
Good, good
I, I want to ask you to comfort her for me once
What?
Don't be odd, don't be odd
You see, you see
I...
How can I still near her?
Since ten years
There was not one day that I didn't hope to meet the friend within an ideal
On the other hand
I help other people to success with the knowledage I owned
At the same time
Also hope that the other people can substitute me to do the affair that I did not finish
My friend in the ideal is you, you!
Friend, you promised me
As long as learn my voice, my euphonic
Go to speak with her a few words
She will believe that I come perhaps of
Lo, she is still there
She still waits for my singing there
Go, friend, you go!
You promised me
You promised me
You promised me
Are you Danping?
I know that you will not leave this world
This world also can't be in need of you
Danping
Why did not you use the bright eyes to look at me?
Why not talk?
I am often in those lonely evening
Heard your bright singing
Gave me very big consolation
But, why till today you just walk to me?
You...did you forget me?
Danping
He forgot me
Ms. Li, you do not doubt
Please fresh your suffered and wounded feeling
Don't be so negative for a Danping
Demolished your whole life
Gave up the responsibility as a people
You can't be regarded as knowing the real understanding Song Danping like this
You also can't be regarded as loving Song Danping
Younger sisiter Xia, you still remember
Before how did we encounter somebody else's breakage
Now, how should we go to fight with them?
Danping, Danping failed
But, but you...
You...
Do you still have your power
Do you not say?
We want to fight for our freedom
We want to get our brightness
So you shouldn't give up
We want to put the taste on the whole mankind
Don't only for ourselves
But...
I...
I feel fearful
I can't be without you, I can't leave you
Younger sisiter Xia, do not fear, be braver
Danping all follows you at any time
Younger sisiter Xia, see
The day is quickly bright, brightness will come
You get up with the excitement for Danping
Brightness
Brightness
Brightness
Brightness
Brightness
It's Danping, is really he?
Danping return at?
Young ladywhat rubbish do you speak?
Mother, I...
Yesterday evening, I seemed to see Mr. Song
But, and it seemed it is not him
It seemed that he said some things with me
Mother
Do you say whether he died exactly?
Young lady, how much years did not hear you to call me mother
Do you recover now?
Young lady, do you recover?
You look, my hand
Yesterday evening, I still held hands with him
I really hope that he will come again
I still need to see him
I still need to see him
Young lady
Liu Die, if there is a pair of lovers
They can not reach any aspect of their purposes
Do you think that he would be foolish?
How only is foolish?
If I meet such an affair
I certainly will suicide
Xiaoou, forever we will not separate
We didn't be baffled forever
See the situation of this actors of one troupe, it's probably unreliable
According to old Zhang's words who guards the garden today
Their business is too bad
So the money that they owe us
We go to ask them to pay us
Otherwise their getup boxs are not valuable
I also thought of it
We say with cashier
Settle an account with them hurriedly
Here the mental state and taste of the audience is really hard to catch
The drama of Liu Die can also draw large audience
But she played not several days got sick again
The taste of the audience
Audience
Fortunately the disease of green disc is unimportant
Probably will recover soon
Income in the park for now
At most can maintain five days
Now let's decide so
If Liu Dieof tomorrow can't still take place
So we go on to play three days
If business is not good still, we leave right away
Mr. Song
Mr. Song, we...we will distinguish soon
Don't be pessimism, friend
The situation of your play regiment I know completely
So, I have already thought a way for you to rectify
Remediable way?
Yes
Friend, I thanks a lot for your help to me
Now
It's time for me to help you
Mr. Song, is what is the row exactly?
You think me in this decade
Did you distress only for woman here?
No, in no case
I have ever done many works
Work?
Yes, yes
I wrote very many manuscripts
Contend for the manuscript that strives for the freedom and the liberation
I have already brought for you
Red-blooded
This is my successful work ten years ago
I have already reorganized over its content
Friend, good friend
Give you
I believe that you would certainly succeed
You...you will get the large audience
Xiao Ou, Xiao Ou
Xiao Ou, Xiao Ou
Young lady, this has a name card
Who is he?
He is the landlord here, Mr. Tang
What a big or small landlord, I do not recognize him
The moon tonight is so good too
Why not he still comes?
Elder brother Ping, you did not forget me
I can't leave you
Young lady, before certainly you have a dream
I see that you should drop your worry
Mr. Song, you...
Just I saw no light upstairs
I think, I think you are not in
Mr. Song, I do not know how to say
I do not know how to appreciate you
True, I only have you such a Sir nearby
You give me the prospect, you give me brightness
Sit down
Embrace each other with you at the backstage, what is that miss?
Right, I still forgot to tell you
She is my lover
Liu Die,she is my lover
She is intelligent
She is very beautiful
She...
I know, I know
I know
Xia, Xia, pitiful Xia
But why not tell me early?
You are a person who had the lover
Friend, you is a person who had the lover
Xia, younger sisiter Xia
You suffered hardship for me
You lost brightness for me
I want to consolate you, I want to make you comfortable and happy
So, I sought a
More more hopeful close relative to accompany you
But now
I fell
Everythings all finished
Mr. Song
No, don't blame you
Friend, it is me too reckless
You are a person who had the lover
Wish you successful
See again
But, Mr. Song...
See again
But, Mr. Song, when shall we see again?
Don't know, don't know
It's tomorrow perhaps
Is a lasting future perhaps
Lasting future
Forever will...
Miss Shen, do you know where Liudie goes?
You ask you lover Miss Liudie?
Do not you know?
The landlord here,Mr. Tang Jun likes her
Call her there
You really have the face
Mr. Tang
Ask you to forgive, respect our personality please!
Mr. Tang, this time I came
It's to explain my meaning clearly to you
Please do not misunderstand
Hereafter don't treat me like this again
Joke, respect personality
Do you say that I has a liking for you,
Is not it to respect your personality?
Oh, Miss
You also did not be too silly
Although I adore you
There is a half because I am pitiful to you
You come after these people to perform all over
Have no marriage
How pitiful.
Come after me, lifelong you have a depending
Thank you, Mr. Tang
I have already had a depending
Who do you depend on?
I depend...
I depend on that art with blood, spirit and construct successfully
Ah, art
Where did you go?
I went to Tang Jun's
That what did you still come back for?
You do not misunderstand, I was forced to
Against will, do you still want to beguile me?
Xiao Ou, you know me only
You do not know the reason that I go to
Really it's because person whom they sent
Forced me to go, I have no way
If I refused to see him determinedly
They said that Tang Jun will use a cruelty means to deal with you
Because personal relation of us they knew already
So it is all for you that I went to see him
As well,now still my whole body is innocent
That Tang Jun was on the contrary taught by me
You, why you...
Who believe your that bogus words
You basically have no possibility to explain
Xiao Ou, Xiao Ou
Who
Me, Sun Xiaoou
You, you go out
You think each woman can do your toy
Your this shameless thing
You hurry to roll out for me
Very fierce
Because pity you, just follow and near you
You rise the shelf on the contrary
Today let you know my severe
Help
Come on, come on, tortures of everything all come
The enemy of the public,you
See, see whose judgment day will arrive
See whose judgment day will arrive
Xiao Ou, he...he is Tang Jun
The surname Tang,you did any bad thing with a few filthy lucres
In past ten years
Is it enough that the people were squeeze and devastated by you?
You think others all do not know your actions
You used the paltry trick and harmed Li Xiaoxia, harmed Song Danping
Your this dog..
Dog...thing
Mr. Tang
Can you still recognize Song Danping that you murdered ten years ago?
Song Danping
There is a photograph here
Jin Zijian,a revolution comrade
Is he a revolutionary party
Revolutionary party
Grasp
Grasp
It is not devil that he is a person
It is not devil that he is a person
Everybody, please be quiet, do not hurt him
I have the words to say
Mr. Sun, Mr. Sun
You should understand, Mr. Song wants that you help him
It is not for himself
He needs you to complete his wish
Miss Li, I tell you the whole affair
I am not Song Danping, I am Sun Xiaoou
What?
Mr. Song originally did not die
But he was harmed by Tang Jun, simply was unlike a people
Afraid that you see him to be frightened
So he let the person tell you that he died
Who would have thought that you got critical illness again
After he was the good friend with me
He asks me to comfort you for him
Last time it is me really to meet you
This is all that Mr. Song hopes you can refresh yourself with patience
He...how about he now?
He kills Tang Jun now
At the same time, the warlord aspect also doubted that he is a revolutionary party
Absolutely this time he cannot live
Young lady
Young lady
Young lady
Young lady, young lady
I seemed to do a big dream
I reminded of all things in the past
Now all are before me
Miss Li, the past affair has already passed by
At the same time, the sacrifice of Danping
Gave us a tremendous precept
We should work harder to struggle
And break this dark influence
Fight for the freedom for the public
Complete the wish of Danping's whole life

November1917 In Petersburg, there was bread left for four days.
Comradeworkers,RedGuardsandsoldiers!
In the struggle against hunger we have no one to depend on but ourselves.
ForthesalvationoftheRepublic, the Petrograd Soviet has resolved that the working masses and the soldiers be drawn into the struggle against speculators and marauders.
Personscaughtred-handed, and those proved to be speculators will be shot on the spot by the detachments.
Hands up!
Bakery
Find a witness to record the sentence.
Search him!
Sit there and take it down.
Comrade witnesses and victims!
By order 62 of the Council of the People's Commissars, it is our duty to shoot... this bandit and enemy of the people.
Our proletarian supply detachment calls upon you to sign this sentence.
What's the matter with you, Vikenty?
I was walking in the dark, hit a wire.
Here you are...
And now Prof. Polezhaev... on whom has fallen the mantle of Newton... receives his rations from the new power.
They only issued bread and herring. Thank you so much.
They said in the shop that we were consumers of the 2nd category.
Dimitrij Illarionovich is a consumer, a "mouth" too.
Polezhaev's a "mouth", Pushkin's a "mouth", Tolstoi's a "mouth".
Our "mouth" hasn't had anything to eat.
He's been working at his book, and he's written an article.
He was in such a hurry, he sent the article without rewriting it.
It'll be in the papers tomorrow morning.
And high time!
All our intellectuals are looking to him for support.
If we can only manage to save his book!
Never mind, we'll set it up ourselves if necessary.
I'm afraid to go into his room while he's working.
For God's sake, be quiet, the Professor's working.
- Whose apartment is this?
- Prof. Polezhaev's.
He's busy, he can't be disturbed.
Some people to see you.
I'm busy.
We've come about grain-stores.
In that case you'd better speak to Vikenty Mikhailovich.
He's a specialist on crop-yields.
My specialty is the physiology of the plants.
I happen to be writing a book on the subject.
You are actually interested in the question?
Are you hoarding flour?
By order of the Council of People's Commissars... we are obliged to make a search... with a view to discovering surplus grain-stores.
The city is in turmoil.
The people are starving.
I don't want any lecturing from you.
Where's the flour?
Look where's you're sitting!
That's a manuscript.
What's he doing?
Oh my God!
I don't understand.
That's my book!
All right, you can sit down now.
What are you sitting idle for?
Get on with your search!
Is it an archbishop's robe?
The great Newton himself wore such a mantle.
- Who?
- Newton, the physicist!
Who's taken my pencil?
Oh, here it is!
But people are lifting them sometimes.
Thank you for your article.
What's the matter with your glasses?
He fell when he went to get the bread.
Bread!
Why, that's what they were looking for here.
Did you notice what deep eyes that sailor had?
That sailor just killed a man under my very eyes.
Who was the man?
I don't know. Someone or other stole grain on the railway.
Masha! Is the sailor still here?
Here we sit in warmth and comfort, while he is fighting our enemies.
And I even shouted at him, and didn't apologize.
Prof. Polezhaev, the hireling of the Bolsheviks!
Prof. Polezhaev - a spy!
Prof. Polezhaev has sold himself to the Bolsheviks!
Don't drink unboiled water - the water's poisoned!
The great scientist has extended a hand to the proletariat!
I've never heard of that light before!
Do you know what Polezhaev's famous for?
Oh, he used to keep the ballerina Kshesinskaya.
Come here, boy.
What's that you've got there?
Flour?
Books.
I've come from Siberia, at the summons of the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party.
Now somebody's stolen my kettle.
Bocharov! How are you!
- Is the Commissar in?
- He'll be here soon.
Is that today's Pravda?
May I have a look at it?
"For bread and peace!
Two questions... have come to the forefront during the last month... taking priority over all other political questions.
"The question of bread and the question of peace."
Can you read Comrade Lenin's handwriting?
What's Polezhaev's specialty?
The physiology of plants.
We have very few men like him.
- Is he a Bolshevik?
- He isn't, but many a Bolshevik might be proud to have written such an article.
He's a remarkable man.
We must look after him.
Are you Bocharov? From Siberia?
I've heard a lot about you.
Yes, this is the Smolny Institute. All right, it will be done.
You will be appointed director of a bank.
You went to the university, didn't you?
But I went in for natural science.
All right - take the press, then.
100.000 copies must be printed by the evening.
Don't forget there are lots of Mensheviks in the print-shop.
The leaflet will be printed.
Good!
Prof. Polezhaev must be supported.
He's my teacher.
A splendid teacher!
Go on studying under him.
Lenin wants Polezhaev to be given... all he needs.
The revolution hasn't got many people like him.
I want to see Vladimir Ilyich.
Lenin's gone to the meeting.
Haven't you ever seen him?
Never.
But I've read his letters.
You need an assistant.
Can I have this sailor?
Comrade Kuprianov, hold yourself at the disposal of Prof. Bocharov.
The meeting is over. Let's go to Comrade Lenin!
Colleagues!
Listen to what Polezhaev writes in his article!
"A New Era in History"
You're too late - we know all about it.
The Menshevik group has resolved not to attend Polezhaev's exams.
We will reply to this article by boycotting him.
We will cast our bold protest in his face.
We won't allow them to penetrate the walls of the Alma Mater!
Congratulations on your birthday, Dimitij Illarionovich!
They're preparing to greet you.
Good morning!
Excuse me
- I overslept myself.
I will take your exams in Room 4.
It's a double holiday for me today, gentlemen.
In the first place, it's my birthday - I'm 75 today.
And secondly, I finished my book today.
I shall expect you at my house at 8 o'clock, my friends.
Oh, wait, wait! At eight!
With Tanya, with Tanya!
I'm sure Dimitrij Illarionovich has written a remarkable book.
He may be a great naturalist - but he's no historian.
As a medical man I consider he's in his second childhood.
Well, now I think I really can send the manuscript to the printers.
Do you know, as I was coming here...
I was afraid I should be robbed or be run over by a tram.
I devoted seven years of my life to it!
Well, bring it to the printer.
Is Prof. Polezhaev lecturing today?
Yes. Lecture room no. 4 2nd floor to the left.
I know.
Why are you so unfriendly?
Don't you recognize me?
Cold?
Who's going to give his exam?
Are you nervous?
Have you been lazy?
Bolshevik hireling!
Bolshevik hireling!
German spy!
It's a good thing for you that I'm an old man!
Get out of here!
You too!
May I give in my exam?
Sit down. At least nobody will disturb us.
- Who are you - a student?
- Yes.
How's your book, Dimitrij Illarionovich?
I helped you a little, don't you remember?
Bocharov? Misha?
I would never have recognized you.
Don't tell me that's a read beard!
You must shave it off.
I mean to.
I'm from Siberia. I came to you straight from the station.
Straight from Siberia?
So you've probably forgotten everything?
- On the contrary, Dmitry Illarionovich!
- Well, let's see, let's see.
What a beard!
You look like a senior janitor.
I've come to you about the university print-shop.
The printers' shop's all right - works a lot better than those fellows.
It's printing my book.
Only there's not enough paper.
They're printing your book?
That's a good thing.
Goodbye, Professor!
And what about the exam?
Another time.
Greetings to your wife!
Forgets everything and now shirks...
Makarych...
Boycotting is mere child's play.
I know how to get him to withdraw his article.
Mister Vorobyov, there's a sailor here waiting to see you.
The sailors request you to lecture to them on the physiology of plants.
On board your ship?
With pleasure!
We won't make use of the university print-shop.
We'll get the appeal printed in some other print-shop.
Thateveningtheypreparedtoreceiveguests  in the home of Prof. Polezhaev.
Me at least you can trust!
You have no more devoted disciple... and are never likely to.
Darwin said:
Omni nisi distipulis!
In Russian:
Save me, O Lord, from disciples!
Darwin never said that!
He didn't say it to you - but to me he did.
Arguing again!
I wonder you're not sick of it!
It's Dimitrij's birthday, call a truce!
Make yourself useful and set the table.
The guests will arrive, and nothing's ready!
I stuck to you when you fought the Czarist ministry.
For your sake I risked it all... expulsion from the university, almost exile...
Almost!
Bocharov here did go into exile... but with you it was only "almost".
If we had all gone into exile, who would have been left for scientific work?
For you, life and science were always interchangeable terms... but you have betrayed that principle, you have betrayed your country.
How dare you say so!
I'm sick of you! That'll do!
He's been lecturing me all day!
It's time for your lecture. They're waiting for you on the ship.
I'm not going to lecture to sailors!
What else did you want to say?
Withdraw your article.
Where are you going to in such weather?
To lecture to the sailors.
I blush for my university!
Vikenty Mikhailovich, don't let him go alone!
Take his galoshes.
Dimitrij Illiaronivich, your galoshes!
Our print-shop is being used for printing decrees.
Your book has been put aside.
There isn't enough type.
Why should they destroy a book which was written for them?
I don't believe it!
What about sending the manuscript to Berlin?
I'm going to your ship to lecture you.
Vikenty Mikhailovich's got a toothache, you see.
Where are you going, lads?
To a lecture on the life of plants.
Just now, nothing but politics interest them.
That's all right!
I'll lecture to them about crops.
Please don't disturb me!
Perhaps I'd better go away.
Did I ask you to come?
Prof. Polezhaev will now lecture to you.
The Professor supports the Marxian theory.
He will lecture to you about the life of nature.
He owns his complete works, more than 100 volumes, and it'll be for us all!
What are you going to call them?
Dear Sirs?
Messieurs Sailors?
You're round again, are you?
I'm waiting to see your triumph.
The boys are waiting, Dmitry Illarionovich!
The sailors are waiting for you.
Oh, yes! Thank you, thank you!
Drink!
Comrades!
Comrade - take your rations!
I shall talk to you just as I talk to my students.
I've been working on my book seven years - to make it easier for the ploughman to till the soil.
Many scientists have tried to deliver science, from the yoke of the church and reaction... and to speak the language of the people.
I want to tell you about red pigmentation - the basis of plant life.
I have come to tell you...
Where's Dimitrij?
I don't know. He drove me away.
Perhaps I should go and meet him.
I'm never going to come to your house any more - and nobody will ever come to you.
This is goodbye.
Believe me, I have good reasons for this.
Wait, wait! Don't ask me about anything, I won't tell you anything.
Tell Dimitrij Illarionovich - that I will have nothing to do with his book any more.
Vikenty! Little Vikenty!
I thought you were a bishop, that time. Excuse me, please!
- I was mistaken. I'm sorry.
- Well, here are!
Have you finished your book?
- I have.
- It'll be an interesting book.
- You think so?
- All our chaps think so.
No, don't, I didn't give the lecture for this.
I know. But please accept your ration.
It's my birthday today - come and have tea with me.
That would be great.
Here! Instead of a gift.
Auf Wiedersehen.
- What about having tea with us?
- Too busy. Another time.
Nobody here?
What can you expect?
They're shooting in the streets.
Because of me?
Shooting in the streets?
Shooting at professors?
Why isn't Vikenty here?
Of course...
I shouted at him again.
Yes. He was offended and didn't come.
Perhaps he'll still come.
After all, he knows you're in and screams that you love him.
Yes, yes, he'll come.
I'll make it up with him.
What right have I to shout at people!
It's nothing... don't worry
We're never bored in our home.
Today's a real birthday for me. I've finished my book.
Coming!
Congratulations, Dimitrij Illarionovich.
Maria Alexandrovna!
I beg your pardon. Thank you. Good night!
- Oh my God!
He forgot the bread!
- Who forgot the bread?
I don't know.
It's Vikenty Mikhailovich's bread.
He was here.
It's my bread.
It was given to me as a present.
He said nobody would ever come to us any more.
It's Vikenty Mikhailovich.
Vikenty?
Sit down and play us a nice gay waltz.
- Have you got visitors?
- You see we have.
I came to congratulate you... and take some things out.
Not just now - we have visitors.
Well, anyway, at least I'm here!
I came to implore you... You're making a grave mistake.
I've heard that already. Say something new.
It was you who taught me...
- To sacrifice myself to science.
- Well, so what!
For God's sake, water!
Thank you.
- Is it boiled?
- You can rest assured it is.
You taught us that science demands honesty of us -
Well, well!
And now you're going in for spectacular stunts.
An original form of congratulations, I must say!
I have always felt... that there was something very serious at the back of your eccentricities.
But I hoped all that would pass as you got older.
And in the meantime you've become 100 years older yourself!
Them have overstepped reason!
You want the Bolsheviks to raise a monument to you?
You won't get a monument from them!
The rebels!
Having lectures read in a boiler room!
You want to figure in history?
You won't!
You have nothing to lose - you can go over to the Bolsheviks.
You haven't got many years left to live.
But I'm still young!
I want to be a great scientist too!
Great?
You'll never be that!
Well, I won't venture to keep you.
Your guests might take offence and leave... and you'll be left all alone... in the gutter with your Bolsheviks.
I'm an old fool.
For 15 years I've been teaching a narrow-minded, worthless man.
You prophesy me death in the gutter?
But I still have the strength to fling you downstairs!
Get out of here, Vorobyov!
Dima, they're shooting in the streets!
I don't care!
Yes, alone... now I'm really alone.
And all because of me.
What have I brought you?
The betrayal of friends, a lonely old age!
You've always been the truest... the boldest, the handsomest.
You're cold. I'll go and get a shawl.
Don't bother. Don't worry.
I want Polezhaev's manuscript.
- The one that's being printed?
- Whatever.
Hand me "Plant science and agriculture"!
Why?
It'll have to be published in Leipzig by Steinkopf.
Scatter the type, it'll have to be used for more pressing work.
Editors, talk a little more quietly, please!
For libeling Prof. Polezhaev, the active friend of the Soviet Power
Got it?
The following periodicals will be suppressed, with confiscation of paper-stocks:
"The News", "Speech", "The Petrograd Leaflet"
Are we thieves?
I have grown bald in the service of the press.
That's not a serious argument.
With sugar!
Thousands of the intellectuals are on Polezhaev's side.
They desire to work for the revolution.
By libeling Polezhaev, you rob them of their confidence.
I have all the information on Polezhaev. You know nothing about him.
I'm his pupil. We won't allow you to throw mud at him.
And now..."The Evening Hour" for 6 months...
Comrade, we need an agitator.
The Baltic sailors have given Petrograd a present of coal.
The people are unloading it.
They're exhausted, there's nothing for them to eat.
All right, I'll be around in the evening.
"The Seeing Eye" and "Kitchen Satire": No renewal of license!
We wrote that Polezhaev's a spy... but at the end we put a question mark.
In other words, we asked a question.
And the question mark fell out while the article was being set up.
Misprints are common occurrences in the printing of newspapers.
How is it that all your misprints are against the Soviet Power?
Have you ever had a single misprint in favour of the Soviet Power?
I'm listening?
Hullo. Yes, this is the Propaganda Section.
Hush!
Comrade Bocharov to Comrade Lenin? Very good!
We'll take your paper.
Comrade Lenin asked you to come over.
It will be used for Prof. Polezhaev's book.
Any questions? None?
Auf Wiedersehen!
- Wow! Unrecognized you! Just a damn.
- It's time for you to go.
I must speak during the break.
We're going to work without any break.
Besides, I can't leave! I have to be here!
Comrade Lenin is expecting you.
You talk to them instead of me.
It's easier for me to load ten wagons than to say ten words.
Tell them that coal is blood in the veins of Petrograd.
The Baltic sailors have given coal to the Petrograd workers.
The plants, the power stations will work,
Petrograd will have light again.
And without light it's hard to work at the benches, or to write a book - and above all, to find the enemy.
Cold?
I'll go and get some wood from the shed.
Light!
That's in honour of my birthday, to spite Vorobyov.
Does Prof. Polezhaev live here?
The next floor.
Michael Zakharovich! Come quickly!
- I thought you...
I raise this small glass with great feeling - on behalf of this festive table - to that table where works... the youngest professor of them all!
Your health.
And as always, Dmitry Illarionovich, on your birthday...
Hush! Light!
Hear that?
Nobody has any use for me at a time like this.
I write, I keep on, but nobody thinks of me.
This is all I got by mail.
The students have drawn me in a German helmet.
"Spy in a mantle", "pig's snout"
Well, listen to this, I really don't like it:
"Old donkey in the Bolshevik stables."
Where are the limits to human stupidity?
It was to be expected of them.
- What?
- It was to be expected from them.
Yes, you're right.
One of them said to me:
"You'll die in the Bolshevik gutter."
Yes. It is to be expected from them.
Will you be long in Petrograd?
I don't know. There's a lot to do. The Party will tell me just what.
And there's no one to tell me what to do.
I shall be alone... with my specimen jars.
I was alone for eight years... the frozen taiga, snow-covered huts, drunken guards... and as a great treat... baked potatoes.
But I knew... plant-physiology would be needed again.
You and I will create a splendid botanical institute.
I thought of you out there, in my exile, and kept waiting for your book.
And you say nobody needs you!
That's not like you!
Can't you take a joke any more?
I lectured on board a ship today.
It appears I can still be useful.
I've given orders for you not to be disturbed.
Your pupils must see to such things.
We must look after you.
Every word of yours belongs to the whole world.
You're a revolutionary authority! You're one of our trump-cards!
Well, we have so many the ships that...
trump is not enough!
Well, we've talked enough. Time to go to bed.
Where shall I put you?
Masha!
On the chairs.
Hullo? Who's speaking?
What?
Vladimir Ilych?
Which Vladimir Ilych? Wait a minute...
Go ahead!
Hullo. Who?
Comrade Lenin?
Good evening, Vladimir Ilych.
No, I wasn't asleep.
Yes, I've entered my 76th year.
I hope so!
I hope so!
No, thank you.
I have all I want. Please don't trouble.
My book's all right. It's at the printer's.
Thank you. My greetings to your wife, too. Good-bye.
Masha!
I have something very wonderful to tell you.
A joyous event.
You were right. It turns out I'm not really one.
Good morning.
I've brought you some visitors.
Where's my manuscript?
It isn't here.
You must be mistaken!
It isn't here?
Prof. Vorobyov took it with him.
When was it?
- Excuse me, I don't understand!
How did all this happen?
We are busy printing an urgent order.
So don't even have enough type...
I found this on the compositor's table.
- What paper does it come from?
- Don't know. - You don't?
"Herald of Salvation" of the Employee's Society.
Vorobyov's at a meeting.
He told us... to scatter the type of your book.
- He did? - Yes, he did.
You will not print any more newspapers.
The print-shop will be placed at the disposal of the Soviets.
I beg your pardon! And who are you?
- Where's the meeting being held?
- I don 't know.
Comrades, who can direct me to the meeting place?
I can!
We will give you three months wages in advance... if you refuse to carry out... your professional duties
By three months, the Bolsheviks will fade out.
Nobody can force you to give your knowledge... your experience, your culture...
Let the doctors leave the hospitals, teachers the class-rooms.
Herein lies out salvation, gentlemen.
I give you my word...
The word of a thief!
That man has stolen my manuscript!
I wanted to save it.
Here it is.
Misha! That's it!
Don't worry! Not a page will be lost.
I declare the meeting closed.
You will leave please.
Refuse to comply!
Many here are under a misconception... and will serve the Soviet power.
And let ill-wishers keep out of my way!
Stop!
You're trampling on a scientific work!
Here you are, for example!
Don't worry!
We shall win the day!
Pick up the manuscript!
I won't!
It's your teacher's work.
Pick it up!
You won't?
You were so brave at the university. Remember?
When the police came, you hid behind a cupboard.
Good morning.
Kindly pick that up.
Thank you.
I'm not afraid of your threats, and I despise their cowardice.
Detain him!
I shall have to detain you.
Toothache again?
It's a pity I'm not a dentist...
Go!
A fine beginning for the 76th year of my life.
Theyear1918openedwith severetrials.
The German troops infringing the truce, advanced upon red Petrograd.
PskovandNarvahad alreadyfallen.
The young Soviet Republic mobilized its forces to repel the foe.
The fifth troop-train has left.
When the sixth is ready, let me know at the Tavrichesky Palace.
I'm going to see Prof. Polezhaev.
- How is he?
- His health is poor.
The Baltic sailors have elected him as deputy to the Petrograd Soviet.
He can't go.
I'm tired, tired!
For 20 years that I hear the same...
As your doctor I forbid you to go.
- You're the doctor!
I'm going out!
- And I won't allow it!
- I forbid it!
- I'm still going out!
My pulse always accelerates the moment I see you.
Well, then!
Very well then, drops and complete rest.
- Complete rest.
- Maybe!
And no going out!
Not going out?
Great!
Goodbye.
Hide his galoshes, or he's sure to run away.
Again I have to apologize to the doctor.
Please don't be angry, Semyon.
You know, he's always like this.
Fee?
I don't want any.
He wouldn't even let me examine him.
He wants to go to a sitting of the Petrograd Soviet.
Don't let him!
His heart's in a bad state.
I am obliged to interfere.
Tie it!
You mustn't go.
You'll excite and fatigue yourself.
But my speech at the meeting of the Soviet is for the whole world.
I'm telling you!
I'll complain to Vladimir Ilyich about you.
I'll say that you were expelled...
Very well, I'll go and get a car for you.
Dima!
The doctor says this trip... will stimulate the action of the heart.
Comrades! The next speaker is Prof. Polezhaev, Professor of Botany,
Doctor of Natural Science of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and Deputy to the Petrograd Soviet from the Red Baltic Fleet.
Dimitrij Illarionovich Polezhaev.
Newton's friend!
- What shall I write?
- Stormy applause.
No smoking please. Prof. Polezhaev isn't quite well.
Dear Sirs!
Yes, yes, I said "Sirs"... because you, workers, peasants, Red soldiers and heroic seamen... are now the masters of our newly-born native land.
I greet you in the name of science, the function of which is to bring about your happiness, present and future.
Correct! Right!
Comrades! There are not many men of science here as yet...
But I...
I keep forgetting things.
But some scientists are still more forgetful.
They forget that they were educated at the expense of the people... and reward them with treachery.
I once had such a forgetful pupil. His name was Vorobyov.
I drove him away.
My heart is tickling away the minutes left to me.
There are not so many of them.
A beloved cause demands a mars whole life.
I'm an old man, I must save every second.
You have more left. But you have more to accomplish.
So you must be purposeful, go straight ahead.
Do not turn aside, or stop by the way.
You prepare the way and the next generation will be able to...
I speak in the hearing of the whole world.
And I consider it my duty to tell you... that I constantly receive letters from the heads of universities, from England, France, Switzerland, and from their governments, offering me money, buildings, laboratories... if I will abandon my country and work for them.
My colleagues may curse me, in their hatred for revolution, but I shall stay here, with my own people, with my government, with my university.
Nothing could tempt me to forego the honour... of participating in the revolution!
The troop-train is here, Comrades.
Communists in possession of arms, fall in!
Baltic seamen to the main entrance!
Red Guards from Bocharov's detachment, draw up in the square.
Good luck to you, Comrades!
I'm an old man, but I'm with you.
So long as I can hold my pen and see to write...
I shall defend the Revolution in my own way.
Defend the great, immortal city of the Revolution!
Do not surrender our Red Petrograd to the enemy!
Farewell, Red Warriors!
Red is an unconquerable colour.
It is the colour of creation!
It is the only vitalizing colour in nature!
Farewell.
- Do lie down for a bit.
- All right.
- Shall I call the doctor?
- You might as well.
Good evening.
The soup will be very nice.
Dmitry Illarionovich, it's me, Bocharov! Can I? - And, Misha!
- How is your health? - Sit down!
- But my coat!
- Well, sit down, sit down!
Sit down.
Wort you be late for the train?
My detachment will pass by, and sing you a farewell song.
Your book is already out.
- Even the foreword! - Yes, yes. - That's great!
I've brought you a letter from Vladimir Ilyich.
From Comrade Lenin?
"Many thanks for your book
"Your remarks against the bourgeoisie and for the Soviets
"Filled me with enthusiasm.
"I remain, with the best wishes for your health,
"Yours, Vladimir Lenin"
- Lenin.
There!
Your health!
And you all want me to write even when I'm ill
Tell Vladimir Ilyich... how happy I am to be his contemporary, how I admire his genius
and I want everyone to know it.
Here they come. Goodbye.
Drive away the enemy and come back soon.
I'll hurry. You and I still have a lot to talk about.
We've got to find a building for our institute.
In the meantime you can draw up a program.
You think I can do everything.
I'll do it the day after we beat back the Germans.
Oh, dear!
When are you going to shave off that comic beard?
As soon as I get a minute to myself.
Let's sit awhile before you go.
Mikhail Makarovich, I'm off!
Sit down!
Go now, or you'll be late!
Auf Wiedersehen!
Restoration Mosfilm 1971 The end timings: Serdar202 @ KG
You think carefully
Can't forget , that is impossible
We thank to those people to help
All right, it is good
You no matter
Because you are always like this
He is so stubborn
May I consider again
Where do you plan to be going
What do you go there and can be done on earth
Who are the people staying here after guaranteeing to graduate originally
You should not forget this
If you go back on one's word now, leave here
Don't come back again
My father
Are you really so cruel
After studying abroad
Though everything is useless now
Leave like this
Do not have other markets
I have other work in Tokyo
You think of either
This fool
Shouldn't regret
Welcome, welcome
Come this way
You have really worked hard
The working environment is not very good
Are the girls here all very good?
All new-comers
Keep you waiting
You have come
Ah, No wine?
You go to take a bottle of wine

Let's revise it OK
Please wake up
If people can not retrieve again once ceasing to be faithful
He will not come back again
Once the man thinks that living on will look for the other outlets separately
I advise him several times
A person has left mercilessly
Look on the bright side of things and click
It is better that this kind of man abandons him earlier
Have heard
I am sorry
I am not a heart that want to injure you
But I do not think this is that one deserves such sad thing of yours, right?
Do not you feel much more relaxed ?
Then request you
Go to quickly quickly That scholar is really a person with ruthless heart
Have gone too far too like this
Say now all these are of no use
It is very damnable to still pretend to have pity on by oneself
He is not individual

You needn't worry about that fellow
All let me deal with
I knew one he looked for back
Don't cry like a fool

Say even more that it is very difficult nearby to find such a family
Do not want some children
It is some reasons to want to stay with me
I have already been used to a person's life

The person like me could not think over anything
Why give up so soon
Yes, even I myself do not know
This is a troubling question
Like a fool
It seems you have not put one's own mood in order yet
Upset by so many things
If not a bit more sober, probably everything has been disarrayed
I think in this way too
Those people
It seems that the god is smart and very sensitive
Some meaning
The head is problematic
Feed and speed up
Come, have a drink
Take the ship for such a long time
Will feel a pain very much
Know
You drink by oneself
You will forget soon
Even if such you
I remember it very clearly
Though you have so beautiful a wife
But does not understand you at all
You lack and say the irresponsible and sarcastic remarks here
Where is that

She will depend on me
Will certainly not betray me
Thing of people who can make clear
See, the child is very interesting

A very lovely fellow

Very obedient
Would you like to sleep
You are still thinking of the thing in the past
It is enough, have already said so long

I am thinking of other things
You know nothing
He is very in pain
I really feel bad
Why
I have understood everything
Hope to let Babe be passed and got the happiness

We are also talking about this just now
? My father
Father becomes the grandfather too now
? There is a grandfather
Glad
Offer
You have a lot of things to do
?
And she will not forgive you on being so apt either
Such a child
How on earth to talk to others
You should think of your own future carefully
I have thought of this one too
But we have even child
I have already decided
Very clear such a reason that this wife should
?
Is it sure to have other reasons that you do it in this way?
? Is it like this that you are?
Enough for father
It is I that ask her constantly
You shut up
This woman
We can not accept such a woman
This is a thing that has no idea
All of us have already registered
Registration
Must change the idea
Bring the registration
I will destroy it
Jinjun
Are the person that comes back you?
It is really too funny
Person like you
At such a grandfather's side
It is impossible for me to entrust this kind of people with my Babe
Under that kind of environment
Can't really imagine that what sample he will turn into coming out
Mei
What do you have to prove?
I am an legal person
Right?
If that is true
I will not lie
Everything here is proving
Come on, get that sun lamp ready.
About 15 minutes is the most I'd advise, Mr. Warriner.
Fifteen minutes nothing!
I need a deep Florida tan if it takes all afternoon.
Give her the gun.
All aboard for Miami, Palm Beach and Point South.
-Hi, Jerry. -Hello, Frank.
-How goes it?
-Fine!
-Like to play a little squash?
-No, thanks.
You're awfully white-skinned for a guy who spent two weeks in Florida.
-That's what I thought. -What did you do there, carry a parasol?
-Or didn't you go?
-Don't go spreading that around, Frank.
Pulling a fast one on the little wife?
Frank, I'm surprised at you. I'm supposed to have been in Florida.
Supposing one of Lucy's friends says to her:
"Well, why isn't he tanned?" Lucy will be embarrassed.
I'll be tanned, and Lucy won't be embarrassed.
What wives don't know won't hurt them. What you don't know won't hurt you.
I don't want to know. How about coming by the house?
Some friends are coming by for a late breakfast.
I got a better idea.
Come to my place for eggnogs and breakfast... and maybe later we can duck the women and play some golf.
-Swell, boy, you got me convinced. -Okay.
-See you later, Jerry. -So long, Frank.
Come on in!
Hey, Lucy!
That man is here.
Maybe she wasn't expecting you.
No, she's around somewhere. Put your things down anywhere.
-Hello, Celeste. -Hello, Mr. Warriner, you look well.
Thank you, Celeste, and vice versa.
Where's Mrs. Warriner?
Look what I got her all the way from Florida.
-She's out. -She's out?
Never mind. Go get some eggnogs, and we'll find something to drink to.
Come on, gang, enter.
Mr. Smith, look who's here.
Come on, boy.
Where's Mamma?
Look, I've got something for you.
Come on, get it.
What are you doing, reading my mail?
Several letters there for your wife. Yesterday's, too.
I hope Lucy comes back looking as well as you do.
She's probably up at her Aunt Patsy's. She always goes there when she's lonely.
Thank you, Celeste, I'll take it up from here.
-Jerry. -What?
Supposing Aunt Patsy wasn't home?
I get it. I'm up to my neck in funny people!
Seriously, I wish Lucy would go out and get some fun now and again. Do her good.
That's the trouble with marriages today. People are always imagining things.
The road to Reno is paved with suspicions.
First thing you know, they're in a divorce court.
The broad-minded man from the Rio Grande!
If you think I'll get a chance to prove my broad-mindedness any minute, you're crazy.
Lucy's up at her Aunt Patsy's cabin. I'll bet on it.
Incidentally, what a swell spot that is. Good fishing....
Sometimes, on a clear day across that lake, you can see for....
Mrs. Barnsley, Miss Heath, Mr. Barnsley, Mr. Randall.
Aunt Patsy.
Any idea where Lucy is?
You know, she invited me to this--
-Darling! -Hello, dear!
How grand and brown you are!
Hello, Patsy, dear.
-Did you miss me?
Been thinking about me?
-Look what I brought you!
All the way from Florida?
Bless your heart!
You know Armand Duvalle, dear.
Come on in, Armand.
Mr. Duvalle, this is my aunt, Miss Adams.
Mr. and Mrs. Barnsley, Miss Heath and Mr. Randall.
We've had the most terrible time.
Armand's car broke down last night miles from nowhere... and we had to stay at the nastiest inn ever.
No modern conveniences. lt was dreadful! We were coming home from the junior prom. Armand's pupil invited us.
Oh, it's a long story, but I must....
Hello, there!
Your wife, she was the loveliest woman in the party.
Armand, you always say the nicest things.
Isn't that cute?
Did you bring him that?
-Yes-- -Go catch it!
-Were you disappointed I wasn't here?
-Not at all. After all, you didn't expect me.
And you'll forgive me for my car's imperfect performance?
Of course. I'm sorry the inn was so inconvenient.
That's the only thing that bothers me.
You know, your husband is not like the average American man.
He's free of all mean suspicion.
He has more the Continental mind. Yes?
That's right, I have a Continental mind. Will you have an eggnog?
Thank you.
I don't know what kind of a mind Jerry's got, Continental or cockeyed... but he's a wonder.
Now, if I stayed out all night... and waltzed in with handsome Mr. Duvalle, and said the car broke down.... lt did.
Why should Jerry be angry?
I didn't build the car.
-You're perfectly right, dear. -Of course I am.
Can't have a happy married life if you're always suspicious.
Right again.
-A little nutmeg?
-Please.
-Why am I boring you with private matters? -We're not bored.
No one's interested in my adventure but Jerry, who knows it's innocent... just as well as he knows that he just got back from Florida.
I see what you mean.
More drinks, everybody?
There's lots left.
-No, thank you, I think we better be going. -You don't all have to go, do you?
Go?
No.
-Well, it's silly to go so soon. -We must go, really.
Patsy, dear, where are you going?
I haven't even had a chance to talk to you.
I'll see you later, my dear.
I always say four's a crowd.
There's something in what she says.
Thank you.
-Say, are you hungry?
-To tell you the truth, I'm starved.
Why don't you go out and grab a bite?
-A strong fellow should take care of himself.
-Why, what have I done?
-lf you speak of last night, I assure you--
-You don't believe--
We'll discuss it in private.
That is if Mr. Duvalle can remember where we keep our door.
In all fairness, you should permit me to remain and explain ourselves.
American women aren't accustomed to gallantry.
I appreciate your offer, but maybe you'd better go.
Pardon me, Mrs. Warriner, you misunderstand.
I am a voice teacher, am I not?
For one year she has been my pupil. And from time to time, I pat her on the back.
I mean, I congratulate her on her...
-development. -ls that so?
-Do I express myself?
-You've been doing all right.
But now my position must be considered. I have never yet been in a scandal.
-Never been caught?
-No.
I am a great teacher, not a great lover.
That's right, Armand, no one could ever accuse you of being a great lover.
That is, I mean to say, who's to say whether you are or not?
It's all so silly! But maybe you had better go.
-l really don't know what to say. -lf you go, you won't have to say anything.
-Perhaps it is best this way, Mrs. Warriner. -l think so.
-l will see you soon? -Yes.
It has been all so perfect.
Thank you for everything.
Take another bow.
Not a bad performance considering no rehearsals or anything.
Why, Mr. Warriner, you're out of your Continental mind.
That was funny, what he said about your Continental mind.
-No doubt he has a better sense of humor. -No, I beg to differ.
Right now you're twice as funny as him.
-Quit stalling, Lucy. -l'm not--
Perhaps our marriage means nothing to you.
Perhaps you have no sentiment left for me. Look at this.
Look, a letter l wrote you. Did you care when you read it?
No!
You knew there'd be a letter every morning... but you were far too busy with Armand Duvalle to give it a thought.
It's enough to destroy one's faith, isn't it?
I haven't any faith left in anyone.
I know just how you feel.
What do you mean?
You didn't mention in any of your letters the terrible rainy spell in Florida.
The papers were full of it.
-l can explain that, Lucy. -You can?
Don't try to change the subject. You think a great offense is a great defense.
Don't try to justify your behavior by insinuating things about me.
I haven't any behavior to justify. I've just been unlucky.
You caught me in a truth, and it seems there's nothing less logical than the truth.
-A philosopher? -You don't believe me.
How can I believe you?
"The car broke down."
People stopped believing that ages ago.
-His car's very old. -So is his story.
-Let me tell you something. -Let me tell you something.
I told you the truth about all this, Jerry.
Don't you see? There can't be any doubt in marriage.
The whole thing's built on faith. If you've lost that, you've lost everything.
When that's gone the marriage is washed up.
-Do you mean that?
-Yes. -Then that settles it. -l guess it does.
I wouldn't go on living with you if you were dipped in platinum.
So divorce me. lt'll be a pleasure.
You think I'd drag that music lover to court to show people the man you preferred?
Then I'll divorce you. It's customary for the wife to bring suit.
It has something to do with the husband being a gentleman.
Just get on with the divorce proceedings. I can't wait.
-l'll call our lawyer right now. -All right, here.
You don't mind?
I don't know anyone else. You get around much more than I do.
is that so?
Hello?
Hello, Lucy.
What's that?
Divorce?
You and Jerry?
Don't do anything in haste you might regret later.
-Marriage is a beautiful thing, and you--
-Can't she call back after we've eaten?
Please be quiet, will you?
You seem agitated, Lucy. Try and calm yourself.
I'd hate to see you take any hasty action in a matter like this.
-Marriage is a beautiful thing, and you--
-Finish your meal.
-Why can't they call you back later?
-Will you shut your mouth?
As I was saying, Lucy, marriage is a beautiful thing.
When you've been married as long as I, you'll appreciate it, too.
Your food's getting ice-cold. You always complain about your food.
Just shut your big mouth. I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
If you don't like it, you know what you can do. So shut up!
Marriage is a beautiful thing.
You see? Because you were a naughty dog, they made you leave the room. Come on.
In the case of Warriner v. Warriner, the court grants... an interlocutory decree of divorce in favor of the plaintiff, Lucy Warriner.
The divorce, without further contesting, will become final 90 days from this day.
Plaintiff and defendant then have the liberty to make other marriages, if they so desire.
Your Honor, there's a matter still unsettled.
-The matter about.... -Mr. Smith.
-Yes, Your Honor, Mr. Smith. -Who is Mr. Smith?
-Mr. Smith is their dog. -No, Mr. Smith is my dog.
-ls that so?
-Silence!
But, you see, Mr. Smith belongs to me, and she has him.
Very well, go ahead.
The animal is in Mrs. Warriner's possession.
You ordered him from the courtroom at the beginning, for contempt.
-Mr. Warriner wishes to have him because....
-Because he's mine!
-He is not. -He is, too.
-He is not. -Silence!
is not.
Mrs. Warriner, step up and tell me why you regard the dog... as your personal property, so the court may decide if he should remain with you.
Nothing would please me more.
Your Honor, I saw Mr. Smith first.
It was in that pet shop on Madison Avenue. You know it?
-You don't? It's between 47th and....
-lt's frightfully immaterial.
Well, you ought to know.
I decided to buy Mr. Smith... but I turned away for a moment to look at a Persian kitten. Do you like cats?
I don't either. So I turned around again, and this man had Mr. Smith in his arms.
I said, "Pardon me, I'm buying this puppy." And then he just smiled at me.
Then somehow, suddenly, the three of us were having lunch... the man, and Mr. Smith, and I.
And then things happened swiftly... so I said, "We'd better get married," and we did.
That way we could give Mr. Smith a better home and live happily ever after.
-Until now. -l see.
In these custody cases, Mrs. Warriner... we often allow the final decision to rest with the party in question.
You mean Mr. Smith?
Send for the dog.
Custody of the dog will depend on his own desire.
-Mr. Warriner, will you step up here, please? -Yes, Your Honor.
Unfasten him.
You may each call the dog.
-Mr. Smith, come on, boy. -Smitty, look up here.
Don't pay attention. Come on, boy.
Look up here. You know me.
-Smitty, look up here. -No, don't!
I win.
Custody of the dog is awarded to Mrs. Warriner.
Your Honor, that's not quite fair. I ought to see the dog twice a month or so.
-l'll take it under advisement.
-Goodbye. Thank you. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Your Honor.
-You won't forget to do that, Judge?
-l'll take it under advisement.
Yes, but when will you know?
Look at that rain!
-Why, is it doing anything besides falling?
-l don't think so.
Nothing unusual ever happens around here.
Patsy, I'm sorry you're so bored tonight.
Why tonight? I've been bored for a month.
If I'd known we'd be buried side by side I'd never have taken this apartment.
I wouldn't have asked you to come and live with me if I'd known that... a sort of readjustment takes place after divorce.
Readjustment my foot! That's just another word for moping around.
Don't be silly. Anyhow, where can two women go alone?
You know dozens of men who'd turn handsprings to take you out.
I've got you all dressed up, ready to go out, and you weaken and refuse.
You're just an old grouch.
I want to go where there's life. And I don't mean plant life.
I want to go to the theater.
You know, go places later and step around and do things.
-But you can't go in all this rain.
-Why not, no taxis?
No escort.
Unless there's a new ruling, I don't need an escort to get a drink.
I'm going down to the bar and see Joe.
Bartender or no bartender, he's still a man.
-Maybe he knocks off early. -Patsy, you wouldn't!
I wouldn't?
You're talking to a desperate woman.
Hello, Smitty, come on up, boy.
-lsn't he cute?
-Too bad he can't wear a top hat.
Did you hear what she said?
-l wonder if you'd do me a favor? -Well, of course, that all depends.
Imagine you living right across the hall from us all of this time.
I think it's just wonderful that we've met this way.
Lucy, may I present Mr. Leeson?
This is my niece you wanted to meet. Her name is Lucy Warriner.
How do you do?
-Won't you sit down? -Thanks.
Mr. Leeson's just from Oklahoma, Lucy. He's a stranger in town.
He'd take it as real neighborly of us if we show him some of the bright spots.
He would?
It's raining awfully hard. I don't think--
That's just exactly what I said, "l don't think the rain will stop us."
Besides, I think it'll let up in a few minutes, Miss Warriner.
Mr. Leeson's a neighbor. He lives across the hall with his mother.
-That's what you said, right?
-Yes, with my mother.
We're here on a visit. I'm in oil, you know.
Marinated, so to speak.
Say, that's a good one! I got to remember to tell that to my mother.
Mr. Leeson, won't you tell us something about Oklahoma?
Oklahoma's pretty swell.
I got quite a ranch down there. Like you to see it sometime, Miss Warriner.
I don't get out there very....
l got cattle and horses and chickens and alfalfa and--
-Hello, Jerry. -Patsy, how are things?
-We weren't expecting you.
-Why, what goes on?
Hiya, fellow! Mr. Smith, how have you been?
I'll see you in a minute, boy.
Yeah, sure. -Hello, Jerry. -Hello, Lucy.
What might you be doing here?
Have you forgotten this is my day to visit Mr. Smith?
It says so right there.
I'm so sorry. Mr. Leeson, this is my husband.
He's only my husband for, how much longer is it now, 60 days?
-Fifty-nine. -That's better, only 59 days.
And don't worry about him, he has a Continental mind.
-Excuse me, what did you say?
-l'm glad to know you.
How can you be glad to know me?
I know how I'd feel if I was with a girl and her husband walked in.
I'll bet you do.
I don't think you ought to go around telling people you're not married.
He looks a nice fellow. How do you think he feels?
-Why don't you go play with the dog?
-You go on with whatever you were doing.
Don't mind me.
Any new dogs in the neighborhood?
Been chasing any cats?
Sit down, Mr. Leeson.
-Tell me some more about Arizona.
-Oklahoma. I mean Oklahoma. That's me for you!
is he getting enough to eat lately?
He doesn't look well.
You don't look so hot yourself.
I don't think he's getting enough exercise. He's got circles under his eyes.
-The court ruled--
-What about a tune, boy?
Yes. You see, there's nothing we can do about it.
Don't worry about it, Mr. Leeson. Go right ahead.
-My main business is oil.
Sing it!
I do pretty well.
I have a ranch. My hobby is horses.
Hobby horses!
Come on, let's get out of here.
-Goodbye, Jerry. -Goodbye, Warriner.
What's the matter?
-Are you sure you don't like that fellow?
-Like him! -You saw how I treated him, didn't you?
-That's what I mean.
On my ranch I got a little red rooster and a little brown hen... and they fight all the time, too.
But once in a while, they make up again, and they're right friendly.
-'Morning, Ma. -Well?
It was daylight when you came in.
I had a wonderful time. I met a girl--
That's what I thought. You keep your mind off women.
I can't, Ma.
You can't?
That's what your father always said.
Of course I like Dan Leeson. Why not?
He's sweet and thoughtful.
You should be the last one to object, you introduced him to me.
He was a man who could take us out. I didn't expect you to get silly about him.
There's nothing wrong in liking a man who's sane and considerate.
I was married to one who was insane and inconsiderate.
Your toast is burning.
-What's her name?
-Lucy Warriner.
Probably an alias.
You'll laugh for talking that way when you meet Lucy.
She won't want to meet me. She knows any woman could see through her.
Don't talk that way about Lucy. I'm crazy about her.
I believe she kind of likes me, too. I think I'm in love.
Do you know what rebound is?
Trying to get over one love by bouncing into love with somebody else.
It's fine, except the rebound is rarely the real thing. ln fact, it's the bunk.
There's the first bounce, the second, and....
Well, look at me.
You wind up like an old tennis ball.
I'm serious about Dan Leeson. I like him very much.
I'm all through with Jerry, he means nothing.
I don't love him, and I probably never did.
I'm sure I never loved him. Now I hate him. That surprises you, doesn't it?
I hate Jerry Warriner and I like Dan Leeson very much.
I hope he's crazy about me, because he's the finest man I've met.
I know, my toast is burning.
You're awful sweet and all that, but your mind's always on something else.
Or maybe someone else. ls it, sugar pie?
No, I'm in love with love.
"ln the spring, a young man's fancy lightly turns to"... what he's been thinking about all winter.
How long have you talked like Amos and Andy?
For quite some time.
I got wise to the fact that it helps me in my work.
So, as long as I work, you'll have to pardon my Southern accent.
Well, shut my mouth, who's that gorgeous-looking creature?
Have you heard that gag that's been flying around town?
"Who was that lady I saw you with?"
You mean, that's no lady, that's your wife?
I like this place best of all the spots I've been to.
-You do?
-Maybe it's because I'm so happy.
-Just think of it, Lucy. You'll be my wife. -Yes, I am thinking of it.
I've hoped for it ever since that first night I met you.
I can hardly wait for your final decree to come along.
It'll come along, Dan.
Incidentally, here's my husband coming along.
-Hello, folks. -Hello.
This is Dixie Belle Lee.
This is Mrs. Warriner, and Mr. Leeson, the gentleman Mrs. Warriner will marry.
-lt's mighty fine meeting you. -Now come along.
Now, you're sure we're not intruding?
-What do you mean?
-Wouldn't you like us to have a drink?
-Yes, of course. -Sit down.
My, isn't this cozy?
So, you two are going to be married.
I was glad to hear that. I said to myself, "That Leeson's just the man for Lucy."
-Then I said to myself-- -He's always talking to himself.
-lsn't this a charming place?
-Do you really like it?
I'm so glad. I almost feel like the place is mine.
-You come here often?
-l work here, didn't you know that?
No.
You're from the South, aren't you?
Well, now isn't he just the cleverest gent?
How'd y'all ever guess that?
I don't know, it was just a shot in the dark.
But Dixie Belle Lee isn't her real name.
-No?
-No, she changed it, you see... because her family objected to her going into show business.
My folks thought I was going to the dogs when I decided to go to work.
I'm sure you'll be a big success, and then they'll be proud of you.
Thank you. lt's real nice of you to say that. I'd better go now and get ready.
-Can you stay and see my act?
-We'll stay.
-Nothing could drag us away. -See you later, then.
-She seems like a nice girl.
-indeed. Enough about Dixie Belle for the moment. Let's talk about yourselves.
So you're going to live in Oklahoma, Lucy?
How I envy you. Ever since I was a small boy that name has been filled with magic for me.
Oklahoma.
We're going to live right in Oklahoma City.
Not Oklahoma City itself?
Lucy, you lucky girl.
No more running around the nightspots.
No more prowling around in New York shops.
I'll think of you whenever a show opens and say to myself:
"She's well out of it."
New York's all right for a visit, but I wouldn't want to live here.
I know I'll enjoy Oklahoma City.
Of course. lf it gets dull, you can always go to Tulsa for the weekend.
I think a big change like that does one good.
That's right.
I know this isn't quite the place, but Lucy tells me you two own a coal mine.
What about it?
Yes. Mr. Leeson thought that maybe he'd like to buy your interest.
That is, if the price is right.
I was telling Mr. Leeson, I mean Daniel... about how badly we were doing, and he thought maybe he could do better.
I suppose you told him there wasn't any coal in it, too.
Well, if you're interested, you might bring around the data tomorrow.
I'm very lucky.
You know what they call me back home?
I can guess.
I just met her.
I guess it was easier for her to change her name... than for a whole family to change theirs.
That'd go great out West.
Seemed to go pretty well with the cowboy here.
You want to change the subject?
Why don't you two get up and dance?
Or don't you dance?
Lucy doesn't care much about dancing.
Didn't you know that?
Did Lucy tell you that?
She's holding out on you. She's a beautiful dancer.
Why, I used to call her "Twinkle Toes." Hello, Twinkle Toes.
Have you been fooling me, you little rascal?
Honestly, I didn't think you cared much about it.
Care about it?
Why, I could dance till the cows come home.
I won several cups at it myself.
We never won any cups.
Maybe you had the wrong partner.
There's a lot in what you say.
-Can I have this waltz, Lucy?
Here, give this to the orchestra leader and tell him...
-to play the same number again.
Come on, sing.
It's "all day."
-l'm sorry. -lt's all right.
-Not bad. -Thanks.
-Never had a lesson in my life.
-You don't say. -Have you?
-Well, yes.
Let's sing another one. That must be him now.
-Hello, Warriner. -Hello, Leeson.
-Hello, Lucy. -Hello, Jerry.
-Glad you dropped up. -Thanks.
I really am very interested in that mine of yours.
Yes, I brought along all the records and history of....
l've looked all over for McCall's report on that mine.
-l can't find it anywhere. You must have it. -Maybe I have.
Next chance you get, look through your stocking drawer.
She always hides important things in the top drawer of her dresser.
She does?
Every legal paper we had smelled of sachet.
It did?
Even the marriage certificate.
Remember when the clerk asked to see it and you couldn't find it?
We had a bunch of pals at the hotel. They kept ribbing us all night.
Remember when they sent the bellboy?
We didn't want ice water.
No?
What's the matter?
When you two are married the three of us can talk more freely.
About this mine business... this place was formerly owned by the Fullerton Brothers.
You've heard of the Fullerton Brothers, haven't you?
Yes.
It seems they didn't know much about the mining situation in Pennsylvania.
-Their racket was mainly--
-Why, hello, Ma!
-Hello. -Hello, Mrs. Leeson.
-Hello, Lucy. -Ma, this is Mr. Jerry Warriner.
-Not-- -Yes, ma'am, that's right.
-We're discussing a business proposition. -l see.
-lt's funny seeing you. -lt is?
Well, it's funny seeing you.
What I mean is, I was at a tea this afternoon where some people... were speaking of you and of Lucy, too.
They knew you both before the divorce.
I'll bet you run into dozens of people who knew us before the divorce.
Yes, we used to get around quite a lot. Didn't we?
They spoke very well of you. They said you were a real gentleman.
Oh, did they really?
And they were talking of Lucy, too.
You know, you do sing divinely, dear.
But I'd never realized till this afternoon that you had a teacher... and a very handsome one, I understand.
There was a woman there, if I hadn't been a lady I would have slapped her face.
-Why didn't you?
-l wish I had, because she insinuated....
As a matter of fact, she didn't even insinuate.
Well, she was talking about your divorcing Mr. Warriner.
She came right out and said that it should have been....
No matter, no matter.
-No matter. -No matter.
Let's get down to business, Leeson.
If I'd had time to work this mine myself, I'd have made a fortune.
But I was always too busy making money for other people.
There's a section up there simply crying for someone to go in... who has the time and money to give it.
I think if you could sink a shaft in this north corner, right about here....
Wait, let me show you something.
I ought to tell you, Jerry, nobody is listening to you.
The girl's name needs clearing, partner.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
But I'm sure Mr. Warriner is pleased at the opportunity... to deny that silly story I heard this afternoon.
Why, certainly, Mrs. Leeson.
This woman said Mr. Warriner permitted you to bring proceedings so that....
Well, so that your reputation wouldn't be ruined.
There, it's out. i know it's silly but--
Of course it's silly, and so are you.
-What?
-See here, Warriner.
I mean it's silly for your mother to believe such nonsense.
You see, our divorce was one of those tragedies that you read about in the papers.
A trusting woman and a worthless man.
I was never good enough for Lucy and finally she found it out. I was never good enough for Lucy and finally she found it out.
Lucy is above suspicion, and always has been.
She's as pure as the driven snow, as faithful as she is fair.
And I would that I had been worthy to kiss the hem of her garment.
Never during our marital bliss did she cause me a moment's uneasiness.
Never did I have to ask, "Lucy, where have you been, what were you doing?"
I always knew.
I tell you, something wonderful went out of my life when I lost her.
-l know just how you feel. -How do you know?
How can you know how it feels to have used up the best years of a woman's life?
Of course, that's the way it goes.
Excuse me, you're sitting on my prospectus.
Dan, take those and look them over.
And let me know.
And, Dan... take good care of her.
I'll be going now.
Yes, Dan, take good care of her.
Maybe you'll succeed where l failed.
I'm sure that the three of you will be very happy out where the West begins.
If you ever think of me, send me a postcard.
Just say, "Having a wonderful time." l'll understand.
Goodbye, now.
Ma, are you convinced about everything?
What about the music teacher?
You two try and settle things for yourselves. Let me know how it comes out.
Put a light in the window if it's yes, two if it's no.
And if you can't make up your minds, just pull down the shade.
Hello.
What are you doing in my apartment, if I'm not too inquisitive?
I thought after my swell reference about you, I deserved a drink.
-Wish I'd mixed it for you. -l see what you mean.
Certainly do appreciate all the charming things you said about me.
When I get the chance, I hope I can do as much for you.
It was nothing at all.
I try to go through life-- l know, spreading a little sunshine as you go.
No, frankly, I was worried about you.
You've never asked for money. Do you need any?
No, I think I can struggle along without any help from you.
I thought maybe you made a bad investment.
-No. I only made one bad investment. -Don't bite me.
I thought that maybe Buffalo Bill's millions might have something to do--
Nothing to do with anything.
Millions or no millions, he's a very charming person.
I've seen him.
I can't possibly interpret this as jealousy.
No.
I've come out from behind those clouds.
I've taken a definite turn for the better.
Nothing's going to hurt me anymore.
That's too bad, Jerry.
-Did it hurt you much?
-Just the one hand?
-Just the one hand.
I'll be going. I always like to leave people laughing.
is there anything I can get you for it?
No, I'm a stout fellow, I'll carry on.
-Where's Mr. Smith?
-Out with Aunt Patsy.
Tell me something before I go, will you?
-What do you see in this fellow?
-None of your business.
Not that I care, but what kind of a line could he have that would impress you?
You might be surprised. You could take a few lessons and profit nicely.
You'd be surprised what I'd give to get an earful of that.
-You would. -l couldn't wait to see you.
I had to tell you how awful l feel about what happened.
You'll have to forgive Ma. She's kind of old-fashioned.
-l'll forgive her. -You won't hold it against her?
No. Now you go and dress for dinner. We'll be very late.
I'm a lot quicker than you are.
Just to prove that you're not mad, will you give me a little kiss?
-Right here in the hall?
Don't be silly. -There's nobody around.
-You never can tell if someone's around. -l'll come in.
Don't come in. We'll be awfully late.
-Don't be bashful. -l'm not bashful.
I've never kissed you before. And I don't think this is exactly the place.
If you knew how crazy l am about you, you wouldn't hesitate. I can't sleep nights.
-Try drinking some hot milk. -l must be in love...
-because I started writing poetry to you. -Poetry.
I was going to surprise you with it at dinner, but it's short. lt goes like this:
"To you, my little prairie flower l'm thinking of you every hour
"Though now you're just a friend to me I wonder what the end will be"
Excuse me, Dan, I do laugh at the oddest times.
You see what I mean?
"Oh, you would make my life divine
"if you would change your name to mine"
That's really....
That's beautiful, Dan. It's really beautiful. There's my phone.
You've got to go now, really.
-Hello. -Comment ça va, madame?
-You haven't forgotten about tomorrow? -Look, I have company.
All right, wait a minute, hold the phone.
There, now go on, Dan, I'll see you later.
Lucy, you've made me the happiest man in the world.
Dreamed of this moment for days, now it's all come true.
Dan, really!
I'll go home now and dress for dinner. I'm so happy I could eat three steaks.
Hello?
Telephone.
Hello?
Can I expect you tomorrow?
At 3:00 tomorrow afternoon? I think that would be convenient.
Very well then, 3:00 tomorrow afternoon. Goodbye.
-Who was that?
-Why should it interest you?
Wait a minute, after all, the final decree isn't in yet.
-lf you must know, it was my masseuse. -My who?
I've heard everything. I'm going out to get some popcorn and pink lemonade.
I've just seen a three-ring circus.
Armand Duvalle in?
-Please, your name?
-Jerry Warriner. ls my wife here?
I do not know.
What do you mean you don't know?
-l only know I don't know. -You wouldn't mind if I look around.
Me, jujitsu.
-Me, jujitsu. -ls that so?
Me, jujitsu, too.
You must not go in. You must not disturb him.
I can't go in, he must not be disturbed.
You should have seen your master this afternoon.
Come on, sit up, boy.
No, better still, I tell you... go hide your eyes and I'll give it to you that way.
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five. No peeking.
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five. You ready?
All right, then, come on.
You're too smart.
Honestly, Patsy, you should have seen Jerry this afternoon.
And when that chair started to slip from under him.
-l will say that for Jerry, he's never dull. -He was so silly, though.
I know he thought he'd find me in Armand's arms.
He must have been terribly disappointed.
He must have felt awful about not finding you two in a clinch.
Jerry's always had the most fantastic way of getting into scrapes.
We've had some grand laughs together.
But a girl really wants dependability and security.
Yes, I suppose she does.
Then she ought to buy an annuity. Be more fun than Leeson.
Don't explain. I'm not marrying him.
That's what I wanted to tell you. I'm not either.
I can't marry him because I'm still in love with that crazy lunatic.
And there's nothing I can do about it.
Patsy, here and there, now and then...
-l've done a few things for you, haven't I?
-Yes.
Here's a note that I've written to Dan explaining exactly why I can't marry him.
I could never phrase anything in person as beautifully as I have in this note.
But now I've lost my nerve about giving it to him.
-Could you sort of see that he gets it?
-l should say so.
Well, I tried to forget Jerry.
I know.
That's why you jumped at Leeson as if he were the last man on earth.
I'll answer that.
Every time I open the door somebody walks in.
-How do you do? -How do you do?
-Hello, Armand. -You sent for me, madam.
Yes, I've been so embarrassed about what happened... in front of your guests I couldn't get out of there soon enough.
Your husband is a very funny man, isn't he?
I'm convinced he must care about me or he wouldn't do those funny things.
Yes, but he doesn't care much about me.
No, Armand, that's just what I'm getting at.
-l'm wondering, could you do me a favor? -But of course.
I've been thinking... I wonder if you could convince him... that everything was just as I said it was that night at the inn.
I'd be glad to.
But does he carry a gun?
You're not afraid of him?
-Of course not, but--
-Will you do it for me?
As soon as possible?
Yes.
And, by all means, he mustn't know that I had anything to do with it.
-No. -As soon as possible.
Mr. Smith!
How are you?
-But this is much too soon. -lsn't it?
-Much too soon. -What can I do?
-You can't keep standing here. -l know, but where can I go?
-Look, out here. -No.
Look, in the bedroom. Hurry up.
-Hiya, fellow. -Hello, Jerry.
-Hello, Patsy. How have you been?
-Fine.
You knew it was me, didn't you? Sure you did.
You remembered me, didn't you? Sure, you bet.
Get away.
-Hello, Jerry. -Hello, Lucy.
-l suppose you know why I dropped in. -No, I don't exactly.
As a matter of fact, I came to apologize for my behavior today in Duvalle's apartment...
-studio, or whatever he calls his joint. -Oh, that?
I certainly acted like a prize lunatic, and I'm sorry.
-lt was nothing at all. -Nothing?
Nothing except the most ridiculous and sickening exhibition... mortal man ever made of himself.
I don't know why I act like that.
Unless it's because of the effect that Duvalle has on me.
I never knew anyone that can aggravate me the way he does.
-l can't think about him without seeing red. -You shouldn't get so excited.
A mere mention of his name and I feel positively murderous.
You do?
-What's the matter with you?
-Nothing.
I was just thinking about your problem. You certainly have a problem.
I know I have a problem, and I know how I feel, too.
I guess there's nothing I can do about it.
Look at Mr. Smith.
-l guess he wants to play. -Yes.
Here, you go and hide it for him.
No fair peeking, Smitty.
All right, let's go. Come on.
Oh, no, you're cold.
You're colder than ice. Cold, cold.
Oh, boy, what's wrong with you?
Nice going, fellow. Let it go. Good boy.
Well, Lucy... the main idea is, do you accept my apology?
Besides making a blue-ribbon sap of myself today, I must have embarrassed you terribly.
You took it fine, though.
-You must admit you were--
-Yes.
-What was that? -Nothing, just an old mirror.
-The boy's getting worse every day. -Mr. Smith, that's a fine thing.
I'm surprised at you. Trying to get rid of me?
No, he wasn't trying to get rid of you, you know it.
Well, I really hadn't planned to leave so soon.
I thought, if you have nothing to do, you might like to go for a drive with me.
Well, the air will do you good, and we can talk things over?
-l'd love that. Yes, it would do me good. -Swell.
-Where's your car?
-Downstairs, in the garage.
While I'm changing, you get the car and I'll meet you out front.
-Okay, dear. -l won't be a minute.
That's funny, I only bought the hat an hour ago and look at it.
Did you have a haircut, maybe?
-No. -No?
Maybe you have it on backwards. Put it on the other way around.
Well, I hadn't thought of that. Wait a minute.
Yes, there, now that's more becoming.
It is a bit roomy. Maybe they're wearing them that way this year.
Well, I'm not.
Looks mighty funny to me.
Look at your ears. That's why. Your ears are all down.
What's wrong with it?
-Stick your ears up underneath. -Don't be silly.
How can you stick your ears up?
That's no good.
Well, I always put my ears in.
-Who's there?
-Me, and my ma.
Lucy, I've caused you enough trouble for one day.
He better not find me here. I'll duck in the other room.
No, no, but....
Could you....
-Hello, there. -Hello, Aunt Patsy.
Good evening, Mrs. Leeson. Good evening, Mrs. Leeson.
Lucy, you didn't come over this morning the way you usually do.
-l was so busy this morning. -That's what I kept telling you, Ma.
-Do you mind if I sit down?
-No, not at all.
-l've got an awful headache. -Well, I'm getting one.
I thought maybe you were angry at my repeating what that awful....
Nonsense, Mrs. Leeson.
-What on earth was that?
-Somebody's cleaning up in there.
I was afraid....
-Must they do that?
-Yes-- I was afraid, but I knew that in your heart you knew... that I never suspected you.
Of course not, Mrs. Leeson.
The first time Dan talked about you, I said, "Why, she sounds like a sweet little thing."
Why, to know Lucy is to love her.
Lucy, I got a surprise for you. Ma and I talked it all over.
I hope you are going to like Oklahoma, because I'm going to ask you....
Excuse me.
They forgot to touch second.
Come on, Dan.
Well, I guess a man's best friend is his mother.
I certainly learned about women from you.
-Here's your diploma. -Come on.
What's the matter with you, Smitty?
I see what you mean. Patsy, look at this.
Oh, yes, that's Barbara Vance.
-You know who she is, don't you? -Yes, I know who she is.
The madcap heiress. lsn't that what the papers usually call her?
Millions of dollars and no sense. I wonder what she's doing with Jerry.
Entertaining him, running around town with him... and I imagine falling in love with him.
-You can't tell all that from this picture. -No.
But I can tell it from what I've heard. If rumor is true, Barbara is quite a girl.
And Jerry's having a lot of fun.
Come in.
Hello, Jerry.
Hello, Lucy, what's the nature of this visit?
Well, I just thought I'd....
-Do you know what today is?
-Certainly.
Our divorce becomes final today. Tomorrow, we'll both be back in circulation.
I just thought I'd drop up and wish you a lot of luck.
That's very nice of you. Would you like to join me for some wine?
Of course I would.
That was a cute picture of you and Barbara in the morning paper.
I love the caption: "Off with the old love."
I thought "Out of the frying pan" might have been better.
is that so?
Well, I think that Barbara and I will be very happy together.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
Only I don't think you'll be as happy as Daniel and I.
What?
-ls that still on? -What do you mean, "ls that still on?"
After that two-men-in-a-bedroom farce... I sort of imagined that when we left, he left.
Oh, no. I just explained things to him very simply.
Oh, did you?
Did you say our cars broke down... and we had to stay at your place because of the taxi strike?
No, I didn't tell him that. I told him the truth.
And, strangely enough, he believed me.
Yes, it was very refreshing.
Well, what shall we drink to?
Let's drink to our future.
Here's hoping you and Barbara will be very happy... which I doubt very much.
Let's drink to your happiness with Buffalo Bill...
-Good. -...which doesn't even make sense.
-l'll tell you. We'll drink to the two of us. -Good.
As we go down life's highway... you going your way... and I going my way.
-Okay?
-All right.
It's flat.
I'll open another bottle.
You'll have to hurry it up though because I'm meeting Daniel.
I think champagne is so fitting to round out our romance.
I remember the first drink we ever had together.
You, in your very best manner, said:
"lt must be champagne."
And then you offered a toast, you remember?
-No, I don't. -Well, being a woman, I do.
You said....
This'll land you a laugh.
You said:
"Lend an ear, I implore you
"This comes from my heart I'll always adore you
"Till death do us part"
Remember?
It was pretty swell.
I mean, while it lasted.
All beautiful things must end... so I guess we may as well call it a day.
If you don't mind, I'll call a car.
Would you call a car for me? Right away, please.
Hello?
Who's this, may I ask?
It's what's-her-name. I only said hello. Maybe you can pick it up from there.
-Did you have to answer my phone?
-l thought it was about the car. I'm sorry.
What am I going to tell her?
You can think of something. You always could.
-l haven't time to think of anything. -Tell her you'll call her back.
-How can I tell her I'll call her back?
-Then tell her to call you back.
Hello? Hello, darling.
Well, it took you long enough. Have you decided who the woman is?
Isn't that funny, I knew you were going to ask me that.
-So did I. -Quiet.
It's very simple, dear. lt's my sister.
Your sister?
How are you going to get out of that?
She just got back from Paris, dropped in to see me.
Jerry, you're slipping.
I'd love to meet your sister. Why don't you bring her along tonight?
She can't come this evening. She has a previous engagement.
She wants me to come over?
Naturally she's anxious to meet you, too, but....
Yes, tell her I'd love to meet her. Tell her to wear boxing gloves.
She said she'll break her engagement and come over later.
-But I strongly doubt that.... -Yes, I doubt it.
Dear, I'll do my best to fix it up so the two of you meet very soon. -Yes.
Goodbye. -That'd be lovely.
I'm in a fine fix. She wants to meet my sister.
-You're a big help. -You know me. Anything I can do....
-What?
To break it up?
-l see what you mean.
I'm in a fine mess.
Yes, hello?
I did it again.
What does she do?
Call every five minutes?
-You shouldn't take that from anybody. -Hello, Barbara.
Put your foot down....
-l told you she couldn't make it this evening. -She can't get away with it.
There's no reason to call me every five minutes about it, is there?
No. Well, all right.
-Good evening, Mr. Warriner. -Good evening.
-Hello, Barbara. -Hello.
Good evening, Mrs. Vance.
-Hello, Mr. Vance. -Jerry.
Where's your sister?
She was terribly sorry she couldn't be here tonight.
She didn't weather the boat trip well. When I left, she was calling the doctor.
You can imagine my surprise when a woman answered the phone.
You can't blame me for being suspicious.
Barbara, you can't have a happy married life if you're always suspicious.
There can't be doubts in marriage.
Marriage is based on faith. If you lose that, you've lost everything.
Very well said, Jerry.
Yes, wasn't it? I think I read it in a book or something.
I was just thinking, will your sister be here for the wedding?
-l doubt that very much, Mrs. Vance. -Maybe I should ask her to be a bridesmaid.
I think she's sailing back to Paris almost immediately.
She said she'll try to see you before she goes.
You'd like my sister. She's your type.
-Where did she go to school?
-Excuse me?
-l said, where did she go to school?
-ln Switzerland.
-You say your father was a Princeton man?
-That's right, sir. Class of '92.
He tells some funny stories about the place in those days.
He tells one in particular about a football game.
It seems Yale was playing Princeton one day... and with the ball on Princeton's two yard line, Yale fumbled.
A minute to go, Dad picked up the ball, and ran....
Miss Lola Warriner.
Hello, brother dear. I made it.
What did you say, dear?
-l just asked how you were feeling. -l'm feeling fine. And you?
Mrs. Vance, may I present my sister, Lola.
How do you do?
-lt's lovely to know you. -Thank you.
-Won't you come in?
-Thank you.
-Barbara, this is Lola. -How do you do?
It's nice to be able to meet you.
I've seen your pictures, and wondered how you look.
-l wondered about you, too. -Well, thank you.
-Lola?
-Yes, dear?
This is Barbara's father, Mr. Vance.
-Mr. Vance, my sister. -How do you do?
What's the matter?
Nothing, only I never would have known you from his description.
-Won't you sit down? -Thank you.
Did I interrupt something? Weren't you talking when I came in for....
Would you excuse me, Mrs. Vance? My handkerchief.
Thank you.
It's me. lsn't that silly?
It's you this time, Mrs. Vance.
Look, I'll just put it over here, and get it out of the way.
Dear!
I guess that could go on and on and on.
I hope not.
Go on with your story, honey.
Yes, I was telling a story about my, about our father.
Oh, you were?
I don't want to be rude, but may I have a drink?
I had three or four before I came, but they're wearing off, you know how that is.
Don't look at me like that. You like a little drink yourself.
We call him Jerry the Nipper.
Likes to sneak it when nobody's looking. So cute about it, too.
I've seen him go an evening, apparently having nothing to drink... and all of a sudden, fall flat on his puss.
A glass of sherry, perhaps?
Will you get Miss Warriner a glass of sherry?
A glass of sherry?
Excuse me.
I don't like sherry.
-Would you make that ginger ale please?
-Ginger ale?
I'm sorry to interrupt you again, Jerry. Now, what were you saying?
I was just telling one of Father's stories. You've heard it.
With a minute to go, Dad had the ball--
-A ball?
What ball?
-The football.
What in the world was Dad ever doing with a football?
I was just telling a story about when Father was at Princeton. You remember--
Oh, yes, of course I remember. Pop loved Princeton.
He was there nearly 20 years.
If ever a man loved a place, he did. He just adored it.
And he certainly kept it looking beautiful.
You've seen the grounds, of course.
Of course?
-Thank you. -l'm afraid I'm--
So sorry!
-Here's your handkerchief. -Thank you.
I'm afraid that my sister has a somewhat distorted sense of humor.
So have I.
What she meant was, Father presented the college... with some of its finest landscapings.
Excuse me. Was I thirsty! It must have been that ham I had for dinner.
-l think my brother's pretty swell, don't you?
-Oh, yes.
He's always been pretty swell to me.
I was working my head off at the Virginia Club.
But the minute he started doing better, you know what I mean... why, he made me give up my job and take a trip to London and Paris... and....
I think that was pretty swell, don't you?
What did you do at the Virginia Club?
-You see-- -l'll tell her!
It was a little act, kind of....
Well, it's a little hard to explain.
-Have you got any records?
-Records?
-Yes. We have some records. -Well, maybe if we....
Say, wait a minute!
Don't anybody leave this room. I've lost my purse.
-Why, here it is. -Well, am I relieved.
Where are the records?
Come this way and I'll show you.
Look, will you keep an eye on that for me?
Here's my song. Would you like to have me do it for you?
-Well, no, I don't--
-Okay.
You'll have to put that on. It's a little fancy for me.
The one we've got at home, you just wind.
I wouldn't, if I were you.
I won't do it the way I did at the club... if that's what you're afraid of.
You think I'm a fool?
The number has some wind effects... but you'll just have to use your own imagination about them.
Get it?
I never could do that.
Are we going so soon?
I was just beginning to enjoy myself.
Good night. Good night, all.
-Where are you going?
-l'm going to Patsy's cabin.
-You're not in any condition to drive. -l can make it in two minutes on two wheels.
That's what you think.
-Get over. -This is my car. I want to drive my car.
-Over. -No.
-l wish you'd stayed in there. -That's right.
Would you mind shutting that off, or at least turning it down?
Give it to me.
That's right, put it where we can find it.
-Here, you can't do that. -What?
-Shut that thing off. -What?
It's against the law. Besides, you'll wake everyone up.
What?
He says we'll wake up....
Why don't you help me?
-lt's beautiful up here, don't you think so?
-Sure, it's swell.
If it wasn't for you, I'd have missed all this.
That's right.
I suppose by the time I get to town... it will hardly be worthwhile going to bed.
You mind if I use your car to go home?
No, I don't mind, only I think it's awfully silly.
Patsy will be disappointed.
Well, thanks. I'll go home.
It's all right with me. My goodness, I just thought....
Yes, you just thought that if I'd stay up there... you'd show me exactly how innocent a night in the country can be, didn't you?
Are you still harping on that same old string?
It doesn't matter to me whether you go or stay.
I was just trying to make it easier for you, that's all.
Did you have to throw that gadget away?
You want me to go back and look for it?
What else can happen to us?
A lot.
-What's that?
-Two motorcycles.
-Anybody riding them?
-There are two men.
-Are they in uniform?
-Yes.
Fine.
-Turn down that radio. -l can't.
What do you mean you can't?
You lost the control?
You can't let it run that way!
-Let me take a look at it. -Wait a minute, I'll get out of your way.
See what you can do.
-Help me to sort the wiring. -Let's take a look at it.
Don't!
It's always good.
Do you know you can get a ticket for that?
-ls this your car?
-Nope!
-Whose car is it?
-l'll give you one more guess.
So it's yours. Where's your ownership card?
-ln my bureau's upper right-hand drawer. -Are you sure this is your car?
Of course I'm sure!
If it's your car, what's the license number?
What is it?
I don't know. They change it every year.
Don't look now, but what's the number on your motorcycle?
-Have you folks been drinking?
-No, I haven't, but....
-Let me see you walk this line. -Come on.
Go on, honey, truck it!
-Now what have you done?
-The brakes are bad.
It's a bad break for us, too. Now we haven't any transportation.
Could you two gentlemen take us to my aunt's cabin?
It's only 15 miles.
-That is, if you've nothing else to do. -No, I don't.
-Have you?
-Oh, no.
Oh, that's fine.
Where will you sit?
I'll have to figure that one out, I guess.
Come on, try it. lt's fun!
Now, listen, you two. Don't say a word to this guy.
Who are these people?
Why, that's Mrs. Warriner and that's Mr. Warriner.
How do you do?
Hello.
I guess that settles it. Will you get my car out in the morning?
In the meantime, think of something you'd like for Christmas. Goodbye.
-l hope you have a nice trip back. -Thank you.
Hi, Dad.
Hello, Dad.
Everything all right with you?
-Oh, I'm feeling fine. -That's good.
But I wasn't expecting nobody tonight.
Isn't Aunt Patsy here?
-Well, no. -She isn't here?
-But I thought for sure she was here. -l didn't.
Isn't that funny?
Let me get you some coffee.
Oh, no, I don't think so, Dad.
It might keep me awake. I'm going right to bed. I'm awfully tired.
See? She's all in.
-Oh, Dad, is this room in order?
-Yes.
That's fine. Mr. Warriner will sleep in there.
Give him a couple of nice warm blankets. He has a bad cold.
is that right?
I've had a bad cold now for some considerable time.
-That's too bad. -About three months.
How are you doing in there? How are you doing in there?
I'm having a little wardrobe trouble.
You should see me.
I'm glad you told him I have a cold. He fixed me up good.
My nightie is coming to me through the courtesy of Aunt Patsy.
Go, get off!
Air-conditioned.
-What's wrong with this?
-l don't know.
The lock isn't very practical, is it?
No, it's not so very practical....
l guess it will serve its purpose.
Well, good night.
Good night.
I'm afraid we're going to have trouble with this.
I guess I'll be all right.
-Good night. -Good night.
Good night.
I told you we'd have trouble with this.
Yes.
In a half an hour, we'll no longer be Mr. and Mrs.
Funny, isn't it?
Yes, it's funny that everything is the way it is, on account of how you feel.
I mean, if you didn't feel how you do, things wouldn't be as they are, would they?
I mean, things could be the same if things were different.
-But things are the way you made them. -Oh, no.
Things are the way you think I made them. I didn't make them that way at all.
Things are just the same as they always were... only you're the same as you were, too... so I guess things will never be the same again.
Good night.
-Got caught in the door. -Good night.
Good night.
Why, you....
Well, there it goes again.
You're all confused, aren't you?
-Aren't you?
-No.
You're wrong about things being different... because they're not the same.
Things are different, except in a different way.
You're still the same, only I've been a fool.
But I'm not now.
As long as I'm different, don't you think... maybe things could be the same again... only a little different?
You mean that, Jerry?
Are you sure?
No more doubts? No more being....
-Except....
-Except what?
-There's only one thing that bothers me. -What?
This darn lock.
is that all?
You think maybe if you....
Good night.
Are you going to Epernay?
- When?
- In a half hour.
By lorry?
Then give me a lift.
- Right.
Josephine?
- Yup!
- You've no monopoly!
Maréchal, you've got to take up a staff officer.
He's picked a rotten time.
- Josephine again?
- Yup!
Where will that get you?
She'll have to wait, that's all.
Alcohol kills!
Alcohol drives you mad! The squadron leader drinks it!
This is Captain de Boeldieu of Divisional Command.
Have you seen this photo, Mr Maréchal?
Ricord and I took it.
And where is this... Mr Ricord?
- On leave.
- Of course.
That little grey spot worries me...
There, below the road.
- That's a canal, not a road.
- No, a railway.
Such unanimity is a tribute to our photography.
It was misty.
Still, I'd like to clear up the mystery.
I'll order a plane.
I'll go and get ready, Sir.
Flying suit or jacket?
I don't mind, one smells, the other moults.
The fighter squadron, please.
Drive fast to the sugar refinery.
I shot down a French plane.
If the crew are officers, invite them here for lunch.
Make us one of your famous fruit punches.
To celebrate my shooting down my second plane.
No careless talk!
The enemy is listening
Two officers, one wounded, so I took him to the first-aid post.
Captain von Rauffenstein, 21 Squadron.
- Captain de Boeldieu, Staff HQ.
- Pleased to meet you.
Lieutenant Maréchal, pilot.
Sorry about your arm.
My officers.
I am honored to have French guests.
Now, gentlemen, let us dine.
I knew a Boeldieu in Berlin,
Count de Boeldieu.
My cousin, Edmond de Boeldieu.
He was Military Attaché.
He is a pilot now...
Not hungry?
I can't cut up the meat.
- May I?
- Thank you.
You speak good French.
I worked as an engineer in Lyons.
Really! I'm in eng... engineering...
To Captain de Crussol, French Air Force, shot down in flames
From the German officers of 21 Squadron
I regret this coincidence.
May the earth lie gently on our gallant enemy.
I have come for the prisoners.
PRISONER-OF-WAR CAMP NÂ° 17 OFFICERS CAMP
Officers will be treated with the consideration due to their rank.
However, you are reminded that you are under German military law.
You will therefore submit to German discipline.
Every German soldier in the camp may give you orders.
And you will obey without protest.
You will salute German officers.
At any attempt at escape, sentries have orders to fire on officers outside the camp boundary.
Incorrect dress is not permitted.
Strictly forbidden!
It is forbidden to form groups or insult the German nation... to write or speak to civilians...
Strictly forbidden!
It is forbidden to speak to sentries.
Come with us to attend to some formalities.
Russian names decline, like in Latin.
- Newcomers.
- Better warn them.
Pure angel, radiant angel
Hide your gold!
Get into your rooms!
- What did they say?
- To hide our valuables.
Leave it alone, it's mine.
I've nothing on me.
I'd no idea I was coming. Sorry.
Where are your manners?
Sorry, it's our duty, this is war.
Agreed, but even so let's remember our manners.
Otherwise I shall consult the Commanding Officer.
How are you doing, pal? Not bad at all, eh?
Here, Muller.
You'll take some chocolate, won't you?
You've no right to open my ham!
It's regulations!
It's bad! You can have it!
He's too finicky!
I'm delighted each time my parents send me a parcel.
Here we are, in the heart of Germany, miles behind the front...
And a tin of peas arrives from Paris. - All right, then? - Fine.
What astonishes me is their honesty in handing over the parcels.
It's a fact.
Feldwebel Arthur stuffs himself with cabbage every day.
Gives him chronic indigestion.
He'd much rather tuck in to your peas.
Don't kid yourselves.
They wouldn't risk the parcels stopping.
They're hard put to feed themselves.
Hurry up, our guests will be hungry.
Same old thing! Old boots again!
What are the French eating?
Cabbages, but they've their parcels.
- Russians?
- Cabbage roots, but no parcels.
- The English?
- Plum pudding.
In peace-time I was an actor... in the Halls.
- Ever see me?
- The theatre's too serious for me.
I prefer cycle racing.
You ever follow it?
You must have heard of the champions.
Can we buy what we like?
Yes, through the canteen.
Fine, I shall buy an armchair... playing cards, books, English cigarettes...
You won't find those!
I'll try and come tomorrow, Sir.
Gentlemen, dinner is served.
What shall we begin with?
Cold chicken, pÃ¢té de foie... mackerel in wine?
Quite a menu!
Don't they feed us?
They do in theory, in fact it's uneatable.
Fortunately there are our parcels, especially Rosenthal's.
Please...
A drop of cognac as an aperitif?
Why not?
I've never eaten so well in my life!
- Some fish?
- Yes, please.
I'm starting to take Rosenthal's kindness for granted.
It shows man is a creature of habit.
No need to tell you he's a teacher.
Teach... preach... Screech...
leech...
Bloody hell!
Quite a joker!
Are we supposed to find that witty?
He's particular!
This calls for a drink!
Good cognac.
From Fouquet's, disguised as a mouthwash.
Fouquet's?
It's a bar on the Champs-Elysées.
In Paris, I ate at my brother-in-law's.
It's less expensive.
- Been in Paris lately?
- A week ago.
Lucky chap! Many people there?
Maxim's was crowded.
I never go to places like that...
I prefer a quiet spot...
with good wine.
- Maxim's... never been there.
- You're not missing much.
We know you eat at your brother-in-law's.
- Hey!
- What is it?
Is he there... the monocle?
I've just come from the canteen.
About his armchair...
Nothing doing.
I'll tell him.
Nice chap, the one with the parcels.
Well-off, too.
- You bet!
- You know the Rosenthal bankers?
That's his family.
Am I tickling?
What's he do?
He's a dress designer.
Funny idea.
If I'd all that money...
What did you do in civvy street?
Engineer, Ordnance Survey.
Between ourselves...
Can your pal, the Captain, be trusted?
He may seem odd, but he's a decent chap.
You can trust him all right.
- Fine, then.
- Why?
You see... we're digging a tunnel.
What for?
To escape.
What do you dig with?
With a coal shovel, old cans...
We should come up in a garden... behind those buildings...
It's open country.
Slow work.
We've been at it for two months.
We only need a few more weeks.
The war'll be over first!
That's an illusion.
Think so?
Best to be prepared.
Where's the tunnel?
You'll see tonight, after roll-call.
So you're digging a hole... like Monte Cristo, what a laugh!
Thanks for your help.
Well, you can't do it with your arm.
I'd like to ask you something.
What's the Ordnance Survey?
- Maréchal!
- Present!
- Boeldieu!
- Captain de Boeldieu, please.
Present!
I want my present!
- Whose turn is it?
- Cartier.
Mine!
What's that?
It's to help breathe, needs lengthening.
And those bags?
They're to collect the earth. And this?
This is the alarm.
If I'm suffocating...
I pull the string...
The tin falls... the others pull me out by the legs.
What are you waiting for?
Now for my mole act!
A mole in a hole!
Is the tunnel safe?
It's shored up with wooden props.
And the earth?
We've been stuffing it under the floor, but there's no more room.
So we fill bags and empty them outside.
Hear that?
I'm sure I heard something.
Nothing.
And again...
We'll send someone out to reconnoitre.
You slip out and take a look around.
I'll pretend to go to the lavatory.
What happened, Mr Arthur?
He tried to escape.
He was caught in the gardens behind those buildings... and shot.
Out there?
- Is he dead?
- I think so.
- Anyway, what are you doing out?
Going to the lavatory.
- What was it?
- Someone tried to escape.
He got as far as the gardens behind the buildings.
A sentry shot at him.
He's dead.
Look, the alarm...
- No answer. - Let's pull him out.
Are you hurt?
Drink some cognac.
From Fouquet's.
Cheers... don't take it away!
Whose turn is it tomorrow?
Yours, Sir... if you don't mind.
With pleasure, I need some exercise.
It is strictly forbidden to appear in anything except military uniform...
Good news?
My aunt writes from Bordeaux that they're crowded out.
What do you think?
They'd better watch out, it says here there's a big Boche push.
There haven't been any celebrations so it can't mean much.
Coming gardening?
If you like.
German bulletins are so exaggerated.
So are ours.
Remember the Russian steam-roller?
Don't you think it's time we got down to... serious work?
But not all together.
Give me your tools.
And General Winter, who'd kill off the wicked Boche but act as a tonic for the Allies.
And "turpinite", remember "turpinite"?
A container as big as a...
a radish... could blow up an army.
Why, they'd tried it on flocks of sheep.
Pity they didn't stop at that!
What've you planted here?
Dandelions.
I dream of dandelion salad.
The war'll be over before your dandelions sprout. Don't be so sure.
This curious exercise will give us laborerâ€™s hands.
The hampers have come!
- The costumes?
- They're at the theatre.
One is full of women's clothes!
Coming, Sir?
No, I've no talent for theatricals.
Besides, I'm busy.
- A game of patience?
- Exactly.
I'm a realist.
Well, Arthur, found anything?
Nothing...
Well, gentlemen, enjoy yourselves.
Where will we put all this?
I don't know. I asked for hangers too.
There must be some...
Careful!
These things must be handled gently... with closed eyes!
Real dresses.
Looks like a child's dress.
Women's skirts are short now.
Just below the knee.
So I heard, I wish I could see them!
Put it on!
Not him, he's badly shaven.
- You, angel-face. - If it amuses you...
Here, take this.
We'll have to do a full inventory.
There's this too.
- And the corset!
- Careful!
They wear their hair short too.
Short hair!
Must seem like sleeping with a boy!
When the cat's away the mice will play!
I'm sure my wife hasn't cut her hair...
That's just for the bits of fluff.
How would you know, with that mug?
Shoes!
I'd forgotten they were so small.
Stockings!
Silk stockings!
I'm ready, boys.
Don't disturb our dreams yet.
If we see you, it'll ruin our illusions.
They're beautiful.
Black stockings!
A real girl!
Funny, isn't it?
Don't you think it looks funny?
It really does look funny.
Poor lads.
Enjoy yourselves.
On one side, children play at soldiers...
On the other, soldiers play like children.
I wish I knew what's going on at my home.
- No news?
- Nothing.
I don't care what my old woman's doing.
I want to clear out from sheer boredom.
You want to escape for the fun of it.
In my case, it's contrariness.
Now that I may not fight, I long to.
I just follow the crowd.
I'd rather do my bit with the rest.
I see no problem.
A golf course is for golf...
A tennis court for tennis...
A prison camp for escape.
What do you say, as a sportsman?
He was born in Jerusalem!
Wrong, Vienna!
My mother was Danish, my father Polish, naturalized French.
Good old French aristocracy!
And yet for all your old French stock, not one of you owns an acre of France.
In 35 years, the Rosenthals have acquired... three historic castles and all that goes with them:
hunting, farmland and horses.
And 3 galleries of genuine ancestors.
Believe me, it's worth escaping to fight for that.
I had never considered patriotism from that rather special point of view.
Your staff must feed like fighting cocks.
I got into it in a funny way.
I became a soldier because I'm a vegetarian.
That's right.
My brother and I had weak stomachs...
The doctor warned us off meat.
I turned vegetarian and was cured...
My brother went on eating meat...
He fell ill and was invalided out.
Your decorations show vegetarianism didn't interfere with duty.
It didn't stop my wife sleeping around either.
You must admit it's stirring.
I can't stand fifes.
Whatever you say, it gets you.
It isn't the music that gets you...
It's the marching feet.
With all this yapping, my trousers are ruined!
FORT DOUAUMONT HAS FALLEN!
Do we put on the show just the same?
Rather! We certainly do!
In fact we should invite the German officers.
Although I don't share your artistic interests, Maréchal...
I congratulate you...
Good show!
Do you know Marguerite?
She's not big and she's not small
With arousing eyes And a mouth like a child's
When I told this beauty That I loved her
She gave me flowers And called me a joker
I said, "Thanks for the flowers But that's not what I want
"If you want to make me happy Marguerite
"If you want to make me happy
"Marguerite, give me your heart!"
That same evening by the window
I sang to make her appear
"I'm sad because your pretty eyes Have set my heart alight!"
She, out of sheer kindness To put out my flame
Threw a bucket of water over me And said, "Happy now?"
I said, "Thanks for the bucket But that's not what I want
"If you want to make me happy Marguerite
"If you want to make me happy
"Marguerite, give me your heart!"
All together now!
And now... to Paris!
Get it, Arthur?
Stop it!
We've retaken Douaumont!
They announce it themselves!
What's the idea?
A little hole, to escape by.
DOUAUMONT RE-OCCUPIED BY GERMAN TROOPS
Did you see?
It's terrible.
Can't be much left of it!
Why, what's wrong?
Not hungry today?
Leave me alone! I can't take it any longer!
I'm fed up!
I want to see daylight!
It stinks in here!
You hear, it stinks! And I want to hear a friendly voice...
I want to hear French spoken...
I want to hear French spoken, do you hear?
Why was he shouting?
The war's lasting too long...
If my calculations are right... in four days, we'll be beyond the garden wall.
It means plenty of bags of earth!
Now we've a chance of escaping and reaching home again I'm afraid of what I'll find.
There's more than one woman on earth!
Not for me.
That's why she sleeps around.
One thing upsets me, leaving Maréchal behind.
I dislike it too. In fact... it irks me.
Sentiment has no place in war.
Good to see you, old man.
Same here. I'll tell you why in a minute.
Tell me, old man...
Is there anything to eat?
I'm hungry...
Sit down. Rosenthal's making some food.
What's the time?
Eleven o'clock.
How time drags today!
Never mind, tonight it's goodbye.
See you in Amsterdam.
I'm looking forward to the tulips in Holland.
What about the cheese?
Don't you like Dutch cheese?
Yes, but apparently the tulip fields stretch for miles and miles.
You're as romantic as a girl.
General roll-call at three.
All officers are to change camp.
Get your things ready.
A pleasant journey, gentlemen...
And I hope you will soon see your wives again.
Perhaps we should warn them.
- About what?
- The hole.
About the tunnel.
Careful.
We dug a tunnel in room 7, Sir.
A tunnel for escaping.
You not speak French.
Hole dug.
To escape.
Get back in line!
OFFICERS PRISON CAMP NÂ° 2
OFFICERS PRISON CAMP NÂ° 9
OFFICERS PRISON CAMP NÂ° 14
Open the window, it stinks in here.
I'm afraid there are only two pairs of white gloves left, Sir.
And we can't get any more, so try and make them last.
Yes, Sir... Some more coffee, Sir?
If you call that muck coffee, it's all right with me.
At least it will warm me up.
The list of new prisoners, Sir.
The new prisoners are here.
Hello, gentlemen.
Delighted to see you again, Boeldieu...
But sorry it should be here.
We too...
Sit down, gentlemen.
No, thank you, Sir.
At ease.
Captain de Boeldieu.
Four attempts at escape...
Via the boiler-room, a refuse pit...
Through the sewers, in a laundry basket.
Humility is sometimes a necessity...
I understand.
Lieutenant Maréchal, five attempts at escape.
Disguised as a sweep...
Pardon, Sir, hot-air expert.
Disguised as a German soldier, disguised as a woman.
Very funny, very funny indeed...
Not so funny when an N.C.O. took me for a woman, not to my taste at all!
- Really?
- Honestly!
Lieutenant Demolder, three attempts...
Gentlemen, I respect your patriotism and courage.
But here the situation is completely different.
No one can escape from this fortress.
You understand me, don't you?
So there can be no accusations of German barbarism,
I decided to apply French regulations.
Read it.
It makes good night-time reading.
And now, gentlemen, if you will follow me...
Oswald, my coat!
My men are not young, but they enjoy playing soldiers.
We have 25 like that.
I suppose you know the Maxim's gun?
Very well, Sir.
I prefer the restaurant.
Is that a dig at me?
Twelfth century.
Excuse me, Sir, but... was this villa built specially for Captain de Boeldieu and myself?
Sorry?
Are we your only guests?
No. Your comrades are behind there.
Thirteenth...
A drop of 120 feet.
Very kind of you to show us round your place.
A very handsome castle...
So old...
And so cheerful...
So sorry I can't give you a room to yourself.
Thank you, but I would not have accepted in any case.
I trust the walk did not tire you.
Not at all, Sir, we're fine.
- Fourteenth...
- It's pure Gothic.
Excuse me. We have to search you.
Your friend Lieutenant Rosenthal from Heilbard Camp is here.
- Good old Rosenthal!
- We've the same bad luck!
You are to share the same room.
That way you will have better food.
That's nice. Really nice.
A mere formality.
I'll tell the Commander anyway.
- In my case, it was a brunette.
- Who can you trust?
A friend of my mother's. She did a lot for charity.
Bad luck, it's not a very common disease in high society.
Eh, Boeldieu?
Yes... but it's a vanishing privilege.
Like so much else, it's become popularized.
Cancer and gout are not working-class diseases, but... they will be, believe me.
How about intellectuals?
In our case, it's tuberculosis.
Here's Mr Pindar!
And the middle-class?
Liver ulcers... they eat too much.
We'd each die of our own class ailment, if war didn't make all germs equal.
Your dictionaries are in my way.
Forgive me, but Pindar has always been so badly translated...
A sad oversight. I am broken-hearted.
Not that I care but who is Pindar?
But he means more to me than your life, the war, or my own life! Joke away!
Pindar is the greatest Greek poet.
The greatest Greek poet?
Well, I'm blowed...
There! My map's as near as dammit complete.
See... this is where we are.
16 miles above this bend of the Main.
To enter Switzerland above Lake Constance and bypass the Rhine, we'll have to cover...
- 200 miles.
- No kidding?
Reckon 15 nights forced march, on 6 lumps of sugar and 2 biscuits a day.
You're as crazy as he is with his Pindar!
To get out of this place...
There! My picture's finished.
Justice Pursues Crime...
Not bad is it?
Look here, to get to Lake Constance...
Will it hold?
It'll take 10 of you and 5 like me!
They're searching the rooms.
- Under the mattress, quick!
- No, under mine!
That's no good! Too obvious.
May I?
What a brainwave!
A very handy little gutter.
Here they are!
Gentlemen, room inspection!
Louise wrote to Victor:
"I am as weary as a girl after twenty-two nights of love..."
Twenty-two nights of love, imagine it!
Continue!
This part won't be searched!
Give me your word that there is nothing in here against regulations.
You have my word.
But why mine rather than the others?
The word of a... Rosenthal?
Or a Maréchal?
Their word is as good as ours.
Maybe.
No, not that book!
Poor old Pindar!
They're so ignorant...
Did it go all right for you here?
- Not bad.
- For us too.
And how's your cousin, Edmond de Boeldieu, who was Military Attaché in Berlin?
He is well and happy.
He lost an arm and married a very rich wife.
A fine career!
Remember her?
Sit down.
I'll tell you something...
Believe me... my present job disgusts me as much as you.
Strong words.
I used to be a fighter...
Now I am a civil servant...
a policeman.
But it's the only way in which I can still... appear to be serving my country.
Burns everywhere.
That is why I wear gloves.
Spine fractured in two places.
A silver plate.
My knee-cap is silver too.
This wealth I owe to the fortunes of war.
- May I ask a question?
- Of course.
Why did you make... an exception for me... inviting me here?
You are a de Boeldieu, a regular officer of the French Army.
And I a Rauffenstein, a regular officer of the Imperial German Army.
But... my friends are officers too.
A Maréchal and a Rosenthal, officers?
Good soldiers...
Thanks to your French Revolution!
I fear neither you nor I can arrest the march of time.
I don't know who will win this war...
The end, whatever it may be, will mean the end of the Rauffensteins and the Boeldieux.
We may be superfluous.
And don't you find it a pity?
Perhaps...
I admire your care of your geranium.
Not because I have turned botanist.
But it is the castle's only flower.
The only things that thrive here are ivy and nettles.
I'm glad I'm leaving with you.
With us.
Mind you, I like Boeldieu, but...
When I'm with him...
I never feel completely at ease...
Education, I suppose, but there's a barrier between us.
He's a fine type.
Agreed, and he's very decent, but...
Suppose you and I were broke, we'd both be beggars...
If it happened to him, he'd still be Monsieur de Boeldieu.
Anyway, haven't you been decent, feeding us with your parcels?
That's vanity...
I'm really proud of my rich family, and I invite you in order to show off.
Our great fault is said to be greed, we're often generous... unluckily, to balance this quality,
Jehovah gave us an overdose of pride.
I don't give a hang for Jehovah!
All I know is you're a good pal.
Comrades! Gentlemen!
We've received a large hamper, from the Empress.
Please come and share in it.
From the Empress?
It must be caviar.
- Come on, they've got some vodka!
- Vodka? With pleasure.
We shall be able to return your many kindnesses.
The Empress is a generous lady.
A swell gal!
Let the fun begin!
Books.
Principles of Algebra, Elementary Ethics, Grammar...
A cookery book!
Something to get your teeth into!
Quite unbelievable!
Come on, there's going to be trouble.
Goodbye and thanks anyway.
- The Cossacks are in a tizzy!
- It's hotting up now!
You have no right to burn books!
The guards are busy with the Russians.
It's high here, but no one around.
What a chance if we'd been ready!
- Growing dark too!
- We'll just have to do it again.
Very kind of them to rehearse us!
Now we know if one man causes a stir and keeps it up for 5 minutes, his friends could escape.
- Too risky!
- Don't let's exaggerate.
I should enjoy it.
When do you want to start?
Why us? You're in it too.
No, Maréchal.
Why not? Don't you trust us?
- That wouldn't stop me.
- Well then?
A plan like yours can only succeed with two...
And you get on well together...
- It's unfair.
- What's fair in war?
We can't accept.
I'm not asking advice,
I've made my decision.
The Arts aren't forbidden here...
You like music?
So-so... I like a good waltz.
I adore the flute...
Here's the program...
We'll buy flutes for everyone.
Each room will give a concert at 5p.m...
It grows dark then.
Five minutes later the flutes will be confiscated.
At 5.15, new concert with everything available.
Saucepans, animal cries, grinding of teeth, anything...
Result: roll-call in the courtyard.
Then?
That's my affair.
You'll have five minutes... to clear the walls and reach the woods.
Listen...
I don't know how to put it, but...
I feel awfully bad about it.
- Come now...
I'd like to say something...
Rinse my gloves with some warm water, will you...
Whatever happens, I want you to know that...
But...
I'm not doing it for you personally.
So no need to become sentimental.
Go on.
But there are times...
Let's avoid them, shall we?
Excuse me.
So you'll be wearing those?
Any objections?
No, but the idea of wearing white gloves wouldn't occur to me.
We all react differently.
You can't do anything like other people!
We've been together eighteen months, and you still stand on ceremony.
I am the same with my mother and my wife.
Well...
Cigarette?
No thanks, English tobacco gives me a sore-throat.
It's quite obvious! Gloves, tobacco...
We've nothing in common.
We've got things in hand here...
Of course, the old man is quite mad with his organ and flower-pot!
A good thing I'm here to control that gang of lunatics...
Before the war, I was a schoolmaster.
Lieutenant, confiscate those damn flutes at once!
I advise you not to start again!
We'll do just that in 15 minutes.
Your orders have been carried out, Sir.
You see, all's well.
And now, three days on bread and water and no mail!
Get ready, men.
Two seconds...
General roll-call!
I've never had so much fun.
Long may it last.
Well...
What?
Goodbye.
Boeldieu!
Listen!
I beg you, come back!
Lieutenants Maréchal and Rosenthal have escaped!
So that was why.
Switch on the searchlights!
Send out patrols with dogs!
Alert all military and civil authorities.
Report to me every quarter of an hour.
Your orders have been carried out, Sir.
No trace of the fugitives yet.
Thank you.
Forgive me...
I would have done the same.
French or German... duty is duty.
Are you in pain?
I didn't think a stomach wound hurt so.
I aimed at your leg.
The visibility was bad...
Besides... I was running.
Please don't excuse me...
I bungled it.
Of us two, I am not most to be pitied.
For me it will all be over... soon...
But you have to carry on.
Carry on a futile existence...
To be killed in a war is a tragedy for a commoner.
For you... and me... it's a good way out.
I missed my chance...
Don't try to talk too much.
We shouldn't stay so near the road!
The reeds were too wet to sleep in.
He's gone.
It was a woman!
- Come on.
- Wait till dark.
I'm frozen, I must move about.
Do you want your sugar?
There's not much left.
And we've a long way to go.
- What about you?
- I had mine before, I was hungry.
You keep it, so I won't be tempted. Poor chap...
Did you eat your buttons?
Does it show?
Aren't we going to wait till dark?
No, we'll just skirt the village.
Foot hurting?
It's nothing... a nerve.
Well, are you coming?
Are you coming or aren't you?
I'm doing my best.
You and your foot!
Not my fault! I slipped!
You slipped!
I'm sick of hearing it!
Is that what you'll say if we're caught?
Clumsy oaf!
We've no food, may as well give ourselves up.
- Willingly, I'm fed up too!
- With me?
Yes, fed up!
If you knew how I hate you!
I promise you it's mutual.
You're a dead weight round my neck!
Anyway I never could stick Jews!
A bit late to notice it!
Clear off, you're dying to.
Needn't say it twice!
Clear off!
I'm sick of your ugly mug!
I will!
You can manage on your own!
I hope I never see you again!
I feel like singing at the thought!
There was a little boat
That had never gone to sea
That had never gone to sea
After five or six weeks
The food started to get scarce...
Why have you come back?
Come on.
Come on, pal.
- Had enough?
- It's okay...
- We'll rest in that shed.
- Too risky.
- I can't see any smoke.
- Even so...
If your ship's on fire, you jump overboard.
Right, over we go!
Come on, then.
- Someone's here.
- Get out of the window, you can run.
I'll give you time.
Shut up and be quiet.
Don't move!
What are you up to?
We're Frenchmen...
French, you understand? We're not thieves.
Prisoners-of-war?
Do you speak German?
I've hurt my foot. We're done in.
We're not thieves.
I'm not afraid.
Call the police, I won't walk another step!
You've hurt your foot?
She says to go to the house.
No, I don't trust her.
She says she's alone at home.
Come in.
She says, don't make a noise, her child's asleep.
I'll be back in a moment.
Hungry? Oh, yes.
- She asks if you're hungry.
- I know that.
What about you?
I only want to sleep.
Sorry to disturb you!
How far is Wolfischeim?
8 miles.
I'd sooner stay with you than footslog there!
But duty's duty.
Thanks and goodnight.
Hush, my child's sleeping!
My husband.
Killed at Verdun.
My husband and brothers...
LiÃ¨ge, Charleroi, Tannenberg...
Our greatest victories!
The table's grown too big.
Keep calm, it's only me!
You don't mind if a Frenchman gives you your grub!
You smell good, like my grandfather's cows.
You're from Wurtemburg, I'm from Paris, but we can still be matey!
You're a poor cow, I'm a poor soldier.
We each do our best.
Clever girl!
We know everything, Mummy and I.
Really?
Well, how much milk does the cow give in a month?
Mummy knows. I can count on my fingers.
Fetch her some water.
I know, I know.
In camp I never grasped a word, but I understand her German.
Ich...
I... fetch... Wasser.
A bit flea-bitten!
I did my best.
I was talking to Father Christmas.
Joseph has a fine beard!
And here's the Virgin Mary.
You like my little donkey?
And my ox?
And the infant Jesus... of my own race?
"A dig at me", as Boeldieu would say.
- I wonder if he's all right.
- Better not talk about it.
We're ready.
Let's wake Lotte.
Hang on. The gramophone and the candles.
Lights out!
Lotte! Baby Jesus has come.
I knew He would!
- Is it for me?
I want the baby!
To take to bed?
No, to eat.
It's not to eat!
She wants to eat Baby Jesus!
"Strictly forbidden"!
Then I'll eat Joseph!
- What?
- She wants Joseph.
She wants Joseph? There you go then. Come on, to bed!
You're a good little girl.
That thing's on the blink!
How do you say "Lotte has blue eyes"?
Good night, kiddo!
I don't know how to thank you.
Thank us?
What can we say?
Well... goodnight.
I'll get the coffee.
It's ready.
Say it in French.
Have you told her we're leaving? Not yet.
It's high time...
You go and tell her...
- We must go on...
- I know.
Maréchal couldn't bear to tell you.
Why?
I always knew he'd have to go.
Come along...
There's hot coffee.
You must eat something before you go.
Do we wait for dusk?
Yes.
Lotte! Let's say goodbye to the cow.
I was alone so long...
Waiting so long...
If you knew how happy I was to have a man about the house.
After war finished, if...
If I... not dead... understand?
Then I... come back here... yes?
And you... afterwards... go... with me... to France...
Here, for the journey.
Go quickly, it's better.
- You're not looking back?
- If I do, I might never leave.
- Let's go.
- Wait till dark. We'd lose our way.
The woods are so thick... We'll crawl through the valley.
You're sure that's Switzerland?
- I'm sure of it.
- It's all so alike!
Of course, frontiers were invented by men, not by Nature.
I wish it were over.
I shall go back for Elsa.
- You love her?
- I reckon so.
Yet if we get through, we'll go back to our units and start again.
We've got to end this damn war... and make it the last!
What an illusion!
Come down to earth.
What if we meet a patrol?
We split up, and try our luck.
Just in case, cheerio and so long!
- So long, you "dirty Jew"!
- So long, "old mate"!
Don't shoot, they're in Switzerland!
All the better for them!
Slave in the Magic Mirror, come from the farthest space.
Through wind and darkness, I summon thee. Speak!
Let me see thy face.
What wouldst thou know, my Queen?
Magic Mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?
Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.
But hold, a lovely maid I see.
Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.
Alas, she is more fair than thee.
Alas for her!
Reveal her name.
Lips red as the rose.
Hair black as ebony.
Skin white as snow.
Snow White!
Want to know a secret?
Promise not to tell?
We are standing bу a wishing well
Make a wish into the well
That's all уou have to do
Аnd if уou hear it eсhoing
Your wish will soon come true
-I'm wishing -I'm wishing
For the one I love
-To find me -To find me
-Today -Today
-I'm hoрing -I'm hoрing
Аnd I'm dreaming of
-The niсe things -The niсe things
-Нe'll say -Нe'll say

-Oh! -Hello.
-Oh. -Did I frighten you?
Wait!
Wait, please.
Don't run away.
Now that I've found you
Нear what I have to say
One song I have but one song
One song onlу for you
One heart tenderlу beating
Ever entreating
Сonstant and true
One love That has рossessed me
One love Thrilling me through
One song My heart keeрs singing
Of one love Onlу for you
Take her far into the forest.
Find some secluded glade where she can pick wildflowers.
Yes, Your Majesty.
And there, my faithful Huntsman, you will kill her!
But, Your Majesty, the little Princess!
Silence!
You know the penalty if you fail.
Yes, Your Majesty.
But to make doubly sure you do not fail,
bring back her heart in this.
One song, I have but one song
Hello there. What's the matter?
Where's your mama and papa?
Why, I believe you're lost.
Oh, please don't cry.
Come on, perk up.
Won't you smile for me?
That's better.
Your mama and papa can't be far.
There they are!
Can you fly?
Good-bye.
Good-bye!
I can't, I can't do it. Forgive me.
I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.
I don't understand!
She's mad, jealous of you!
She'll stop at nothing!
-But, but who?
-The Queen.
-The Queen? -Now, quick, child, run.
Run away, hide!
In the woods! Anywhere! Never come back!
Now, go. Go!
Run! Run! Hide!
Please don't run away.
I won't hurt you.
I'm awfully sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you.
But you don't know what I've been through.
And all because I was afraid.
I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made.
What do you do when things go wrong?
Oh! You sing a song!
With a smile and a song
Life is just like a bright, sunny day
Your сares fade away
Аnd your heart is young
With a smile and a song
Аll the world seems to waken anew
Rejoiсing with you Аs the song is sung
There's no use in grumbling
When raindroрs сome tumbling
Remember you're the one
Who сan fill the world with sunshine
When you smile and you sing
Everything is in tune and it's sрring
Аnd life flows along
With a smile and a song
I really feel quite happy now.
I'm sure I'll get along somehow.
Everything's going to be all right.
But I do need a place to sleep at night.
I can't sleep in the ground like you or in a tree the way you do.
And I'm sure no nest would possibly be big enough for me.
Maybe you know where I can stay.
In the woods somewhere?
You do?
Will you take me there?
Oh, it's adorable!
Just like a doll's house.
I like it here.
Ooh, it's dark inside.
Guess there's no one home.
Hello? May I come in?
What a cute little chair!
Why, there's seven little chairs!
Must be seven little children.
And from the look of this table, seven untidy little children.
A pickaxe.
And a shoe!
And just look at that fireplace.
It's covered with dust.
And look, cobwebs everywhere!
My, my, my!
What a pile of dirty dishes!
And just look at that broom!
Why, they've never swept this room.
You'd think their mother would...
Maybe they have no mother.
Then they're orphans.
That's too bad.
I know!
We'll clean the house and surprise them.
Then maybe they'll let me stay.
Now, you wash the dishes.
You tidy up the room.
You clean the fireplace.
And I will use the broom.
Just whistle while you work
Аnd сheerfully together we сan tidy uр the рlaсe
So hum a merry tune lt won't take long when there's a song to helр you set the рaсe
Аnd as you sweeр the room lmagine that the broom ls someone that you love and soon you'll find you're danсing to the tune
Oh, no, no, no, no! Put them in the tub.
When hearts are high the time will fly
So whistle while you work
Not under the rug.
So whistle while you work
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig ln our mine the whole day through
To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig is what we like to do lt ain't no triсk to get riсh quiсk lf ya dig, dig, dig with a shovel or a рiсk
-In a mine
-In a mine
-Where a million diamonds
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
From early morn 'til night
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig uр everything in sight
We dig uр diamonds by the sсore
А thousand rubies Sometimes more
Though we don't know what we dig 'em for
We dig, dig, dig-a-dig, dig

Let's see what's upstairs.
Oh, what adorable little beds!
And look, they have their names carved on them.
Doc, Happy,
Sneezy, Dopey...
What funny names for children!
Grumpy, Bashful and Sleepy.
I'm a little sleepy myself.
Нeigh-ho, heigh-ho lt's home from work we go

Our house! The lit's light... The light's lit.
Jiminy Crickets!
-The door is open. -The chimney's smoking.
-Something's in there. -Maybe a ghost.
-Or a goblin.
Or a dragon.
Mark my words, there's trouble a-brewin'.
Felt it coming all day.
My corns hurt.
-Gosh!
-That's a bad sign.
-What'll we do?
-Let's sneak up on it.
Yes. We'll squeak up...
Come on, hen... Men. Follow me.
Careful, men. Search every cook and nanny...
Hook and granny... Crooked fan...
Search everywhere.
Quiet.
Look! The floor, it's been swept!
Chair's been dusted!
Our window's been washed.
Gosh, our cobwebs are missing.
Why, why, why, why, the whole place is clean!
There's dirty work afoot.
Sink's empty.
Hey, someone stole our dishes!
They ain't stole. They're hid in the cupboard.
My cup's been washed.
Sugar's gone.
Something's cooking.
Smells good!
Don't touch it, you fools!
Might be poison.
See? It's witches' brew.
Look what's happened to our stable...
Flowers!
-Huh? -Look, goldenrod.
Don't do it. Take them away.
My nose! My hay fever!
You know I can't stand it.
I can't... I can't... I...
Thanks!
Ya crazy fool!
Fine time you picked to sneeze!
I couldn't help it.
I can't tell. When you gotta, you gotta.
I... I... I gotta.
It's coming.
-Don't let him. -Stop him. Oh!
-No, tie it tight. -Don't let go.
-Hold him tight. -I'll tie it.
Make a hard knot.
There, that will hold him.
Thanks!
Quiet, you fool!
You want to get us all killed?
-What's that?
-That's it.
-Sounded close.
-It's in this room right now.
-It's up there.
-Yeah. In the bedroom.
One of us has gotta go down and chase it up.
Up. Down.
Here, take it.
Don't be nervous.
Don't be afraid.
We're right behind you.
Yes! Right behind ya.
Here it comes!
-It's after us. -Don't let it out.
-Here it comes. -Now's our chance.
Get it now!
-Quick! -Give it to it!
Don't let it get away!
Hold on there. It's only Dopey.
-Did you see it?
-How big is it?
-Was it a dragon?
-Has it got horns?
-Was it breathing fire?
-Was it droolin'?
What was it doin'?
He says it's a, a monster asleep in our beds! -Let's attack.
-While it's sleeping.
Yeah, while it's sleeping.
-Hurry, men.
It's now or never! -Off with its head.
-Break its bones.
-Chop it to pieces.
We'll kill it dead.
-Jiminy Crickets!
-Gosh! -Gee!
-What a monster!
It covers three beds.
Let's kill it before it wakes up.
Which end do we kill?
-What is it?
-Why, it... It's a girl!
She's mighty purdy.
She's beautiful, just like a angel.
Angel, hah!
She's a female!
And all females is poison!
They're full of wicked wiles.
What are wicked wiles?
I don't know. But I'm agin 'em.
Not so loud. You'll wake her up.
Let her wake up! She don't belong here nohow.
-Look out. -She's movin'.
-She's waking' up.
-What'll we do?
Hide.
Oh, dear.
I wonder if the children are...
Why, why, you're little men!
How do you do?
-I said, how do you do?
-How do you do what?
Oh, you can talk! I'm so glad!
Now, don't tell me who you are.
Let me guess.
I know, you're Doc.
Why, why, why, yes. Yes! That's true.
And you're, you're Bashful.
Oh, gosh!
And you, you're Sleepy.
How'd you guess?
And you?
And you're Sneezy.
-Yes, and you must be... -Happy, ma'am.
That's me.
And this is Dopey.
He don't talk none.
-You mean he can't talk?
-He don't know. He never tried.
Oh, that's too bad.
You must be Grumpy.
Oh, yes! Yes!
We know who we are.
Ask her who she is and what she's a-doin' here.
Yeah!
What are you and who are you doin'?
What are you...
Who are you, my dear?
Oh, how silly of me. I'm Snow White.
-Snow White? -The Princess?
Yes.
Well, my, my dear Quincess... Princess.
We're, we're honoured.
Yes, we're, we're... -Mad as hornets!
-Mad as hornets! No, no, we're not. We're bad as cornets...
No, no, as bad as...
What was I sayin'?
Nothing! Just standin' there sputtering' like a doodlebug!
Who, who, who, who's buttering' like a spoodledug?
-Who's... Gutter... -Shut up and tell her to get out!
Please don't send me away!
-If you do, she'll kill me.
-Kill you? -Who will? -Yes, who?
-My stepmother, the Queen.
-The Queen?
-She's wicked! -She's bad!
-She's mighty mean!
-She's an old witch!
I'm warnin' ya.
If the Queen finds her here, she'll swoop down and wreak her vengeance on us!
But she doesn't know where I am!
She don't, eh?
She knows everything.
She's full of black magic.
She can even make herself invisible.
Might be in this room right now.
Oh, she'll never find me here.
And if you let me stay, I'll keep house for you.
I'll wash and sew and sweep and cook and...
Cook?
Can you make dapple lumpkins...
Lumple dapplins?
-Apple dumplings!
-Eh, yes! Crapple dumpkins.
Yes, and plum pudding and gooseberry pie...
Gooseberry pie? Hooray! She stays!
Soup!
Hooray!
Just a minute.
Supper's not quite ready.
You'll just have time to wash.
Wash? Wash? -Wash?
Knew there was a catch to it.
-What for? We ain't goin' nowhere.
'Tain't New Year's.
Oh, perhaps you have washed.
Perhaps we...
-Yes! Perhaps we have.
-But when?
When? When. You said whe...
Why, last week.
Why, recently!
Yes, recently!
Oh, recently!
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands!
Why, Doc, I'm surprised!
Come on, let's see them.
Oh, Bashful, my, my, my!
And you?
Worse than I thought!
How shocking!
Goodness me, this will never do.
March straight outside and wash, or you'll not get a bite to eat.
Well, aren't you going to wash?
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?
Did you hurt yourself?
Hah, women!
Courage, men, courage.
Don't be nervous.
Gosh, it's wet!
It's cold, too!
We ain't gonna do it, are we?
Well, it'll please the Princess.
I'll take a chance for her!
Me, too!
Her wiles are beginning' to work.
But I'm warnin' ya, you give 'em an inch, and they'll walk all over ya!
Don't listen to that old warthog.
Come on now, men.
-How hard do ya scrub?
-Will our whiskers shrink?
Do ya get in the tub?
Do ya have to wash where it doesn't show?
Now, now, now, don't get excited. Here we go.
Steр uр to the tub 'Tain't no disgraсe
Just рull uр your sleeves and get 'em in рlaсe
Then sсooр uр the water and rub it on your faсe and go...
Piсk uр the soaр Now don't try to bluff
Work uр a lather Аnd when you got enough
Get your hands full of water and you snort and you snuff and go...
You douse and you souse Rub and you sсrub
You sрutter and sрlash all over the tub
You may be сold and wet when you're done
Вut you gotta admit it's good and сlean fun

Bunch of old nanny goats. Ya make me sick going...
Hah!
Next thing ya know she'll be tying' your beards up in pink ribbons and smelling' ya up with that stuff called "perfoom."
A fine bunch of water lilies you turned out to be.
I'd like to see anybody make me wash if I didn't wanna.
Get him!
Hey, let go of me!
Get him over to the tub.
Get him over to the tub. Let me loose, you fools!
Get him up on the tub. Get him up! Hang on to him!
Get him up on the tub! On the tub.
That's the tub.

Don't, don't, don't, don't get excited!
Don't get... Don't get up...

You'll pay dearly for this!
Supper!
-Supper! -Food.
Magic Mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?
Over the seven jewelled hills beyond the seventh fall, in the cottage of the seven dwarfs dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.
Snow White lies dead in the forest.
The Huntsman has brought me proof.
Behold her heart.
Snow White still lives, the fairest in the land.
'Tis the heart of a pig you hold in your hand.
The heart of a pig!
Then I've been tricked!
The heart of a pig!
The blundering fool!
I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage in a disguise so complete no one will ever suspect.
Now, a formula to transform my beauty into ugliness, change my queenly raiment to a peddler's cloak.
Mummy dust to make me old.
To shroud my clothes, the black of night.
To age my voice, an old hag's cackle.
To whiten my hair, a scream of fright.
A blast of wind to fan my hate!
A thunderbolt to mix it well.
Now, begin thy magic spell.
Look!
My hands!
My voice!
My voice.
A perfect disguise.
And now...
A special sort of death for one so fair.
What shall it be?
A poisoned apple!
Sleeping Death.
I'd like to danсe and taр my feet
Вut they won't keeр in rhythm
You see, I washed 'em both today and I сan't do nothin' with 'em
Нo-hum, the tune is dumb The words don't mean a thing isn't this a silly song for anyone to sing?
I...
Oh, gosh!
I сhased a рoleсat uр a tree Way out uрon a limb
Аnd when he got the best of me I got the worst of him
Нo-hum, the tune is dumb The words don't mean a thing isn't this a silly song for anyone to sing?
Be ca... Watch... Watch...
Watch... Watch...
Thanks.
That was fun!
Now you do something.
Well, what shall I do?
-Tell us a story.
-Yes, tell us a story.
-A true story.
-A love story.
Well, once there was a princess.
Was the princess you?
-And she fell in love.
-Was it hard to do?
Oh, it was very easy.
Anyone could see that the Prince was charming.
The only one for me.
Was he strong and handsome?
Was he big and tall?
There's nobody like him anywhere at all.
Did he say he loved ya?
Did he steal a kiss?
Нe was so romantiс
I сould not resist
Some daу mу рrince will come
Some daу we'll meet again
Аnd away to his сastle we'll go
To be haррy forever
I know
Hah! Mush!
Some daу when sрring is here
We'll find our love anew
Аnd the birds will sing
Аnd wedding bells will ring
Some daу when mу dreams
Сome true
Oh, my goodness!
It's past bedtime.
Go right upstairs to bed.
Wait! Hold on there, men!
The Princess will sleep in our beds upstairs.
But where will you sleep?
Oh, we'll be quite comfortable down here in...in...
In a pig's eye!
In a pig's eye... Sty. No, no!
I mean... We'll be comfortable, won't we, men?
Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable.
Now don't you worry about us.
-We'll be all right, ma'am.
-Go right on up now, my dear.
Well, if you insist.
Good night.
Good night, Princess.
You're sure you'll be comfortable?
Oh, yes. Very comfortable.
Well, pleasant dreams.
Pleasant dreams.
Let go!
-Now, men, don't get excited.
Remember, share. It's share and share alike.
Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!
Bless the seven little men who have been so kind to me.
And... And may my dreams come true.
Amen.
Oh, yes! And please make Grumpy like me.
Hah! Women!
A fine kettle of fish!
Dip the apple in the brew.
Let the Sleeping Death seep through!
Look! On the skin!
The symbol of what lies within.
Now, turn red to tempt Snow White.
To make her hunger for a bite.
Have a bite?
It's not for you.
It's for Snow White.
When she breaks the tender peel to taste the apple in my hand, her breath will still, her blood congeal.
Then I'll be fairest in the land!
But wait!
There may be an antidote.
Nothing must be overlooked.
Oh, here it is!
"Love's First Kiss."
No fear of that.
The dwarfs will think she's dead.
She'll be buried alive!
Buried alive!
Thirsty?
Have a drink!
Now, don't forget, my dear. The...
The old Queen's a sly one, full of witchcraft.
So beware of strangers.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
See you tonight.
Yes.
We... Well, c'mon, men.
Be awful careful 'cause if anything'd happen to you, I, I...
-Good-bye.
-Oh, gosh!
Hah! Disgustin'!
And be sure to watch out... To wa...

Watch out.
Thanks.
All right.
But that's the last...
Oh, go on. Run along.
Нeigh-ho, heigh-ho lt's off to work we go
Good-bye! Good-bye!
Now I'm warnin' ya.
Don't let nobody or nothin' in the house.
Why, Grumpy, you do care.
Good-bye, Grumpy!
The little men will be away and she'll be all alone with a harmless old peddler woman.
A harmless old peddler woman!
Some daу mу рrince will come

All alone, my pet?
Why, why, yes, I am. But...
The, the little men are not here?
No, they're not, but...
Making pies?
Yes, gooseberry pies.
It's apple pies that make the menfolks' mouths water.
Pies made from apples like these.
-Oh, they do look delicious.
-Yes! But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.
Like to try one?
Go on. Go on, have a bite.
Stop it! Stop it! Go away!
Go away! Shame on you, frightening a poor old lady.
Oh, I thought I'd lost it.
There, there. I'm sorry.
Oh! My heart!
Oh, my... My poor heart.
Take me into the house and let me rest.
A drink of water, please.
Нeigh-ho, heigh-ho
Нeigh-ho, heigh-ho lt's off to work we go
Нeigh-ho, heigh-ho
Hey, look!
-Stop that! -Get away, boy. Get away!
Go on! Get outta here!
What ails these crazy birds?
They've gone plumb daffy.
Yeah, they've...
And because you've been so good to poor old Granny,
I'll share a secret with you.
This is no ordinary apple.
It's a magic wishing apple.
A wishing apple?
Yes!
One bite and all your dreams will come true.
-Really?
-Yes, girlie.
Now, make a wish and take a bite.
-Go on, get! -These pesky critters won't stop.
-'Tain't natural.
They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.
Maybe the old Queen's got Snow White.
-The Queen! -Snow White!
The Queen'll kill her! We gotta save her!
Yes! Yes! We, we, we gotta save her!
-She'll kill her! -What'll we do?
Yes, yes, what'll we do?
Come on! Giddap!
Wait for me! Wait for...
There must be something your little heart desires.
Perhaps there's someone you love.
Well, there is someone.
I thought so. I thought so!
Old Granny knows a young girl's heart.
Now, take the apple, dearie, and make a wish.
I wish... I wish...
That's it, go on! Go on.
And that he will carry me away to his castle where we will live happily ever after.
Fine! Fine! Now take a bite.
Don't let the wish grow cold!
Oh, I feel strange.
-Her breath will still.
-Her blood congeal. -Oh.
Now I'll be fairest in the land!
Hurry, hurry.
There she goes!
After her!
I'm trapped! What will I do?
The meddling little fools!
I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya.
I'll fix ya! I'll crush your bones!
Look out!

Сome true!
News has come from Vienna!
"Leopold of Austria has seized King Richard on his return from the Crusades.
Our king is being held prisoner. Nothing further is known.
His Highness Prince John will make...
... furtherpublic pronouncement tomorrow."
And how are the dear Saxons taking the news, Sir Guy?
They're even more worried than Longchamps, Your Highness.
They'll be more than worried  whenI squeezethefat  out of their pampered hides.
-You intend to act on your plans?
-What better moment than this, Sir Guy?
Whoever would have thought my dear brother...
... wouldbeso  considerate as to get captured...
... andleaveallEngland to my tender care?
He may disapprove when he returns, Your Highness.
If he returns. And I'll see to it that he doesn't.
We must drink to this moment, Sir Guy. Golden days are ahead.
I'll assign tax districts to you tomorrow.
Tomorrow, Your Highness.
-But who's gonna pay me?
-Pay! Pay!
That's all you Saxons think about.
Didn't I tell you it was for Prince John, who's just come up from London?
Stop! Stop!
This man is freeborn! He's a landowner.
You can't make a slave of him!
Didn't he refuse to send his men to work in Guy of Gisbourne's field?
But I protest--!
Dickon, follow me! The rest remain here.
-What's your name, you Saxon dog?
-A better one than yours.
Look to your manners! This is Sir Guy of Gisbourne.
Sir Guy or the devil! There's little to choose between them.
-What's your name?
-Much, the miller's son.
-It's death to kill the king's deer.
-And death from hunger if I don't.
Thanks to you and the rest of you Norman cutthroats at Nottingham Castle.
-Be quiet, you.
-I won't be quiet!
You can kill me if you like, but not until I've had my say.
You can beat and starve us Saxons now...
... but when King Richard escapes, he'll take you by the scruff of the neck...
... andflingyouintothesea!
-What the devil?
-Come now, Sir Guy.
-You'd not kill a man for telling the truth?
-lf it amused me, yes.
Be thankful my humor's of a different sort.
By what right do you interfere with justice?
By a better right than you have to misuse it.
That goes for your master, Prince John.
I'll give him that message at the baron's meeting in Nottingham tonight.
Thank you. He does need a bit of a talking to.
-Eh, Will?
-He has been getting rather out of hand.
-Fetch him along.
-Hold there. What's his fault?
-He's killed a royal deer.
-You're wrong. I killed that deer.
This man's my servant.
I suppose you realize the penalty for killing the king's deer is death.
-Whether for serf or noble.
-Really?
Are there no exceptions?
-Thanks, good master.
-Better look before you shoot next time.
From this day, I follow only you.
There isn't a poor Saxon in Nottingham shire  that doesn't know and bless Sir Robin of Locksley.
Take me as your servant.
Why, in all the forest, there isn't a hunter as good as me.
I ask no pay. Just to follow you.
Fetch the deer, then.
While Richard is bent on adventure in foreign lands...
... itisourdutyasNormans to preserve the realm...
... bygivingloyalsupport to Prince John...
... theonlytruedefender of the Norman spirit.
Hail to Prince John.
My lords, I thank you. Well, this is what we Normans like:
Good food, good company...
... anda beautifulwoman to flatter me, eh, Lady Marian?
Was it worthwhile coming with me from London...
... toseewhatstoutfellows our Nottingham friends are?
Take Sir Guy of Gisbourne.
One of our most renowned defenders of the realm.
-Must I take him, Your Highness?
-Why, you like him, don't you?
-Well, he's a Norman, of course.
-Is that the only reason for liking him?
Isn't that reason enough for a royal ward who must obey her guardian?
Oh, nay, I'd not force you, my lady.
But he's our most powerful friend in these shires and he's in love with you.
If I could promise him marriage to a royal ward, it might help my plans.
-Perhaps when I know him better.
-Of course.
You're a very wise young woman.
Any more objections to the new tax from our Saxon friends?
Objections, Your Highness?
With a Saxon dangling from every... ... gallowstree between here and Charnwood?
Well said, sir knight. But not too many, mind.
Else we'll have nobody left to till our land or pay the tax.
There's one exception I'd make, Your Highness.
-A certain Saxon noble.
-Who is that?
-Sir Robin of Locksley.
-Sir Rob- - Sir Robin of Locksley?
I've heard precious little else since I've been here.
What's his latest outrage?
Oh, nothing less than killing a royal deer in Sherwood Forest today.
And you didn't take him?
That would have been a problem, Your Highness.
-A Saxon a problem?
-He's a notorious troublemaker, my lady.
Aye. An impudent, reckless rogue...
... whogoesaroundthe shire stirring up the Saxons against authority.
And he has the insolence to set himself up as a protector of the people.
I could have captured him long ago, but... .
But what?
Well, he's the deadliest archer in England, and... .
And my brave High Sheriff of Nottingham is afraid of him.
I want him taken and hanged. At once, do you hear?
I'll not tolerate--
Open the door!
Who is this, this... ?
Sir Robin of Locksley, Your Highness.
Let him approach.
Greetings, Your Highness.
You should teach Gisbourne hospitality.
I no sooner enter his castle doors with a piece of meat...
... thanhisstarvingservants try to snatch it from me.
You should feed them, Gisbourne. They'll work better.
With the compliments of your royal brother, King Richard, God bless him!
By my faith, but you're a bold rascal.
Robin, I like you.
I'm gratified, Your Highness.
I don't think Gisbourne shares that sentiment, however.
He does look sour.
What's the matter, Gisbourne? Run out of hangings?
-I know a ripe subject for one.
-lf you'll excuse me--
Sit down! Sit down, my dear. He'll not harm you.
Sir Robin, this is the Lady Marian Fitzwalter.
I hope my lady had a pleasant journey from London?
What you hope can hardly be important.
What a pity her manners don't match her looks, Your Highness.
You hear that, gentlemen?
Here's Gisbourne so in love with Marian he daren't say "boo" to her  andthissaucyfellow gives her better than she sends.
My lords and ladies, I would like to present to you Sir Robin of Locksley.
Sir Robin, permit me to present to you your host, Sir Guy of Gisbourne...
-... andournobleguests.
-I'm deeply honored, Your Highness.
-Have you had meat?
-None but what I brought.
Well, sit down. Sit down there opposite me.
-Get up, Sir Ivor. Give him your place. -Your Highness!
Get up! Get up, sir knight!
Come, Sir Ivor. Out with you.
Bring Sir Robin food at once, do you hear?
Such impudence must support a mighty appetite.
True enough, Your Highness.
We Saxons have little to fatten on by the time your tax gatherers are through.
Be seated, gentlemen.
No need to stand on ceremony on my account.
So you think you're overtaxed, eh?
Overtaxed, overworked and paid off with a knife, a club or a rope.
-Why, you speak treason.
-Fluently.
I advise you to curb that wagging tongue of yours!
It's a habit I've never formed.
You know, we Saxons aren't gonna put up with these oppressions much longer.
Oh, you're not? Then listen to this:
As you may know, my brother is a prisoner of Leopold of Austria.
And from Leopold, I have received a ransom demand of 1 50,000 gold marks.
That means that you, my friends...
... mustcollectin taxesnot 2gold marks in the pound, but 3!
And the money's to be turned over to me.
Why to you, Your Highness?
King Richard appointed Longchamps regent.
I've kicked Longchamps out.
From now on, I am regent of England.
Well, confound it, what are you goggling at?
Is it so strange that I decide to rule when my brother's a prisoner?
Who's to say I shouldn't?
-You, Sir Mortimer of Leeds?
-Not I, Your Highness.
-You, Sir Boron?
-Nor I, Your Highness.
-You, Sir Ralf of Durham?
-My sword is yours, Your Highness.
And what about our young Saxon cockerel here?
What's the matter? Have you no stomach for honest meat?
For honest meat, yes. But I've no stomach for traitors.
-You call me traitor?
-You? Yes.
And every man here who offers you allegiance.
Your Highness.
What do you call a man who takes advantage of a king's misfortune  toseizehispower?
And now, with the help of this sweet band of cutthroats...
... you'll try to grind a ransom for him out of every helpless Saxon.
A ransom that'll be used not to release Richard...
... buttobuyyourwaytothe throne .
Let me ram those words down his throat, Your Highness!
Oh, no. Later. Let him spout for the moment.
And what do you propose to do?
I'll organize revolt. Exact a death for a death.
And I'll never rest until every Saxon in this shire can stand up, free men...
... andstrikeablow for Richard and England.
-Have you finished?
-I'm only just beginning.
From this night on, I use every means in my power to fight you.
Dickon!
Such impudence, Your Highness. If I could only reach him.
Stand back! Stand back!
Open the door!
Quick, guards, quick!
There's a traitor inside trying to escape!
-Shut the door, quick!
-Traitor, sir?
You infernal idiot! Which way did he go?
There, through the gate.
-After him!
-Guards! Horses!
Dickon, follow Mansfield! To your troop!
Up you go, quick.
Tell Crippen the arrow-maker and his friends...
... topassthewordtoevery man who's been beaten or tortured:
The Gallows Oaks in Sherwood tomorrow.
-Yes, master.
Have it proclaimed in every village that this Saxon Locksley's an outlaw.
Hang anybody that gives him shelter or aid.
Yes, Your Highness.
His possessions are forfeit to the crown.
Seize his castle and his lands.
Everything he owns.
And just to let the people know how the wind has changed...
-... thesooneryoubegincollectingthe--
-The ransom, Your Highness?
Yes, yes, of course. The ransom.
There's a death sentence for your Robin of Locksley!
I'll have him dangling in a week.
-I'm tired.
-What?
After a refreshing sleep in the greenwood?
I've pulled seven acorns out of my ribs.
-Lovely fresh air.
-My teeth ache with chattering.
-Nightingales singing.
-An owl hooting in my ear all night.
Hooting? He was singing you to sleep.
There's a lusty infant.
He'd be a good one to reason into joining us.
By the look of him, his quarterstaff does his reasoning for him.
-Let's see what he's made of.
-It's your skull, not mine.
-Give way, little man.
-Only to a better man than myself.
He stands before you.
Let him pass, Robin.
It's much too warm to brawl with such a windbag.
When I've brushed this fly off, I'll give you a dusting for good measure.
This fly has a mighty sting, friend.
I've only a staff and you threaten me with a longbow and a goose shaft.
-Aren't you man enough--?
-Wait! I'll get myself a staff.
-Ready?
-Yes.
Pretty fellow, play a livelier tune that I can make this puny rascal dance to.
You need a merrier tune? Well, how's this?
If you want a lesson, you came to the right man!
-Where is he?
-Who?
-This quarterstaff master.
-Here.
Give my compliments to him.
My friend, I should ask payment for what I'm teaching you here today.
There's something on account.
There's your change.
My head hums like a swarm of bees.
What's your name, friend?
-John Little. What's yours?
-Robin.
-Not Robin of Locksley?
-Aye.
-Then I'm right glad I fell in with you.
-'Twas he who did the falling in.
I wanted to see what you were made of. And I did.
-I hope you'll not hold it against me.
-On the contrary.
-I love a man that can best me.
-I'd like to join your company.
You shall.
If you can hold a breach like you held that bridge...
... you're one of us. Welcome.
-This is Will of Gamwell.
-Yeah.
-He took care not to wet his feathers.
-Just brain over brawn, friend.
You heard Robin's orders.
Look nippy now and spread the word.
"By royal decree, Robin of Locksley  isdeclaredan outlaw, condemned to death."
Meet Robin in Sherwood at Gallows Oaks.
"Any person aiding him will be hanged."
Meet Robin in Sherwood at Gallows Oaks.
Robin in Sherwood.
At the Gallows Oak.
Robin in Sherwood.
Robin. Gallows Oak.
Gallows Oak.
I've called you here as freeborn Englishmen, loyal to our king.
While he reigned over us we lived in peace.
But since Prince John has seized the regency...
... GuyofGisbourneand his traitors have murdered and pillaged.
You've all suffered from their cruelty.
The ear loppings, the beatings...
... theblindingswithhot irons, the burning of our homes...
... themistreatmentof ourwomen.
It's time we put an end to this!
-Robin's right.
-Aye!
Now, this forest is wide.
It can shelter, clothe and feed a band of good, determined men...
... goodswordsmen,goodarchers, good fighters!
Men, if you're willing to fight for our people, I want you.
Aye! Aye!
Then kneel and swear this oath.
That you, the freemen of this forest, swear to despoil the rich...
... onlytogivetothepoor.
To shelter the old and helpless...
... toprotectallwomen, rich or poor, Norman or Saxon.
Swear to fight for a free England.
To protect her loyally until the return of our king and sovereign...
... RichardtheLion-Heart.
And swear to fight to the death against our oppressors!
We do! We do solemnly swear!
String him up again!
-He'll die if we lash him again, my lord.
-Oh, he'll die, will he?
Another one of their Saxon impudences.
They'll do anything to trick us.
Continue!
-Mercy, good master! Have mercy! -Start him dancing!
This will teach you to defy Prince John!
Father! Father!
Stop!
Five men dead. Murdered.
Sir Ivor, Nigel, Baldwin, Norbert.
-You don't have to name them.
-Our men can't lay a hot iron  intheeyesofa taxdodgerwithout getting an arrow in the throat.
-He's got to be stopped!
-Have you tried to stop him?
Yes, but I couldn't find him.
What chance has anyone of finding him?
Every villager and woodcutter's his friend.
Every runaway serf and Saxon thief in the shire is joining him.
I've sent spies in the forest to find out his hiding place...
-... buthestrikes,and gonelike aflash .
-While you stay safely at home.
Do you question my valor?
Am I not personally commanding the force...
... thatgoeswithSir Guy and  Lady Marian to Kenworth Castle...
... toguardthetax moneyheis bringing back, with my sword and my life?
I only hope this murderer does come out of his hiding place.
You hope!
Enough of this wrangling!
I'll lay this outlaw by the heels when I get back.
Well, well. A curtal friar, and a mighty fat one at that.
-He's the man we need. I'll enlist him.
-Be careful, Robin.
That's the friar of Fountain's Abbey. He's noted--
Yeah, that's right. Noted for his piety.
A humble soul, he is, with a heart as gentle as a lamb.
-Be easy with him, master.
-Oh, I won't harm him.
You stay here lest you frighten him. Don't interfere.
But that friar's one of the most dangerous swordsmen--
Bless my soul, a miracle!
A robber-thief! Give me back my mutton joint!
If you're a robber you'll get nothing from me.
I'm a curtal friar and vowed to poverty.
If this is poverty, I'll gladly share it with you.
That's what you are doing. Give me back my mutton joint!
Not so close, my ponderous one.
-I'd have a word with you.
-Well?
I live in the forest with good fellows...
... who've everything in life save spiritual guidance.
And no merit but one.
-And what's that?
-We're outlaws.
Since we're newborn to the greenwood, we need someone to do our christenings.
-So we've chosen you.
-Not I.
They've probably all got your taking ways.
Of course. But you'll love them, one and all.
Let's waste no more time.
We'll take the shortcut across the stream.
-Come.
-I'll not. I'm happy here.
You will come.
Now then, since I don't care to get my feet wet...
... you'll carry me across on your back.
-On my back?
-Bend! You must learn obedience.
Come on, bend.
On, now!
Come on! On! On!
Come now, fat one. Why not give up?
You can see I'm a better swordsman.
After I let a little air into your bellows you'll whistle a different tune.
By Our Lady, you're the fairest swordsman I ever met.
Must we go on, then?
I think we're even now, friar.
Even? Nay. You're still ahead of me by half a leg of mutton.
-So--
-No. Hold there, friar. Enough.
come with me and I'll promise you the finest venison pasty...
... andthebiggestyou everate.
Beef, boar's head, casks of ale.
If you'd said that before, you'd have saved us both a wetting.
-You'll join us?
-Aye.
If only to convert you from your thieving ways.
You're Robin Hood, aren't you?
The holy henchman!
Hail, doubting friar!
-Robin.
-Aye?
He's well named Friar Tuck.
It would take half the deer in Sherwood Forest to fill that cavern.
And twice that to fill your empty head.
-Whoa, Will!
-What news, Will?
-I've got word--
-It's all right.
He's one of us.
One of us? He looks like three of us.
Aye. And equal to a full dozen.
Now, now, now, now.
Friar Tuck, Will Scarlett. What's it, Will?
Sir Guy of Gisbourne is stopping by the way tonight.
-Has he got the tax money?
-A fortune!
-When does he enter Sherwood?
-Tomorrow.
We'll have to postpone that stuffing match, but it'll be double tomorrow!
Come! Back to camp, men! Here, curb your appetite with that.
-Are you ready, men?
-Aye.
-See anything of them?
-Not yet.
Is everything ready?
They'll think they've got into a blooming hornet's nest.
There they come.
Hadn't we better send out flanking guards?
What for?
Well, this is Sherwood, you know, and Robin Hood--
-Afraid of that gallows-face?
-Afraid? Certainly not, sir.
But it's here that he's boldest.
Don't worry. We're more than enough to take care of him.
Outlaws have no face to show themselves against armed troops.
Are you sure? I seem to remember--
He jumps out of ambush at small parties, but he wouldn't dare to attack us.
-Well, you old rooster, what do you see?
-Make ready. They're in two sections.
-Do you see Sir Guy?
-He's leading the second.
The treasure wagon is with him.
Sir Guy and the sheriff are watering their horses.
-The advance guard's far ahead.
-Good. Little John!
Take your men and cut off the first section.
You surround the advance guard.
-Ready, men?
-Aye, Robin!
Then stand ready for the signal.
Come, Will. come on, let's welcome Sir Guy.
-Look!
-The guard! Quick!
Welcome to Sherwood, my lady.
What, Sir Guy, no greeting from you? Why, that's curious.
I've often heard that you'd give me a warm welcome if ever we met again.
-You're permitting this without even--?
-Fighting?
-I'm afraid he has no choice, my lady.
-Well, I have, you impudent rascal!
You're not going to harm my lamb, my honeysuckle.
Be still, Bess.
We've nothing but peaceful intentions. Have we, men?
We only want to stroke his pretty neck.
-We won't harm him much.
-You see?
Well, let's away.
Don't bother to mark the way.
It'll take keener men than you've got...
-... tofindourcampagain.
-You'll hang for this, all of you.
A small price to pay for the company of such a charming lady.
What can a Saxon hedge-robber know of charm? Or ladies?
-She means you.
-Me? A hedge-robber?
You must tell me more about myself.
You may have been misinformed.
Perhaps, but I don't find it interesting enough to bother about.
You just harm one hair of my lady's head  andthatuglyfaceofyours willwalk about with no neck under it.
Now, mind!
-What are you staring at?
-I ain't never been out walking...
-... witha femalebefore.
-What female?
-You.
-Well, of all the impudence!
I suppose you say that to all women that tickle your fancy.
I've never tickled a woman's fancy before.
No, I've never had a sweetheart.
Do you mean to say you never had one single sweetheart in all your life?
You don't know what you missed, my lad.
I've had the bands on five times.
My lord! Your robes for the feast. Hurry up, put them on.
-I won't!
-You will!
I will! I will!
To them, this is heaven.
Silks for rags, kindness instead of riches, limitless food instead of hunger.
-Why, they're actually happy.
-Are they?
Aren't you even a little pleased to see them enjoying themselves?
I think it's revolting.
Your life's been very sheltered, hasn't it, my lady?
Too sheltered, perhaps.
But if you could know these people as I know them.
Their patience, loyalty, goodness.
Friar Tuck! These should fit Sir Guy.
Me lord. Here is your raiment for the banquet.
When you've done with them, give them to Prince John.
To the tables, everybody, and stuff yourselves!
May I serve you, my lady?
I'm afraid the company has spoiled my appetite.
Misfortune. Now, mine is excellent.
-A little mutton, my lady?
-I said I'm not hungry.
Why, so you did. I'd forgotten.
Well, you will let me know if you regain your appetite, won't you?
Friends! Friends!
I'd supposed, with you, that this Sir Guy of Gisbourne was a scurvy fellow...
... anda bitterenemyofours . And yet, look!
He provides us with this tasty supper.
And is this the end of his beneficence? Why, no!
For in his train today...
... he's brought us half a score of boxes full of jewels and silks...
... andmore,about30,000goldenmarks  wrested from the northern shires.
-You wouldn't dare.
-Sit down!
Some of you might think our host...
... intendedthistreasure for the coffers of Prince John...
... insteadofto ransomthe king. And you would be right.
But a strange thing happened.
A change of heart overtook him in the forest, and there it is, safe and sound!
-You speak of loyalty.
-Yes. Why not?
I suppose you and your cutthroats intend to send this treasure to Richard?
You wouldn't dream of keeping it yourselves.
Friends! What shall we do with this treasure?
Divide it amongst ourselves?
-Hold it for Richard!
-It belongs to the king!
-Convinced?
-I may have been hasty... .
But why you, a knight...
... shouldliveherelikeananimal, robbing, killing, outlawed... ?
Are you really interested in learning why I turned outlaw?
Or are you afraid of the truth? Or of me, perhaps?
-I'm afraid of nothing. Least of all of you.
-Good. Then come with me.
Oh, so you are afraid.
-Well, men.
-Hi!
Hardly an inspiring sight for such pretty eyes as yours, I'm sure.
But these poor devils have all had their homes burned.
Their families beaten and starved to death by your tax gatherers.
-Bless you. We'll never forget you.
-Our humble thanks, master.
-May we be worthy, Robin.
-You are, mother, you are.
-Have you eaten well, friend?
-Yes, thank you, Robin Hood.
We humbly thank you, master.
I'm sorry to have to show you that.
But once these poor people were happy and contented.
Just simple villagers who never harmed a soul.
And now... .
Tortured,eyesput out , tongues slit, ears hacked off.
They come to me for protection against your Norman friends.
But you've taken Norman lives.
Yes, those that deserved it. The cruel and unjust.
You're a strange man.
Strange? Because I can feel for beaten, helpless people?
No, you're strange because you want to do something about it.
You're willing to defy Sir Guy, even Prince John himself.
To risk your own life.
-And one of those men was a Norman.
-Norman or Saxon. What's that matter?
-It's injustice I hate, not the Normans.
-But it's lost you your rank, your lands.
It's made you a hunted outlaw  whenyoumighthave lived in comfort and security.
What's your reward for all this?
Reward? You just don't understand, do you?
I'm sorry.
I do begin to see a little now.
If you do, then that's reward enough.
Now that you've robbed us and had your fill of insulting us, we wish to leave.
-Come, Lady Marian.
-My men will escort my lady.
But before you leave, it might be well if you thanked her for saving your life.
My life?
Do you think you would have left this forest alive...
... if it hadn't been for her presence here?
-Peter! Harold!
-Yes, master?
Take six men and guide our loyal host and his nervous friend...
-... totheNottinghamRoad.
-But our horses, our clothes.
You'll return to Nottingham as you are, on foot.
This, Sir Guy, will at least be a lesson to you in humility, if not in mercy.
-Your people will be returned tomorrow.
-But the Lady Marian.
You'd best be started before I have a change of mind.
I think we'd better go.
Now, my lady.
Friar Tuck! Little John!
Take the lady to the Abbey of the Black Canons...
... sotomorrowthebishop can give her escort the rest of the way.
-May I go too?
-With your permission, my lady?
Goodbye, my lady.
Goodbye.
-He took everything you had collected?
-Every silver penny.
And you two nincompoops sat there and let him do it.
-Oh, we resisted as well as we could.
-Where are your wounds? Your bruises?
-And where are your men?
-What did Your Highness expect?
With the Lady Marian in our company and Locksley's men outnumbering us.
And not an arrow wound to divide among them, I suppose.
And more than 30,000 marks in the hands of that wolf's head.
That fellow's got to be taken. Understand?
And how does Your Highness suggest that he be taken?
-lf I may be so bold as to inquire?
-Mind your words, Gisbourne.
You're fortunate not to be paying for this with your head.
Your Highness, sir, I could muster an army and surround Sherwood.
-You couldn't capture him...
-You mind your words.
... ifhesatinyour lap shooting arrows at a crow.
Arrows!
-He said shooting arrows at a crow.
-Take that silly looking bonnet off.
That stirs something in my mind.
Perhaps we can't take him by force.
He's too well protected.
Knows Sherwood's hidden paths well. But--
-But what?
-We'll outwit him.
We'll hold an archery tournament!
Archery tour--
And have him fly in on the end of one of his own arrows?
That's marvelous.
He's the finest archer in the North.
Think he'd forgo shooting  againstthearchersofallEngland?
We'll give a prize. Say, a golden arrow.
And ask him to risk his neck for that?
That won't be the only bait, with the Lady Marian presenting the arrow herself.
What do you mean?
When they came out of the forest, she seemed very friendly.
And didn't you notice how his eyes never left her?
-Yes, yes, I noticed.
-Well, then!
-Well, then, how do we get word to him?
-Get word to Robin...
... whohasan eyeineverybush and ears in every wall?
But even if he comes, won't he be disguised?
Whether he be dressed as priest, beggar, knight...
... palmer,whatdisguisecan conceal the finest archer in England?
The man who wins the golden arrow will be Robin Hood.
Will you take that bonnet off?
I hope our little golden hook will catch the fish.
-You hope?
-Oh, it will if he's here.
If he's not, we'll stick your head upon the target and shoot at that.
-Are your men sure of their orders?
-Yes.
They're stationed all around the field.
Even a worm couldn't get through.
You talk as if this were a trap.
No, my dear.
Just a precaution in case the Saxons create a disturbance.
By orders of His Highness Prince John...
... thechampions of Sir Guy and the knights...
... willbelimitedtothreeflights of arrows for the eliminations.
The winning team will meet all comers.
-You know it's a trap.
-A golden arrow, from the lady herself.
-They've cooked this up to take you.
-Well, what of it?
-You know what'll happen if they do.
-Where's your sporting blood?
Sir Guy accepted our invitation. We'd be rude not to accept his.
-It'd be ruder to get your neck stretched.
-There, my band getting fat and overfed.
Where's your love of fights, risk, adventure?
Since our friend seems to have gone a little mad, I'll have to see him through.
We'll have to see him through.
Prepare final flight.
Does my lady find it interesting? Lady Marian?
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-I asked if you found it interesting.
Yes, very. They're splendid archers.
You'll find it much more interesting later on.
The winning team will compete as individuals.
Captain Phillip of Arras.
Elwyn the Welshman. Matt of Sleaford.
They now challenge all comers.
The men who'd shoot against that lot have to have the eyes of a falcon.
They're far too good for me. I'm not shooting today.
Remaining archers will use center target.
Matt of Sleaford, out!
Elwyn the Welshman, out!
-The tall tinker.
-Now is the time.
Not so hasty, Sir Guy. I'm enjoying myself.
Let them finish the match.
-But he could--
-Have your men close in if you wish.
Look.
Yeah, they're closing in. I hope Robin sees them.
I must commend Your Highness for the subtlety of your scheme.
Very good. Would you say you'd seen that tall fellow before?
And if I had, what interest could a tinker have for me?
Phillip of Arras shoots next.
Tie! You will be allowed another flight.
Target's a deal too close. can we have it removed to a fit distance to shoot at?
Another 20 paces!
If your archer captain wins at that distance...
... I'll give you 1 000 gold marks for him.
Win or lose, I'll give him to Your Highness for a favor.
Provided you let me deal with this wolf's head in my own way.
Done.
I'm leaving for Norwich right after the tournament anyway...
... soyoumaydowhat youplease with him.
Why, he can't win now. No living man could beat that shot.
I'll wager 1 00 marks on Phillip of Arras!
He split Phillip's arrow.
The tinker wins! He wins!
-What is your name, archer?
-Godfrey of Sherwood, Your Highness.
How is it that a tinker learned so well the use of arms?
Even a peaceful tinker...
... mustprotecthimselfthesedays  from treachery and other things.
It's earned you more than you bargained for today.
I pronounce you champion archer of England.
From the gracious hand of Lady Marian Fitzwalter, you'll receive your reward.
Advance.
I... .
Hereis yourprize,sirarcher.
It's indeed an honor to receive it from the hands of so beautiful a lady.
-How is it you didn't use a black arrow?
-That's my court of last resort, Sir Guy.
-Its verdict is always final.
-Arrest this man!
That's a good idea.
You're a very rash young man.
And I'm sorry I can't be in Nottingham to see what Gisbourne has in store for you.
-It'll be something special, I'm sure.
-I'm sure.
Sorry I underestimated you. Next time perhaps--
There'll be no next time. Take him away!
"Robin of Locksley. Known to some as the outlaw Robin Hood.
After trial, in which you did not produce one witness in your behalf...
... you've been found guilty of outlawry, theft, murder, abduction...
... falsepretenses, contempt of the Crown...
... poachinginroyalforests and high treason."
Haven't you forgotten a count or two?
Surely it's a crime under the noble Prince John to love one's country.
To protect serfs from injustice and be loyal to one's king.
If I could add anything to the charges against you, I would most gladly do so.
"It is the sentence of this tribunal, that on the morrow at noon you be taken...
... tothesquareinNottinghamandthere hanged by the neck until you are dead."
There may be some who will regret that a man of your peculiar talents...
... shouldbecutoff soearlyinlife. But personally--
You think the sentence extremely lenient. Thank you.
What's troubling you, my lady? Is it the outlaw?
Yes. I hate to see a human being trapped... .
Bess, you know where his men may be found, don't you?
-Why, my lady, how should I know?
-Don't put me off.
That little man who liked you. You've been seeing him?
-Yes, my lady.
-Tell me where.
-Do you want to send a message?
-To his men, yes.
Well, my lady, I have had a nip of ale of a night, just now and again...
... at a place in the town and I won't deny as some of the others were there.
Where was it? Oh, Bess, please tell me!
It was a tavern, my lady.
The Saracen's Head in Pilgrim court.
-The landlord's name is Humility Prin.
-Humility Prin.
Knock at the door and say, "A Locksley."
-"A Locksley."
-Yes, but--
Get me a cloak, quickly!
Yes, madame. Oh, dear... .
-But there must be some way-- -couldn't we storm the place?
Why, you'd need an army with a battering ram to even dent it.
Aye, he'll be hanged for sure.
Maybe Little John's right. Perhaps we should--
A Locksley.
-What is it, Prin?
-A lady, sir. The Lady Marian.
-What?
-It's a trap, Will. Watch those windows.
She has the password, all right.
-Is she alone?
-Yes, sir.
Fetch her in.
-What do you want, my lady?
-I want to help him.
-How did you find us here?
-Never mind that now.
Please don't stand there staring. Tell me what I can do.
-Don't trust her. It's a Norman trick.
-Would I come alone if it were a trap?
What's to prevent your killing me if--?
Is there no one here with sense enough to see?
One moment.
We have to make sure, my child.
You're a good daughter of the church?
You swear by Our Lady that you want to help Robin?
I swear, good Father.
-Have you thought of a way?
-Yes.
-Can you get us in the castle?
-That's no good. He's heavily guarded.
But I thought of another way. Listen.
-This is a rare treat, isn't it, my lady?
-Yes, isn't it?
With Locksley out of the way, we'll stamp out the rest.
Won't it be a pleasant surprise for Prince John when he returns?
To think that I was once foolish enough to believe that you rather liked him.
Why, your hand is trembling.
Take him to the gallows.
Take him up there.
He'll not be so insolent when they've stretched his neck.
Get ready.
Stop him!
Stop! Guards!
Friar Tuck! Much!
-Here we are, sir!
-Here we are, safe and sound!
Back to camp!
Robin! Where are you?
Here I am. Stand by!
He is different from anyone I've ever known.
He's, well, he's brave and he's reckless, and yet he's gentle and kind.
He's not brutal like... .
Tell me, when you are in love, is it...
... well,isit hardtothinkofanybody but one person?
Yes, indeed, and sometimes there's a bit of trouble sleeping.
I know, but it's a nice kind of not sleeping.
Yes, and it affects your appetite too.
Not that I've noticed it's done that to you  exceptwhenhe was waiting to be hanged.
Does it make you want to be with him all the time?
Yes. And when he's with you, your legs are weak as water.
Tell me, my lady, when he looks at you, do you feel a kind of prickly feeling...
... likegoosypimplesrunning all up and down your spine?
-Then there's not a doubt of it.
-Doubt of what?
That you're in love!
What do you want?
Robin!
-I must say. I must say!
-Keep quiet, Bess.
Are you completely mad?
-Why did you come here?
-To see you.
But don't you realize that--?
My men told me what you did for me, so I've come to thank you.
And after what I couldn't help overhearing about that prickly feeling...
... I'm very glad I did come.
That was a game. Now, you've got to go at once!
A game? Well, couldn't I join in?
Of course, I probably wouldn't be as good at it as this pretty young girl.
But I could do my best.
Bess, will you leave us?
Please!
Now, let's see, where does this game begin?
Oh, I know. It's simple.
We'll start where you're in love with me.
You are, aren't you? Because I am with you, terribly.
That's why I came. I had to see you again.
You must go at once. And I don't love you.
-Oh! Are you sure?
-Yes.
Very well then, I'll go.
This is rather unfriendly of you, exposing me to my enemies like this.
Let me see.
There's a fat old captain of the guard down there with bow legs.
If I drop on him that'll bend them out worse.
An archer! He's too thin. I might miss him altogether.
-Robin!
-The very thing.
Five men-at-arms in a group.
They'll break the fall beautifully.
-Goodbye, my lady!
-Robin!
-Yes?
-Please.
Then you do love me? Don't you?
-Don't you?
-You know I do.
Well, that's different.
-Do you know you're very impudent?
-Me?
You are!
When my guardian, King Richard, finds out about your being in love with me--
-I know, he'll make me court jester.
-He won't!
He'll stick your funny head on London Gate.
And a fine decoration it will be, my bold Norman beauty.
-I'm not bold.
-Well, you're Norman.
Well, I don't hold that against you. And you are a beauty.
-You're the most beautiful--
-You're leaving at once.
Please, darling, every minute you're here you're in danger.
I'll go.
-Marian, will you come with me?
-To Sherwood?
I've nothing to offer you but a life of hardship and danger...
... but we'd be together.
-But, Robin, dear--
-It's asking a lot, but who knows  how long it'll be before Richard returns.
Friar Tuck could marry us. Will you?
Because I love you, Robin, I'd come.
Even the danger would mean nothing if you were with me.
Then you will?
No. Listen to me, darling.
You remember that day in Sherwood Forest?
I realized then for the first time that what you were doing was right...
... andthatwe werewrong.
No, let me finish.
You taught me England is bigger than Normans and Saxons...
... fightingandhatingeachother.
That it belongs to all of us, to live peacefully together...
... Ioyalonlyto Richardand toEngland.
But, darling, you could help.
I could help much more by watching for treachery here...
... andleavingyoufreetoprotect Richard's people until he returns.
Now do you see why you have to go back to your men alone?
Go now, quickly, dearest.
-Goodbye, darling.
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, my love.
-Goodbye.
-You gentlemen have traveled far?
-Yes, quite a distance.
I'm sorry I can't give you better food.
-There is little left to us these days.
-This will be enough.
The inn at Luton was well supplied. How is that?
That's a Norman inn.
But it's an outrage! I'll complain to Prince John.
I'll have this rascal's ears, no matter how.
Dares to rob me!
Strip my person of jewels!
What's this country coming to  whena highchurchman can't travel the forest in safety?
-Who's he?
-The Bishop of the Black Canons.
-Do you wish to go on after dinner?
-No. We can't reach the abbey tonight.
-I'll stay. Tend to the horses.
-Yes, Your Grace.
-Bring food to us!
-Yes, Your Grace, at once!
It's no longer safe to journey anywhere.
Robbers at every turn of the road.
-What happened, Your Grace?
-I told you! We've been robbed.
Not a chance to defend ourselves.
They burst on us from ambush.
-Who did?
-Why, Robin Hood, of course.
There's no other with impudence enough.
Robin Hood again, sire.
-You've heard of him, then?
-Oh, he seems well known hereabouts.
-Oh, then you're strange to this shire?
-More or less.
What might be your names, gentlemen?
We're hardly important enough to deserve your interest.
-Landlord, where's our ale?
-Coming, sirs.
Will you gentlemen be remaining here tonight?
We hadn't decided, Your Grace. What would you advise?
Well, there's so much danger on the road, you'd be far safer here.
We will then, since we'll have the added pleasure of your company.
I should like to stay, but I recollected some urgent affairs at my abbey.
Some other time, or perhaps you would break your journey...
-... andsupwithmetomorrow.
-Your Grace is too kind.
Then I bid you good evening, gentlemen, and God speed you in the morning.
Thank you. Good night.
The window!
Are there beds prepared, landlord?
Let's to sleep, then. I'm tired.
-I'm afraid he suspects, sire.
-I fear so.
His Grace is a Norman.
Did you see the fear on the landlord's face when he came in?
I've seen it in the faces of thousands since we returned.
I ought never to have left England.
I noticed when Robin Hood's name is mentioned--
The mysterious outlaw whom we have sought.
In vain.
However, the bishop didn't have any difficulty meeting him.
Which gives me an idea.
-And you're sure it was Richard?
-No doubt of it.
How like my dear brother this is!
He couldn't rot in Durnstein like any decent man.
-But Richard has no army.
-No, Your Highness.
-lf he had, we should have heard of it.
-lf my brother happened to be killed--
-England would have a new king.
-That would be murder! I'll have no part--
You'll do as you're told! That's very simple.
Keep your mouth closed.
Your Highness, I beg of you!
How long will you retain your abbey if Richard survives to find out...
... what you've been up to these years he's been away?
Go on, Gisbourne. Who's to... ?
Dickon was a knight before your brother hacked off his spurs...
... oversomelittlemischance.
There's nothing he wouldn't do for a king who'd restore him to rank.
-You don't love my brother, I hear.
-I have little reason to, Your Highness.
-You know this tavern?
-Yes.
If Richard dies--
Dickon returns to the roll of English knights.
Am I not right?
With the manor and estate of Robin of Locksley to support his rank.
-When shall I start? -Now.
How many men will you need?
I shall do it better alone, Your Highness.
The sooner you're crowned king--
The better for my friends? You're a clever fellow, Gisbourne.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Return to your abbey and make preparations to proclaim me king...
... hereinNottingham, the day after tomorrow.
Do you suppose she heard?
I don't know.
Now you know why Robin's got to find King Richard at once and warn him.
Take this note to Much at Saracen's Head.
My lady's hearing is a little defective tonight.
When you knock at a lady's door as if it were a tavern, you deserve to wait.
You seem upset.
Upset? Why should I be?
Oh, come now, my dear Lady Marian.
You've played the innocent long enough.
-Let's be frank with one another.
-I don't see the need.
You're charming, but not exactly clever.
You couldn't have failed  tooverhearwhatPrinceJohn  and I were talking about.
Oh, no, no, no. Please don't trouble to deny it.
And your first thought, as Richard's loyal ward, was to warn him.
-Am I not right?
-Why, how could I warn Richard?
How did Locksley and his men arrange his escape...
... fromhangingafterthe archerymatch?
Someone here in the castle must have got word to him.
That's ridiculous!
When Richard's in danger, what more natural...
... thanthatyoushouldtry to warn him through Locksley?
And you do intend to warn him, don't you?
-Don't you?
-No!
If that's true, perhaps you'd explain before Prince John  andtheCourtofExecution the meaning of this.
Guard!
Escort my Lady Marian to the Great Hall.
Not only has she consorted with this Saxon rebel...
... foundguiltyof outlawry,theft, murder, abduction and high treason...
... butshehasbetrayed her own Norman people.
Are you not ashamed, my Lady Marian?
Yes, I am. Bitterly.
But it's a shame that I'm a Norman  afterseeingthethingsmyfellow countrymen have done to England.
At first I wouldn't believe.
Because I was a Norman I wouldn't let myself believe  thatthehorrorsyou inflicted on the Saxons weren't just.
I know now why you tried so hard to kill this outlaw whom you despised.
It's because he was the one man in England who protected the helpless...
... againstbeasts who were drunk on human blood!
And now you intend to murder your own brother!
You'll be sorry you interfered.
Sorry? I'd do it again if you kill me for it.
A prophetic speech, my lady, for that is exactly what is going to happen to you.
You wouldn't dare.
I'm the royal ward of King Richard and no one but the king himself...
... hastherighttocondemnmetodeath.
You are quite right, my dear.
And it shall be a king who will order your execution for high treason...
... exactly48hoursfromnow.
Take her away.
-You got it all in your stupid head now?
-Of course I have.
Well, give Robin the whole message exactly like I told it to you.
Bess, where was Dickon supposed to find King Richard?
Oh, never mind him!
What do I care about your kings and thrones and such?
Robin has gotta do something to save my baby!
Come on, old girl. Robin will look after her, all right.
-Where's Dickon heading for?
-Kent Road Tavern.
Kent Road Tavern?
You can save three miles and cut him off through Low Wood.
Come on, lass, give us a kiss and wish me luck.
Hurry up and take your ugly face out of here.
Oh, Much. Oh, you will be careful, won't you?
Of course I will.
Greetings, sir abbot!
-You've traveled far this morning?
-Too far to be patient with delay now.
Perhaps it's the weight of your purse that wearies you.
I can remedy that.
If it weighs more than a just amount I'll share it with those who have less.
You think I hand my purse to every rough lout who asks for it?
You see, sir abbot?
We're poor outlaws, with nothing to eat but the king's deer  whileyouhaveproperty, rents, and silver.
I've traveled far on the king's business and the silver I have left...
... equalsnomorethan60marks .
What? Are you friendly to our good King Richard?
I love no man better.
By that speech you save half your money.
Give me 30 marks for the poor and the rest you may keep.
Then I can go free?
Any friend of Richard's is free of this forest.
Would you honor us by sharing meat with us?
-Gladly.
-Then come.
-Well, sir rascal, tell me, who are you?
-I'm called Robin Hood.
It seems I've heard of you.
-Nothing good, I hope.
-Oh, now I remember!
How does your loyalty to Richard set on a killer of knights...
... a poacher of the king's deer and an outlaw?
Those I kill died from misusing the trust that Richard left them.
And the worst rogue of these is the king's own brother.
-Oh, then you blame Prince John.
-No, I blame Richard.
His task was defending his people...
... insteadofdesertingthem to fight in foreign lands.
What? You'd condemn Holy crusades?
I'll condemn anything that leaves the task of holding England...
Much!
-Much, what's happened to you?
-Take me to Robin, quick!
-Much, what's happened?
-King Richard's in England. In Sherwood!
What?
Prince John sent Dickon to Kent Road Tavern last night to kill the king.
-Take 50 men to the Kent Road Tavern--
-No need, master, no need.
I headed Dickon off. He ain't gonna murder no one no more.
-But the king? Where is he?
-I don't know, master.
Men, Richard must be found.
He must be brought here for safety.
Little John, take a party and scour the country.
Friar Tuck, into the town.
Will, search every inn and cottage.
Don't rest, day or night, until he's found.
Understand?
You don't need to search for Richard, Robin.
-He's in good hands. The best in England.
-What do you mean? Where is he?
Here!
Sire.
All these have remained loyal.
Rise, Sir Robin.
Rise, men of Sherwood.
Sire, Prince John's calling Bishop of the Black Canons...
... toproclaimhimking in Nottingham tomorrow.
-How'd you learn this?
-Lady Marian. She overheard.
They've taken her for treason.
She's been condemned to the block for warning us.
He wouldn't dare execute the king's ward.
You underestimate him.
If we're to save her and your throne, we've got to act now!
By attacking Nottingham castle?
Without an army it'll be much too strong.
Your men will be killed.
If the Bishop of the Black Canons is performing the ceremony tomorrow...
... supposewevisithim  at his abbey tonight... ... andpersuadehimtosuggestaway.
Brace up. Smile!
Wider!
Still sure it wasn't you who warned my brother I was in England?
Why, sire, believe me, l--
Your Grace, smile!
You'll sweat the lard off that fat carcass of yours...
... before this day's over, my pudgy friend.
And I hope some Norman sword whittles you down to size!
Oh, Lord, we beseech thee.
Sanctify this thy servant, our royal Prince John.
Enrich his noble heart and bestow upon him all princely virtues.
Amen.
No news of Richard.
No. None, Your Highness.
Then Dickon must have--
Sir Dickon, Your Highness.
Of course. Of course.
We are ready for the ceremony, Your Majesty.
Remember.
By what authority do you, John Lackland, Prince of England...
... claimtobe crownedthisday,  sovereign of the realm...
... andasdefenderoftheHolySepulcher, to receive the blessing of the church?
By right of blood succession. According to the law of the realm.
Is it of your own free will that you thus depose your brother...
... RichardtheLion-HeartofEngland?
Richard no longer exists!
From this moment forward, I, John, am king of England!
Aren't you a little premature, brother?
Richard! The Lion-Heart!
He's lying! He's an imposter!
-The king lives!
-Men of Sherwood!
Robin Hood!
It's a trick of the outlaws! Kill him! Seize him!
Did I upset your plans?
You've come to Nottingham once too often!
When this is over, there'll be no need for me to come again.
Your sword, Gisbourne.
-Know any prayers, my friend?
-I'll say one for you!
Save yourself, Robin!
The door, quick! Quick, or I'll trim that beard for you!
But, Richard, Richard! I thought--
-You thought I was murdered!
-Oh, no, no.
I didn't mean to... .
After all, Richard, I am your brother.
Yes, sire, he is your brother.
Yes, my brother.
I could forgive you if your treachery were against me and not my subjects.
I banish you and your followers from England for the remainder of my lifetime.
Take them away. See that they leave England.
I further banish from my realm all injustices and oppressions...
... whichhaveburdenedmypeople.
And I pray that under my rule...
... NormansandSaxonsalike will share the rights of Englishmen.
Long live Richard the Lion-Heart!
What about you, Robin?
My sword is yours, sire, now and always.
Is there nothing the king can grant the outlaw...
... whoshowedhim his duty to his country?
Yes, Your Majesty, a pardon for the men of Sherwood.
Granted with all my heart.
Long live Richard the Lion-Heart!
But is there nothing for yourself?
There's but one thing else, sire.
And do you too wish... ?
More than anything in the world, sire.
Kneel, Robin Hood.
Arise, Robin, Baron of Locksley, Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham...
... andlordof allthe landsandmanors appertaining thereto.
My first command to you, my lord earl...
... istotakeinmarriage the hand of the Lady Marian.
Long live Robin Hood! Long live Robin Hood!
Long live Lady Marian!
And what say you to that, Baron of Locksley?
May I obey all your commands with equal pleasure, sire!
Good morning, Miss Swallow.
- Why, what's the matter?
- Dr. Huxley is thinking.
Alice, I think this one must belong in the tail.
Nonsense.
You tried it in the tail yesterday and it didn't fit.
Yes, that's right. I did, didn't I?
David, it's a telegram for you from Utah. It's from the expedition.
The expedition! Open it. I'll be right down.
David, they found it! They found it, David!
Not the intercostal clavicle?
It's on its way. It'll be here tomorrow.
Just think of it, Professor.
The very last bone we needed to complete the brontosaurus.
The intercostal clavicle is arriving tomorrow after four years' hard work.
- Congratulations, my boy.
- Isn't it great?
I can hardly believe it!
Stop it. Really, David, there's a time and place for everything.
What will Prof. LaTouche think?
After all, you're getting married tomorrow.
- Yes, I know we are...
- Right, we're getting married tomorrow.
Isn't that odd? Two important things happening on the same day.
I think the occasion calls for a celebration.
Don't worry, we'll celebrate.
We're going away directly after we're married.
Going away?
What are you thinking of, David?
After receiving this telegram?
As soon as we're married, we're coming directly back here...
- and you're going on with your work.
- Alice. Now, once and for all, David, nothing must interfere with your work.
Our marriage must entail no domestic entanglements of any kind.
- You mean...
- I mean of any kind, David.
Alice, I was sort of hoping...
You mean children, all that sort of thing?
Exactly. This will be our child.
Yes, David, I see our marriage purely as a dedication to your work.
Alice, everybody has to have a honeymoon and...
We haven't time.
You have an appointment this afternoon.
- Have I?
What for?
- To play golf with Mr. Peabody.
What Peabody?
The Alexander Peabody who represents Mrs. Carleton Random.
Now let me think.
Who may donate $1 million to the museum to complete all this.
Oh, sure! That Mr. Peabody.
$1 million. That's pretty white of Mr. Peabody.
You haven't got it yet.
Let me remind you that a lot depends on the impression you make on him.
Don't worry. After I've received this, I feel good for anything.
I'll wow him, I'll knock him for a loop.
David, no slang. Remember who and what you are.
- That's right.
- Go on. You mustn't keep him waiting.
- Goodbye, Alice.
I mean, Professor. - Don't forget your golf clubs.
Remember, let Mr. Peabody win.
Yes, Alice.
I will. Oh, dear. Excuse me.
I can't tell you, Mr. Peabody... how much this endowment would mean to the museum... and to me personally.
If you could just give me some assurance...
If you could give me some assurance that you'd... consider us first before you donate that million to anyone else, I'd appreciate it.
Dr. Huxley, you seem to be under some misapprehension.
I haven't got $1 million.
I represent the possible donor, Mrs. Carleton Random... whose legal advisor I happen to be.
Yes, of course. I forgot.
Mr. Peabody, then I wonder... if you could use your influence with Mrs. Random, that would be nice.
Dr. Huxley, when I play golf, I only talk golf...
- and then only between shots.
- Yes, of course.
I'm sorry. Couldn't we continue this discussion over a whisky and soda after our game?
Yes, we could.
Meantime, I believe you hooked your ball.
Yes, I did.
I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody.
Yes. All right.
Look! You can't...
That's my ball. Just a minute!
Here's hoping.
I say, just a minute. I beg your pardon.
Oh, dear.
- You shouldn't do that, you know.
- What shouldn't I do?
Talk while someone's shooting.
Anyway, I forgive you because I got a good shot.
- You don't understand.
- It's right next to the pin.
That has nothing to do with it.
- You playing through?
- I've just teed off.
You must be a stranger here. You should be over there.
This is the 18th fairway and I'm on the green. If I sink this, I'll beat my record.
Be there in a minute!
What kind of ball are you playing?
- PGA.
- I'm playing a CrowFlight.
I like a PGA better.
I'm trying to prove that you're playing my ball.
A PGA has two black dots, and a CrowFlight has a circle.
I'm not superstitious.
- That has nothing to do with it.
- Stop talking and take out the pin.
Oh, my, this is so silly.
See?
It's a circle.
Of course. Do you think it would roll if it were square?
I have reference to a mark on the ball. That proves it's a CrowFlight. That's mine.
What does it matter? It's only a game, anyway.
Young lady, you don't seem to realize... you've placed me in a very embarrassing position.
Really?
I'm sorry.
The most important lawyer in New York is waiting for me on the first fairway.
Then it's silly of you to be fooling around on the 18th green.
You don't mind if I take this with me?
Not at all.
Tell the caddy master to put it in my bag when you're finished.
Huxley, come on!
Yes, I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody!
Hey, mister, I think that's your car.
I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody!
What do you think you're doing?
I'm trying to un-park my car.
- Oh, hello.
- This is my car!
Good. Would you mind moving it out of the way?
- No. This is my car.
- Yes, I understand that.
If you move it back four feet, I'll be able to get out.
I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
Maybe this is yours. What did you say?
I said if you move it back about four feet, I'll be able to get out.
I'm in a terrible hurry, and I can't budge.
- You want me to move your car?
- Would you mind terribly?
- Yes, I will, but...
- That would be awfully kind.
- Take it very easy.
- Yes, I'll go slowly.
What are you doing?
I have to get into position.
Please be careful.
I will. Now, you say when.
- Yes, all right.
- Am I clear?
Yes, you're clear now.
- Now look what you've done.
- That's all right. I'm insured.
I don't care whether you're insured or not!
Let me drive this car.
It's all right. It's an old wreck, anyway. It doesn't matter.
You don't understand. This is my car!
- You mean this is your car?
- Of course.
Your golf ball, your car?
Is there anything in the world that doesn't belong to you?
Yes, thank heaven.
You! Now, don't lose your temper.
Young lady, I'm not losing my temper. I'm merely trying to play some golf.
You choose the funniest places. This is a parking lot.
Will you get out of my car?
- Get off my running board.
- This is my running board!
All right, honey, stay there.
Help me!
Don't think everything in the world is yours.
This is my car, I'll handle it.
If you want to come with me, go ahead.
I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody!
Good evening, sir.
I'm looking for Mr. Alexander Peabody. I believe he's dining here.
Mr. Peabody has not arrived yet.
Is that so?
Well, I'll just wait.
- Yes, sir.
- Good evening, Louis.
- Good evening, Mr. Brown. Right this way.
- Thank you.
May I check your hat, sir?
- Excuse me?
- Check your hat?
No, I better...
Maybe you'd...
I'm sorry.
Look at that. I dropped my hat. I'd better hang on to it.
- Now, watch very carefully.
- I'm watching.
I take an olive, I throw it in that glass, but there it is.
- Now I throw it in that one.
- Wait. Now, without the...
Go on.
Watch.
I know what happens. That's wonderful. You take three, don't you?
Only you cheated. You can see me take three.
You throw it in the glass. Take another one, throw it.
- Good!
- And then you do this.
I'm so sorry. Oh, hello.
You're sitting on your hat.
- I know it.
- That's silly. Get up. I'm awfully sorry.
I couldn't be more apologetic, really.
Well, I might have known you were here.
I had a feeling just as I hit the floor.
That was your hat.
Look at it. Look.
Yes, it's too bad, isn't it?
Joe here was showing me a trick, and the olive got away.
First you drop an olive, then I sit on my hat.
It all fits perfectly.
You can't do that trick without dropping some of the olives.
It takes practice.
What, to sit on my hat?
No, to drop an olive.
Now, if you're going to be angry with me, what can I do?
Go away.
No. I was here first.
- Then I'll go away.
- What, you...
Won't you just take the olive dish?
No, it's all right. I'll sit here. You don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.
- This is rather difficult.
- I guess it is.
- Goodness.
Your face is familiar. Haven't we met somewhere?
Not to my knowledge.
You're wrong. My name's Susan Vance.
I'm Dr. Fritz Lehman.
That's all right. You can sit down. I don't mind at all.
- You may have heard me lecture.
- What do you lecture about?
I usually talk about nervous disorders. I am a psychiatrist.
Oh, crazy people.
We dislike the use of that word.
All people who behave strangely are not insane.
Is that so?
Would you mind if I asked your professional opinion about something?
Not at all.
What would you say about a man who follows a girl around... and then when she talks to him, he fights with her?
Fights with her?
Is the young man your fiancé?
No. I don't know, I never even saw him before today.
No, he just follows me around and fights with me.
The love impulse in man very frequently reveals itself in terms of conflict.
The love impulse?
Without my knowing anything about it... my rough guess would be that he has a fixation on you.
A fixation... Wait a minute, I can't remember more than that. A fixation?
"The love impulse in man frequently reveals itself in terms of conflict."
- That's right.
- I'm eternally grateful to you.
You're absolutely wonderful. Thank you very much.
Do you know why you're following me?
You're a fixation.
I'm not following you. I haven't moved from this spot.
Please, you're following me.
Don't be absurd. Who's always behind whom?
My dear young lady, I haven't been behind anything... but what they call the eight ball.
I haven't been all day. - You're angry, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.
The love impulse in man frequently reveals itself in terms of conflict.
- Excuse me. The what impulse?
- Love impulse.
The trouble with you is that you have a...
Look, all I'm trying to do... is find the gentleman whom, thanks to you...
I abandoned on the golf course today. That's all.
Now please go...
Say, this isn't...
Where do you suppose I...
- Hold this a minute. I'll be right back.
- Yes.
Missed.
- I'm sorry I was so long.
- It's quite all right.
I had a very entertaining conversation with a young lady who does tricks... with olives when she gets it right.
Fritz, where's my purse?
I thought you had it with you.
No, I left it right here on the table.
- My diamond pin was in it.
- Your diamond pin?
You just lost a diamond pin. We're going to find it, all right?
- Don't worry about it.
Why, there it is. Thank you very much. It's very kind of you.
- Thank you.
- Why, no.
This is my purse. My diamond pin is in it.
- Will you please...
- No, I'm afraid...
- Give me that.
- Will you please hand it over?
- Do something about it.
- Keep out of it, darling.
- I did the trick.
- You did?
Good.
It is madness for you to say it's not my wife's.
You've made a slight blunder.
This belongs...
There is the young lady. Isn't this your purse?
- No, this is my purse.
- There you are. Hand it over.
Just a minute. Didn't you give me this purse to hold?
Yes, that's right, I did. I gave him the purse to hold.
There's been a mistake. I lost my purse.
I must've picked up your wife's purse by mistake.
I wanted him to stay here, so I gave him this purse... while I went to find mine.
I was coming back. - Now, that's all perfectly clear, isn't it?
- No, it isn't.
- She's going to give me an explanation.
- No! My dear sir, it never will be clear as long as she's explaining it.
- Now please let me go.
- Just a minute.
He's innocent.
Now you have your wife's purse, I have my purse... and Louie will explain it all to you and everything will be all right.
Please listen. You can't think I did that intentionally.
If I could think, I'd have run when I saw you.
If you'd only let me explain. I just gave you my purse to...
You've torn your coat.
Now, I didn't do it on purpose. That's not right. It's not my fault.
I did it, but I didn't mean to do it. I just caught hold of your coat.
Will you do something for me?
A needle?
No, it's simpler than that. Let's play a game.
What?
Watch. I'll put my hand over my eyes, and then you go away. See?
Then I'll count to 10, and when I take my hand down... you will be gone.
One...
I like that. I was only trying to be nice.
Thank you.
Just a minute!
You can't talk to me that way then crawl out of it.
- When I'm mad, I'm mad.
- Something horrible has happened.
Don't tell me about it. Just get out of it as best you can.
Please stop following me around, fixation or no fixation. I've had enough.
- Stop talking, so I can tell you...
- Will you stop crowding me?
- I'm just trying to tell you, you've torn...
- No, I didn't.
- Lf you'd waited for my explanation...
- Not my coat your coat would still be very all right.
- What is the matter with you?
- You see, I...
Do you realize you're making a fool out of yourself?
You can't tell me I tore your coat. There's such a thing as being fair.
Will you please stop doing that with your hat?
Just stand there, will you?
What in the world is going on?
- No! Please don't move!
- I've had enough of this.
Listen to me. Let's get out of here. Just start walking.
So now you want to walk.
Well, I'm quite sure that I don't want to walk with you.
I hope you realize that you've made a perfect spectacle of yourself.
Have you finished?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
Don't just stand there. Do something.
Oh, my goodness. Get behind me.
- I am behind you.
- Get closer.
I can't get any closer. Are you ready?
Be calm. Left foot first.
- Go straight out the door.
- I have to meet someone here. There he is.
Don't you dare leave me.
I'll be with you in a minute, sir.
It's very important that I meet this man to explain to him what happened... although if I saw him, I wouldn't know what to say.
It's perfectly simple.
Tell him you met someone you knew and were detained.
I can picture myself explaining our exit from the Ritz Plaza to Mr. Peabody.
It's not Boopie that you're trying to see?
No. His name's Peabody.
Alexander Peabody. But that's Boopie, and I know him well.
I was going to have supper with him tonight. He'll do anything I ask.
- Let's go to the Ritz and catch him.
- I'd better go there alone.
If we miss him there, we'll go out to Riverdale. There you are.
- I couldn't spend that much time.
- Riverdale's only half an hour away.
Yes, but I have to go to Carnegie Hall to meet Miss Swallow.
- Miss Swallow?
- Yes. I'm engaged to Miss Swallow.
Engaged to be married?
- That's right.
- That's nice.
- Then she won't mind waiting, will she?
- I wouldn't like to...
If I were engaged to you, I wouldn't mind waiting at all.
- I'd wait for ever.
- But it wouldn't be right.
- I finally got you here, didn't I?
- Yes.
Susan, do they build all the houses in Riverdale alike?
I don't think so. Why?
Because if they don't, we've passed this one six times in the last hour.
But it was such a lovely night for a drive. Come on.
Oh, dear.
There aren't any lights. Mr. Peabody must have gone to bed.
No, he couldn't have gone to bed this soon. It's early.
If they expected you, they could, with the covers over their heads.
If you don't stop nagging, I won't help you arrange matters with Boopie.
I've a feeling it might be better if you didn't.
- Why?
- I don't think we ought to do this, Susan.
If we wake him up, he'll be irritable.
I don't think it's gonna work, but I know where Boopie sleeps.
You can't climb in a man's bedroom window.
I know. It's on the second floor.
Please, it's too late now. You can't wake him up.
Can't I?
What are you doing?
- Pebbles.
- What for?
If you throw pebbles against a window, people think it's hail... and then they come and close the window.
I know we ought to go now, but somehow I can't move.
I guess they weren't big enough.
Why not...
What?
- Here's a pip.
- Just a minute!
Jeepers! Let's get out of here.
Don't worry, everything's going to be all right.
Tomorrow, when Boopie's calmed down, we'll go and see him together.
Now, just a moment. Don't think that I don't appreciate all you've done...
It was nothing, David...
Just a moment. But there are limits to what a man can bear.
Besides, tomorrow afternoon I'm going to get married.
What for?
Because...
Anyway, I'm going to get married, and don't interrupt.
Now, my future wife has always regarded me as a man of some dignity.
Privately, I'm convinced that I have some dignity.
Now, it isn't that I don't like you, Susan... because after all, in moments of quiet, I'm strangely drawn towards you... but there haven't been any quiet moments.
Our relationship has been a series of misadventures... from beginning to end.
So if you don't mind, I'll see Mr. Peabody alone and unarmed.
Without me?
Yes, without you, and definitely without you.
Now, Susan, I'm going to say goodnight.
And I hope that I never set eyes on you again. Goodnight.
Yes, I did see Mr. Peabody, but I didn't see him.
That is, I didn't see him really.
Yes, I spoke to him twice, but I didn't talk to him.
But I don't understand. Did you see him or didn't you?
No, I don't know.
How do I know?
Because...
There's someone at the door.
You see, there are some things that are very hard to explain, Alice... and as soon as I...
Yes, Alice.
Now, Alice, before we're married this afternoon... there's one thing we must have clear.
I don't want any woman interfering with my affairs. It's fatal.
That's the stuff, buddy.
- What do you want?
- Dr. Huxley?
Sign here.
Just a minute, Alice. I have to sign something.
Alice, it's arrived!
The intercostal clavicle. Yes, isn't that wonderful?
Isn't that a marvelous wedding present?
Thank you.
You see, I'm going to be married this afternoon.
Don't let it throw you, buddy.
Yes, Alice. Yes, isn't it great?
Alice, I'm so excited.
I'll tell you what you do.
You go on down to the museum... and I'll meet you there right away. Goodbye.
Hello. Oh, it's you.
I can't hear very well. Come closer to the telephone.
I said, "Good morning, David." Do you want a leopard?
Why should I want a leopard?
For that matter, why should I?
But I've got one.
- Where would you get a leopard?
- I wouldn't get a leopard.
My brother Mark got him. He's hunting in Brazil and he caught him.
Of course. It's a stuffed leopard.
Why should my brother be hunting stuffed leopards in Brazil... when he can find them right here in New York?
David, it's lucky I met you yesterday, because you're the only zoologist I know.
Of course I know what a zoologist is.
Get out of here. No, not you, David.
Baby, get back into that bathroom. You're making a nuisance of yourself.
No, not you, David. No, I want you to come right over.
David, don't be irrelevant. The point is, I have a leopard.
The question is, what am I going to do with it?
Susan, I regret to say the leopard is your problem.
You mean you refuse to help me?
David, you can't do that.
You can't leave me alone with a leopard. I'll come and get you in my...
Susan! What happened?
Is it the leopard?
No. Nothing happened to me, David, I just...
I mean, the leopard!
David, the leopard!
Can you hear me, Susan?
Susan, be brave! I'll be right there!
Hold on there, Susan! Susan! Can you hear me?
I'll be there, Susan!
- You're all right.
- Yes, I'm all right.
- You lied to me!
- No. Just a little.
Telling me a ridiculous story about a leopard.
- I have a leopard. Right in there.
- Where is it?
- I don't believe you.
- But you have to believe me.
I've been the victim of your unbridled imagination once more.
Chasing all the way...
That'll teach you to go around saying things about people.
You've got to get out of this apartment.
But I can't. I have a lease.
You've got to get that thing out of here.
Don't worry, he's all right. What are you gonna do?
- Call the zoo.
- You can't!
That's the meanest thing I ever heard. He's a pet, he'd be miserable in a zoo.
Listen. From my brother Mark:
"Dear Susan, I'm sending you Baby." That's Baby.
"Guard him with your life.
"He's three years old, gentle, and he likes dogs."
I don't know whether that means he eats dogs or is fond of them. Mark's so vague.
"He also likes that song, I Can't Gie You Anything but Loe, Baby."
- That's absurd!
- No, it isn't, really. Listen.
This is probably the silliest thing that ever happened to me.
It's silly but true. He absolutely adores the tune.
What's the difference?
It's silly that he likes such an old tune. I imagine that down in Brazil...
- Stop this, Susan.
- Let me show him to you.
Don't go near the door! Dear, dear.
Watch, David. He'll go right toward the music.
Look at that. Isn't this remarkable?
It loves it, David.
If we put the Victrola in the bathroom, will it go back in?
Yes, but the music sounds better out here. Besides, he likes it.
Here it comes.
Now go away! Please go away!
I'm gonna get out of here.
Susan, I don't like leopards.
- Just think of him as a house cat.
- I don't like cats either.
- Stand still. Don't be nervous.
- Make him stand still!
Don't be silly. You can't make a leopard stand still.
Do something. Turn off that Victrola.
I don't think it's the music. I think it's you.
I think you've found a real friend. Isn't it affectionate, like a baby kitten?
I never saw anything take such a liking to anyone. It'd follow you anywhere.
We'll have no trouble taking it to Connecticut.
My farm in Westlake, Connecticut.
I'm not going to Westlake, Connecticut.
I will not be involved in any more harebrained schemes.
Imagine Aunt Elizabeth coming here and running smack into a leopard.
That would be an end to my $1 million.
If you had an aunt who was going to give you $1 million and she found a leopard...
- in your apartment, what would you do?
- I don't know.
You have to help me.
There are only two things I have to do, finish my brontosaurus and get married.
Go on, quitter.
It's no good calling me names, because I won't argue with you anymore.
I don't want anything to do with a leopard.
Go on, Baby, down the stairs.
Good morning.
- Good morning, Professor.
- Good morning.
You'd better change your mind about coming to Connecticut.
Susan, we settled that question once and for all.
But what about my leopard?
That's your problem.
It's not all my problem.
Susan, will you please go away?
All right. Since he likes you so much, I've decided to give him to you.
I won't take him.
You've got him.
Don't go away! I've got the leopard!
Oh, dear, look at that.
No, David, all I was doing was driving along.
You were standing on the sidewalk yelling, and looking very silly.
You know very well you tricked me into this trip.
Look. Eating your car.
Look at the road!
I have a feeling something horrible is going to happen.
Everything's going to be all right.
I don't care anymore.
Hello. What's the matter, did you get lonely?
Susan, if you know any shortcuts, please take them.
We'll be there in no time.
I just want to deliver this leopard, take the first train back to town... and forget the last 24 hours ever happened.
Now, what's wrong with the last 24 hours?
I've had a wonderful time.
Susan, I don't know. You look at everything upside down.
I've never known anyone quite like you.
You've just had a bad day, that's all.
That's a masterpiece of understatement.
Look, I can't discuss anything with you... with Baby breathing down the back of my neck.
Get down. Go on. Now lie down.
Susan, duck!
Never hang on to a leopard's tail!
Sing, David!
Anyway, I still insist that he was right in the middle of the road.
I've never hit anything that was in the right place.
That wagon was on the side of the road.
It was straight ahead of me. That's why I hit it.
- What time is it?
- We'll be there in no time.
We just have to stop at Westlake and get some meat for Baby.
Why, he's already had an assortment of ducks and chickens.
Not to mention a couple of swans.
All feathers.
Yeah, very expensive feathers.
I don't see how any pair of swans could cost $150. That was a gyp.
If you'd run, as I told you to, we shouldn't have had to pay for them.
Susan, when a man is wrestling a leopard in the middle of a pond... he's in no position to run.
There it is, David. Please hurry up.
Why, of all places, when you have a leopard in the car... did you stop in a town where there's a circus?
I didn't stop because there's a circus, but Baby's going to be hungry.
Please hurry. If Baby wakes up, we'll be in trouble.
I don't suppose it will make any difference, but you're parked in front of a fireplug.
I know it. Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.
50¢, $1.00. Thank you.
Yes. What can I do for you?
I want 30 pounds of sirloin steak, please.
Did you say 30 pounds?
- Yes, that's right, 30 pounds.
- How will you have it cut?
- Just in one piece.
- You going to roast it or broil it?
- It's going to be eaten raw.
- Yeah.
Hey, lady. That's a fireplug.
I know it.
- It's against the law to park alongside one.
- I know it.
- Come here.
- Who, me?
Why?
I am Constable Slocum.
Is that so?
- How do you do? I'm Susan Vance.
- How do you do?
I don't care who you are, I just want you to know you can't park beside a fireplug.
- I was just watching the parade.
- You were?
I suppose you get free seats to the circus.
Elmer and I usually get a...
That has nothing to do with it.
I'm just going to give you a ticket.
Thank you very much.
I'd love to go to the circus... but you better keep your tickets because I'm busy tonight.
Yeah?
Well, it ain't that kind of a ticket.
Jeepers.
Young lady, it might interest you to know that you're under arrest.
Oh, well. I mean, why?
For parking alongside of a fireplug.
I'm not parked next to a fireplug.
Yeah?
What do you call that?
You mean that you think that this is my car?
Ain't it?
No. That's my car.
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
You didn't ask me.
Say, do you grind this up before you eat it?
This isn't for me. It's for Baby.
For who?
Hurry up, Baby. Get in!
- But...
- Jump on!
That isn't your car!
No, but it's my leopard!
- Wait a minute! That's my car!
- What are you yelling about?
They stole my car.
Last night, she tried to steal my wife's purse.
Don't stand there. Do something! Catch them!
Well, Elmer, bless me. Bring back that car!
- I'm glad we finally got here
- Isn't it wonderful?
We could put him in that box Wait, don't open the door
- until you close those
- I think that is a good idea, too
I hope he won't get out
Stand by that door, and I'll open this one
He'll just walk along, I hope
Come on, Baby. Go on
In the stall, Baby
Come on, baby, right in there, right in there
Right in there
Now eerything is quite all right
No, eerything is not all
Everything is not all right, Susan. Maybe for you, but I've got to get to New York.
Now one thing's settled, you start worrying about something else.
One of us should worry! On top of all this, we've stolen a car!
That's all right. I'll send it back. I don't like it, anyway.
I suppose you'd like me to leave it with the constable on my way back.
No, you might be arrested. Besides, it's a hot car.
You're going to file the numbers off the engine.
No, I'll have the gardener take it back after it's dark.
- Stop it!
- You're shedding.
Now, where's the telephone?
- Out that door.
- That's all I want to know.
What I want to suggest is...
I don't want any more suggestions from you. My fiancée is waiting for me.
In order to get married, I have to get to New York.
I want you to be married, I think you should be married.
I think every man should be. But I don't think any girl will marry you...
- Iooking the way you do.
- Where's the phone?
- In there, but look at yourself.
- What's the matter with me?
I am dirty, aren't I?
You see?
What I want to suggest is...
The only way I'll follow another of your suggestions... is if you hold a bright object in front of my eyes and twirl it.
I understand. I simply wanted to suggest...
I don't want any suggestions.
Where is there a shower?
That's what I was going to suggest, a shower.
- Hannah.
- Yes, Miss Susan?
Send these into town and have them cleaned and pressed.
- Why? I can do them here.
- Don't argue with me, Hannah.
Into town. Have them cleaned and pressed.
It'll take a lot longer.
There's no hurry, no hurry at all.
- Hurry up, David.
- I am hurrying.
- David.
- What?
- What's in the box?
- What did you say?
That's the intercostal clavicle of a brontosaurus.
Really?
It's just an old bone.
Yes, it's just an old bone.
Put it down gently and go away.
All right. Is there anything else I can do for you?
Hand me my clothes, will you?
They aren't here. They're being pressed.
- What?
- The gardener's taken them into town.
For what? Stop him.
I can't wait. I must leave immediately.
You can't leave without clothes.
I know that. Where are you going?
I'm going to take a shower.
Susan! Don't leave me here like this!
Don't be impatient, David.
We'll talk it over after I've finished. Everything's going to be all right.
"Everything's going to be all right."
Certainly, everything's going to be all right.
Everything's going to be...
I'm losing my mind, that's all.
Roaming around Connecticut without any clothes on.
I don't believe it. How can all these things happen to just one person?
Susan, where are you?
Will you come out and help me find some clothes or must I come in and get you?
You wouldn't.
Yes, I would!
Maybe I wouldn't.
- Susan, where's the gardener's room?
- Why?
- Because he must have some clothes.
- What?
I can't hear you.
- You can hear what you want to hear!
- What did you say?
I just said... Never mind.
I'll find the place myself.
The gardener must have clothes. Clothes are clothes.
The gardener's in town.
He couldn't have taken all his clothes with him!
Yes, he could.
Of all the conceited, spoiled little scatterbrains.
My goodness, the man who gets...
The man who gets you is gonna have a lifetime of misery!
"Everything's going to be all right."
What do you want?
Who are you?
- Who are you?
- What do you want?
Who are you?
I don't know. I'm not quite myself today.
You look perfectly idiotic in those clothes.
These aren't my clothes.
Where are your clothes?
I've lost my clothes.
But why are you wearing these clothes?
Because I just went gay all of a sudden! Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Now, young man. Stop this nonsense. What are you doing?
I'm sitting in the middle of 42nd Street waiting for a bus.
Go away!
- Who is this man?
- I don't know.
- Stop it, George! What's he doing here?
- I don't know.
Susan, come back here. Stop it, George!
Aunt Elizabeth, it's you! I've never been so thrilled in my life.
This is amazing to see you here, and George dear.
- What made you come out here?
- Quiet, George!
Now, stop gushing and tell me, who is this man?
- Where'd you get him?
- He's a friend of Mark's.
- What's he doing here?
- Susan brought me.
I don't doubt it, but why?
I got a letter from Mark.
He said David was an old friend of his.
He'd been working very hard in town... and was on the point of having a nervous breakdown.
I'm a nut from Brazil.
He's very excitable. We let him do whatever he wants.
- Where are his clothes?
- Susan took them.
- What's he doing in that thing? - Mark said he should be allowed... to wear a negligee.
No telling what'll happen if he's not allowed to.
Does he want to wear those clothes?
No, I don't want to wear this thing. I just want to get married!
Susan, I forbid it! I absolutely put my foot down. The idea!
- Quiet!
- Please listen to me!
- Quiet!
- Don't talk so much.
Perhaps you could help me.
Perhaps you could help me find some clothes.
Why, yes.
There must be some of Mark's things around somewhere.
- Aren't there some...
- Are there?
Well...
Yes. There are some in Mr. Mark's room, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Which is Mr. Mark's room?
It's the end, sir. Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Go away.
He loves me. He loves me not.
David! Where'd he go?
He went to get some clothes.
If he gets clothes, he'll go away. He's the only man I've ever loved.
David! What will I do without David?
Stop. Get away from me.
George, please be quiet.
- David?
- What?
- Can I come in?
- I don't care what you do!
- Thanks. Where are you?
- Here I am. What do you want?
Go on and laugh.
I know it looks ridiculous, but I'm past caring.
What are you going to do?
What I've been trying to do, get back to New York!
You can't go dressed that way.
They're all I could find, and clothes are clothes. I'm going.
I'm going back to New York... if only to repair the damage that's been done since I've known you.
The damage to Miss Swallow, the museum, Mr. Peabody and everybody...
Mr. Peabody?
But, David... the one way to get to Mr. Peabody is through Aunt Elizabeth.
Please listen for one second. He'll do anything she tells him to.
He'll even like you. He's Aunt Elizabeth's lawyer.
He's her lawyer. Mr. Peabody.
- What's your aunt's name?
- Elizabeth.
- But she has another name. - Of course.
Never mind.
Don't tell me.
Why not? It's Random.
Mrs. Carleton Random.
- Yes, I know. I knew that was coming.
- What's the matter?
Out of seven million people, why did I have to run into you yesterday?
What have I done?
Susan, Mrs. Random is going to give away $1 million.
I know.
I wanted it for the museum.
I'm afraid you've made a rather unfavorable impression on Aunt Elizabeth.
I quite realize that.
- Susan, listen to me.
- What?
A lot of things have happened but we'll forget them because this is serious.
What, David?
Can you concentrate for just a moment?
There's only one thing to be done.
And this is important to me and to my work.
What?
You're so good-looking without your glasses.
- Listen to me. Try and remember.
- What?
I've made a horrible mess of things.
Your aunt must never find out who I am. You do understand, don't you?
Yes, David.
You can tell her that I'm Mark's friend and I have bats in the belfry... but don't ever tell her my name.
Can you remember that?
- Yes, David.
- You're sure?
Yes, David. But you are good-looking without your glasses.
Never mind, Susan.
What did I say?
What did I do?
What did I say?
- What did I do?
- I just asked you to remember...
- I swear I'll remember...
- Where is it?
- I know exactly what you told me to say.
- Where is it?
Where's what?
- My intercostal clavicle.
- Your what? My bone.
It's rare. It's precious. What did you do with it?
Your bone?
- You had it. Give it to me.
- I haven't got it.
- Did you carry it somewhere?
- Why would I carry a bone around?
I wouldn't dare give a reason for anything you do.
I guess you'll have to find another one.
It took three expeditions and five years to find that one!
Now that they know where to find one, couldn't you send them back for another?
Susan, you had it. You took it out of the box.
- Where did you put it?
- I put it back in the box.
- Was there somebody else in the room?
- There was nobody else, but...
- George.
- Who's George?
The dog. Don't you see? Dog, bone.
- George!
- George!
Stop it! You sound like an echo.
- George!
- Nice George.
Did you see him?
- See who? - George.
Are those the only clothes you could find?
Come back here this minute. What are you doing?
- Hunting for George.
- Why?
David wants him. David thinks he's such a nice dog. George?
He's a fiend, and you know it.
- But David doesn't. - Come here!
He's definitely not in the house.
Don't do that. He knows you want him. He'll hide.
Susan, where's he apt to go?
- George is apt to go anywhere.
- No. Where does he hide things?
- How can I tell?
- You ought to know.
There he is! George!
My goodness, look at his nose. He's been digging. He's buried it.
There are 26 acres in this garden.
That's awful. George, where did you hide that bone?
No, David, not that way. Now, George, we're not angry.
David and Susan need that bone.
It's a nasty old bone, it's hundreds of years old.
That's David's bone.
Susan will get you a nice, fresh bone if you'll show us where it is.
- Look at the nasty little cur!
- You'll ruin everything. Spell it.
George, don't be stubborn. Susan loves you.
Where'd you put it?
Don't you remember?
Where'd you dig?
He's not paying attention...
George!
It's easy if you know how to handle him.
Everything's going to be all right. This must be the spot.
He's going to start digging in a minute. That's right, George.
- It's very simple if you keep your head.
- I do hope he doesn't hurt that bone.
Isn't he a strong little man, David?
He's got something! Come on, dig.
- Dig.
- I'm digging.
I feel something!
I hope it isn't hurt.
Look, David, a boot.
- A boot.
- Don't hit George, David.
I wasn't going to hit George.
George, that was fine, but you've got to concentrate again.
David has to find his bone. No. Not in there.
- Isn't this fun?
Just like a game.
- Yes.
George, if you get tired of digging you just tell David and Susan... where you hid it, and they'll dig.
Susan, do you think George is really trying?
Almost every place he's taken us, we've found something.
- There's nothing here.
- Look, David, another boot.
Another boot. That makes three pairs.
Come on, George, quit stalling. Where is it?
Don't be discouraged.
George, concentrate. Bones, not boots.
- There he goes.
- See? He's got the idea.
- I'm getting tired of all this digging.
- Yes, what we need is a plow.
- Susan?
- Jeepers, it's Aunt Elizabeth.
Follow him, David, don't let him get away!
Yes, Aunty, I'm coming.
Susan, what on earth are you doing?
What are all these? Those?
They're holes.
I can see they're holes. How did they get here?
David and George and I were digging.
- Who is this David?
- He's a friend of Mark's.
- Is that all you know about him?
- I know I'm going to marry him.
He doesn't know it, but I am.
If you're planning to marry him on my money, you're mistaken.
I don't want another lunatic in my family, I've got enough.
When are you going to marry him?
What's his name?
It's Bone.
- Bones?
- One Bone.
One bone or two, it's a ridiculous name. What does he do?
He hunts.
Hunts?
Hunts what?
Well, animals, I should think.
- Big-game hunting? - Yes.
Very big.
You call that big-game hunting?
Look at that.
Aunty, he's just playing with George.
He won't play with George another minute.
Tell him dinner's at 8:30 sharp.
George, come here this minute!
Come along, George.
Yes, Alice, I am in Connecticut, but I can't get in... because I've been unavoidably detained.
David, listen.
I can't hear you. I'm talking.
Go away. I'll be with you as soon as I'm finished.
Now, David, you have to listen to me.
Yes, I know that...
Susan, will you please get off the phone?
David, it's about the leopard. He's making the most terrific rumpus.
- He's hungry. We've got to feed him.
- I can't help that.
What, Alice, dear?
No, it's somebody on the line.
- Keep quiet, Susan.
- You've got to help. This can't wait.
If the people in this house hear him... they'll think something terrible has happened.
Susan, get off the line, please...
Hello, Alice.
What?
I don't know what time it is!
When you hear the tone, the time will be 7:37 and one quarter.
Susan, please!
Alice, I can't hear you.
When you hear the tone, the time will be 7:40.
When you hear the tone, the time will be 7:40 and one half.
When you hear the tone, the time will be 7:41.
Pardon me. The time is 8:10.
When you hear the tone, the time will be...
No. My watch shows 8:10 and a quarter.
Who are you?
Who am I?
I'm 8:10...
I'm Major Horace Applegate.
- What do you want?
- Mrs. Random invited me for dinner.
Would you please find out if she still wants me?
She's hung up.
So am I.
Why, Horace, what are you doing?
Are you coming in or going out?
He's coming in to dinner.
- How do you do? I'm Susan Vance.
- How do you do, Miss Susan?
- Hello, Elizabeth.
- You're much too big to swing on gates.
- I found that out.
- Susan, where are you going?
I'm just going out.
You should be watching George, not playing with telephones...
Excuse me.
George is fast asleep in my room.
Now come here, young man, and don't be afraid.
- You look much better in those clothes.
- Thank you.
- I want you to meet Mr. Bone.
- How do you do, Mr. Bone?
No. You're Mr. Bone. This is Major Applegate.
Yes, I'm Major Applegate. At least, I'm pretty sure I am.
That is, I was this morning.
There must be some mistake.
No mistake. I've known Major Applegate for 20 years. Haven't I, Horace?
Twenty-two, to be exact, I think, Elizabeth.
It was long about...
- How do you do, Mr. Applegate?
- How do you do again. Thank you.
- Now, Mr. Bone, we'll go for a walk.
- I'd like to explain...
- You don't need to.
- That's all right. I understand.
Goodbye, Major Applegate...
Mr. Bone.
Strange young man, isn't he?
Is he suffering from something?
He's had a nervous breakdown.
- Had or has?
- Had.
It's left him sort of...
You know.
My, my, what a pity. And so young, too.
The trouble is, Susan seems to be showing the same tendencies.
Is that so?
You're all right, though?
- I hope so. Have a drink.
- Thank you.
Conversation at dinner may be a trifle difficult... on account of this young man, so I want you to draw him out.
I don't know what you mean.
Talk about something he understands. Big-game hunting, for instance.
- He's a hunter like yourself.
- You don't say.
Then, Elizabeth, you've come to the right man.
There. He's fed. Now I'm sure he's going to be quiet.
Come on, let's go in to dinner.
Why are you just sitting there?
I'm just trying to figure out how I ever got mixed up in all this.
"Mr. Bone." Isn't that amazing?
You told me not to tell Aunt Elizabeth what your real name was.
I didn't tell you to think up a name like Bone.
Stay there, George.
Come on, quickly!
- Shut the door.
- What's the matter?
Did you ever think what would happen if Baby and George got together?
- They'd probably like each other.
- And if they didn't?
- Baby would eat George.
- That's what I mean.
There it was, straight before me, crouching as tigers do before the kill.
But I was ready for him.
I drew a bead, leveled away and caught him right between the eyes.
My, it certainly was a thrilling experience... as I'm sure you'll all agree... or do you, Mr. Bone?
Have you ever been...
Pardon me. So sorry.
Have you ever been in Arabia, Mr. Bone?
I said, "Have you ever been in Arabia?"
No.
I suppose you've spent most of your time in Africa?
- Tibet, perhaps?
- No. - Malay Peninsula, perchance?
- Excuse me.
At least that got a rise out of him.
You see, you shouldn't have mentioned the Malay Peninsula.
He was horribly clawed there by a tiger. He doesn't like talking about it.
I had a gun bearer once who was clawed by a tiger.
He...
The poor...
I was just telling Major Applegate that you were clawed by a tiger... in the Malay Peninsula.
I've never been there.
You've never...
Well, no matter.
What type of gun do you use in hunting tigers, Mr. Bone?
I personally use a bolt-action Mauser with a very large bore.
Excuse me.
Susan, imagine giving a dinner party with your husband stalking... like Hamlet's ghost all through the meal.
Give me patience.
No, this is too much. I can't stand it.
We were talking about the jungle while you were away, Mr. Bone.
- My soup is gone.
- It was cold.
Digging trenches. Blaming it on an innocent dog.
Nothing but a heap of nonsense.
Enough to drive a man crazy.
And then they say, "Keep away from the bottle. Don't drink."
No, not even a wee drop to steady a man's nerves.
If one more thing happens, I'll quit.
And where Aloysius Gogarty goes, Mrs. Aloysius Gogarty goes, too.
A doctor chasing after a dog!
Just picture it.
A vast, mysterious silence vibrant with life... strange cries in the night.
- Good gracious, what was that?
- That was a loon, Elizabeth.
L-O-O-N, yes.
Once you've got the jungle in your blood, I wouldn't be able to keep you out of it.
- Susan, did you hear that?
- I didn't hear a thing.
- You didn't?
- Are you quite sure that was a loon?
Yes, indeed. I've heard many a loon.
And if there ever was a loon, that is a loon.
- Isn't it, Mr. Bone?
- No.
- Well, what do you say it was?
- A leopard.
Don't be ridiculous.
Major Applegate would know a leopard cry if he heard it.
Thank you, Elizabeth. I'm an authority on animal cries.
Now, you take the rogue elephant, for instance.
Excuse me, Major. You're right. It is a loon.
Thank you.
The leopard's cry is something that, once heard, you can never forget.
Yes, I know.
You know. Thank you.
Of course, it varies at different seasons.
- Let me see now, what month is this?
- June.
June?
It would go something like this.
I'll just prepare for it.
Now, let me see.
There we have it.
- Pardon me.
- It's still a loon.
Of course, I haven't practiced the leopard cry in a long time.
I'm slightly out of voice.
- Try again.
- Yes, I shall.
Now, I didn't do that.
It was probably an echo.
It was a long time coming back, wasn't it?
- Try again.
- I shall.
There. That's better.
That's peculiar.
There aren't any leopards in Connecticut, are there?
- Yes.
- No.
- Why do you say yes?
- You see...
Pardon me.
Excuse me.
Susan! Finish your dinner and stop this nonsense.
All right, but you'll be sorry.
I can't stand it. I've got to get away from it.
Instead of sitting decently at the table eating their dinners... they're howling and roaring at one another like a lot of banshees.
And then they say, "Gogarty, you mustn't drink.
"Gogarty, you must keep away from the bottle."
The bottle.
As if a man didn't need something to listen to them.
I'm within my rights.
I'm perfectly within my...
If one more thing happens to upset me, I'll be seeing things.
Hannah.
Hannah Gogarty!
Me gun!
- Now what's happened?
- This is no time for personalities.
What would you be wanting of a gun now?
Hand me my gun.
Be quiet, both of you!
Gogarty, what is all this?
- I saw it outside.
- Saw what?
A cat as big as a cow, with eyes like balls of fire.
Clean up this mess. And serve the next course.
Do you realize what's happened?
Baby's escaped!
- I don't care.
- We've got to catch him.
- I've got to watch George.
- You're not staying here.
If you stay here, I'll tell Aunty that your name is Dr. David Huxley.
- Right now.
- Don't! All right, I'll go with you.
Major Applegate, keep an eye on George! Thank you.
Baby! The door's open.
- Is he there?
- I don't know.
Nope, he's gone. Oh, dear. Now Aunt Elizabeth...
Don't lose your head.
- My what?
- Your head.
- I've got my head. I've lost my leopard.
- Now, wait a minute.
Nothing's gained by uncontrolled hysteria.
- Compose yourself.
- What should we do?
I'll call the zoo, say we saw a leopard, and they'll catch him. Come on.
Susan, I hope this time you've come to stay.
Yes, I've come to stay, Aunty.
We've just been walking up and down.
Where's that young man going now?
He's just going in to take a rest.
He has to take frequent rests. The doctor says...
Have you ever had jungle fever, Major?
You have. Then you realize how important rest is.
Poor Mr. Bone. In his case, it's rather difficult... because he has two doctors.
One says rest, one says exercise.
Which do you prefer?
- I think that perhaps...
- Why, Susan, listen to this.
- What?
- This is a cable from Mark.
- Mark?
- Not a particle of sense in it.
What does it say?
"Are you pleased with Baby?
Love, Mark."
- Mark?
- And not a word about my leopard.
Your leopard?
- I've always wanted a leopard.
- Excuse me.
You know, he promised...
Thank you very much.
Don't call the zoo.
- I just called. It's all fixed.
- Call back and unfix it.
- No questions, call back.
- I told them they could have the leopard.
You've given away Baby?
You have no right!
- It's your fault. You've ruined everything!
- I've had enough. I quit.
You can't quit. Call them back.
- But you said...
- Everything's changed.
- That leopard belongs to Aunt Elizabeth.
- Aunt Elizabeth?
Just call back and say you were mistaken.
I've just managed to convince them that I did see a leopard.
- They'll never believe me.
- I'll fix that. I'll say you're a drug addict.
- You're always seeing things.
- Never mind. Give me that phone.
- Hello, operator?
- Not so loud.
Get me Westlake-284.
- I don't know...
- Never mind, David.
Hello. Is that zoo?
Nobody's talking baby talk.
I'm the man that called up about the leopard.
You don't have to do anything. It's all been a mistake.
- Stop them!
- What's the matter?
- What did he say?
- It's too late. It was the night watchman.
- He said everybody's out leopard hunting.
- Jeepers!
You've gotten us into a wonderful mess. Let's think before we act.
- You think. You think faster than me.
- What do you take to catch a leopard?
- How big a leopard?
- We've got to catch him before they do.
- I've got to watch George.
- We'll take George with us.
Aunty, we're taking George for a walk.
- Where's the leash?
- My goodness!
- Where's George?
- Where's George?
- Why this morbid interest?
- I've got to find him.
What for?
He knows where my intercostal clavicle is.
Your what?
Major Appletree, you promised to watch George.
- I did.
- But you didn't.
Where is he?
- He's gone.
- Gone where?
- Out that door.
- Why didn't you say so?
No, not that door. That door.
- Thank you.
- That's right.
I can't stand this another moment.
Come along. Let's get some fresh air.
- Yes. Shall we run?
- Yes.
I can't understand why a loon would answer a leopard's cry.
There's something wrong.
- They both sound exactly alike to me.
- No, pardon me, Elizabeth.
Please, the leopard's cry is entirely different.
As I explained to you in there, the leopard's cry goes like this.
What a terrible noise. I don't see how you do it.
It's done largely with the palate.
The hands play an important part in the resonance and carrying power.
- Why do you put your thumbs together?
- You see, the thumbs... it's very necessary that the base of the thumbs are close together like that.
That brings out a sort of pear-shaped tone, you see?
Having done this, you take a deep breath, keep the throat well open... and out comes...
My. That's fine, Elizabeth... for one who hasn't had any practice.
Really, it is. You've got something there.
- Got what?
- The mating cry.
- Now, don't be rude, Horace.
- I'm not rude.
I was merely alluding to the scream you did just now.
- I didn't scream.
- You didn't scream?
- I certainly did not.
- You didn't scream?
No. I ought to know if I screamed.
Then there must be something wrong here.
I should say so. I've never known anything like it.
Ever since I came into the house there's been something wrong.
- Elizabeth...
- It's been bedlam!
- Don't you think it's time we went inside?
- No. We've only just left it.
But don't you think it's a good idea to go back?
No, I think it's a good idea to continue our walk.
But don't you find it a bit chilly without a gun?
- Why don't you sing, David?
- I can't.
- You can. You have a fine strong voice.
- But not for singing.
It's not fair. You're just being stubborn.
- That's a dog.
- George.
- What's the matter?
- Something moved in that bush.
Let me go first.
Don't you think it would be better if I went first?
No. You might get hurt.
Thank you, David.
- I can't see a thing.
- Neither can I.
Are you sure you saw something moving in here, because I can't...
Susan, where are you?
- Here I am.
- This is no time to be playing squat tag.
I'm not playing.
I'm caught on something. Help me, will you?
- Help me, will you?
- No. That's poison ivy.
I bet you wouldn't treat Miss Swallow this way.
I'll bet she knows poison ivy when she sees it.
Yes, I bet poison ivy runs when it sees her.
I'm not here to discuss Miss Swallow. I'm looking for George. I'll find him if...
David, are you all right?
- Don't laugh.
- I can't help it.
You look so silly.
Did you hear that?
That's Baby.
- It's George, too.
- You don't suppose...
Shut up.
Look!
Look, David, they like each other.
But goodness knows how long that's going to last.
In another minute, my intercostal clavicle will be gone forever.
Here, George. Come here.
No. Susan, be quiet.
Is there any way to cross this stream?
- Surely it's shallow. We can wade across.
- Good.
The riverbed's changed.
Did we get across?
No, we're right back where we started, only we're wet.
Now George and Baby have disappeared.
While you were at it, you might as well have gone to the other side.
While I'm wet I'm gonna go to the other side!
Don't leave me!
If we'd had a bathhouse, this wouldn't have been so complicated.
Next time I'll try and arrange one.
Or perhaps there are portable bathhouses for people like you. There must be.
Don't be so grouchy.
We could have such fun. There's moonlight and everything is so lovely.
- And I do so like being with you.
- You do?
Well, I like peace and quiet.
But it's peaceful and quiet here.
Let's just stay here and let George and Baby look for us.
Your sock's on fire.
That's all right. I don't care anymore.
- That's fine. Throw the other one in.
- That's true. You could have...
Don't be upset, David.
Well, who wouldn't be?
Here I am, trying to help you find a leopard... so that your Aunt Elizabeth won't be angry at you.
And then she'll probably give you the $1 million I need for my museum.
If you'd planned it, you couldn't have ruined my chances more completely.
You told your aunt I was crazy, didn't you?
You told her my name was Bone and you didn't tell me.
You told her I was a big-game hunter and didn't tell me.
You tell anybody anything that comes into your head... and you don't tell me.
- Here's something else I didn't tell you.
- What now?
Mr. Peabody's coming to see Aunt Elizabeth tonight.
Oh, dear. That's the end, that's all.
Peabody's sure to tell your aunt who I am.
He'll never remember those four years' hard work...
I put in on that brontosaurus. No.
All he'll remember is that I conked him on the head with a rock last night.
Where's that music coming from, David?
Westlake. There's a circus there. A...
Come and see the Harem Nights, boys.
Sheena and Neema. They'e just escaped from the palace of a sheik.
The owner's got a job for you.
He wants you to take his leopard to Bridgeport.
- What happened?
- Just gave his new trainer a going-over.
Hurt him bad?
Bad?
You think three minutes alone with that cat did him any good?
Should've shot him last summer, when he ripped up Calhouney.
What do we do with him?
Deliver him to this address. They've got a gas chamber.
- I've phoned over. You go along, too, Mac.
- Who, me?
- You heard what I said.
- Where is Bridgeport?
How should I know?
Somewhere on the state highway.
Ask somebody, and get going.
- Well, that's that. Let's get going.
- All right.
Sure you don't want my coat?
- No, I'm completely dry.
- Let's go, then.
I wonder what that is?
Hey, Mac, see what that sign says.
- David, it's the zoo truck.
- Is it?
They've got Baby.
Is George with him?
I can't see George, but we've got to get Baby away from them.
No. All I promised to do was help you find Baby.
You found him.
All you have to do is go and talk to those men in the front... while I let Baby out the back.
But what'll I say to them?
They're from the zoo. Tell them you're a zoologist.
Talk about zoos. Go ahead, go on.
I can't find Bridgeport.
You've got the map upside down.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Hello.
May I help you?
Yeah. Do you know the way to Bridgeport?
I'm not going to Bridgeport.
Not you. We're going to Bridgeport. Do you know which way it is?
- Yes.
- It's that way, ain't it?
- Yes.
- But I thought it was that way.
- Yes, it is.
- There, I told you.
Don't you worry. I'll soon get you out.
Come on.
Get this around your neck, that's a good boy.
Put your head through. Come on.
Hey, what's the big idea?
Come on.
Put your head through here, and I'll take you back home.
Come on, sweetie.
...and New York is straight ahead.
This guy ain't got all his buttons.
Well, I...
You see...
- We have a...
- David, he's escaped!
- I was just explaining to these gentlemen...
- He's escaped!
Oh, he's escaped. Shall we help you tie him up, lady?
No, not me. You're mistaken.
Goodnight, gentlemen.
Over there. We're on the right track now, I'm sure.
Do you see him?
- I think he's further down this way.
- I'll try here.
I'm absolutely certain the sound's coming from this way.
- What's that?
- Somebody's shooting at him.
- You missed it again.
- Quiet!
Major Applegate, don't shoot.
Stand back, please. I won't miss this time.
You don't understand. We're trying to catch it.
- You are?
Well, so am I.
- It's a tame leopard.
I don't like to say so at this moment, but everybody knows you're crazy.
- Please don't do that.
- Miss Susan, please!
Why don't you explain to him?
Perhaps he'll catch your leopard.
You know that Aunt Elizabeth was expecting a leopard from Brazil, don't you?
- I had heard that.
- Well, that's her leopard, and it's tame.
Impossible. There can be no such thing as a tame...
A tame leopard?
We had it locked up and it escaped.
- Are you sure it's quite harmless?
- Absolutely.
My goodness, why didn't you say so in the first place?
I apologize to you, Mr. Boney, I really do.
Even though it is tame, I think we should try to catch it.
Which way did it go?
That way.
We'll go that way, you go that way. Come on, David.
Don't shoot.
No, of course not.
I knew all the time he was tame.
- Is that so?
- Yes, I patted him on the back.
Stretched me hand right out, patted him on the back.
- He's as gentle as a kitty.
- Gentle as a kitty?
I don't know why you didn't mention all this...
There he is.
This will all be quite simple. Let me have that rope, will you?
Now, you hold the gun. We shan't need that any further.
Gogarty, you stand perfectly still and leave everything to me.
I've had vast experience in these matters.
Here, kitty.
Come, kitty.
Don't you fool me.
You're not afraid of me, now, are you?
Come, puss.
You say you patted this beast?
In a manner of speaking, I did.
Personally, Gogarty, I think you're a liar.
Get out of me way!
Use the gun!
- You see him, David?
- No.
I seem to have lost my sense of direction. I wonder where we are.
My guess is, somewhere near the Canadian border by now.
My glasses! Don't move, Susan.
Here they are.
They're broken. I'm so sorry.
It doesn't make any difference.
The things I've been doing today, I can do just as well with my eyes shut.
Anyway, David, you look much handsomer without them.
Stop it.
Look, David, I've lost my heel! Look at me walk.
- Born on the side of a hill.
- Stop.
- I was born on the side of a hill.
- Stop.
Look, Susan, we're not getting anywhere like this.
You must be very tired, and I suggest you go home.
But, David, we can't quit now.
We've let a wild animal loose on an innocent countryside.
We can't just go home and sleep. It wouldn't be right.
You misunderstand me. I want you to go home.
- You mean you want me to go home?
- Yes.
You mean you don't want me to help you anymore?
- No.
- After all the fun we've had?
- Yes.
- And after all the things I've done for you?
That's what I mean.
All right, I know enough to go when I'm not wanted.
And don't you worry about me, I can take care of myself.
Oh, my goodness.
Are you all right?
Did you hurt yourself?
No, I didn't hurt myself. It's not that.
It's just that I'm miserable because you don't like me anymore.
Yes, I do.
You tried to get rid of me and you don't think of me.
You don't like me anymore.
Your face is dirty.
Now you're being nice to me... after all the horrible things I've done to you.
Stop crying, Susan, please.
It's just that everything I do with the best intentions... seems to turn out badly.
Yes, it does, doesn't it?
Please let me come with you.
All right, Susan. You can come with me.
- Are you sure you want me?
- Yes.
- Positive?
- Yes, you can come. Come on.
Well, don't you worry, David.
Because if there's anything that I can do to help you... just let me know, and I'll do it.
Don't do it until I let you know.
Come on, George.
Look, David. Baby's on the roof.
Come on, Baby. Come on down.
Make him get down.
I suppose you'd like me to climb up and push him down.
Maybe we'd better sing.
Sing, David.
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back!
Not you, it.
- What are you doing, may I ask? - Singing.
If you're paying a bet, there must be somewhere else to pay it.
I'm not paying a bet, there's a leopard on your roof.
I'm not going to bandy words with you at this time of night.
There is a leopard on your roof, and it's mine.
I have to get it, and to get it, I have to sing.
There's nothing on my roof.
Come on, you fool. There's nothing on your roof? - No!
- All right.
There's nothing on your roof.
Poor girl. You'd better go down, Fritz.
- Sing if you like, dear. - Thank you.
You can sing, too.
Baby, don't! Why did you have to do that?
You frightened him away.
- Quiet, it's all right.
- It's not all right.
- Don't worry.
- I have to worry. I've lost my leopard.
- Please help me find him.
- I will. Come with me.
- But he went that way.
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did. I saw him.
- You're wrong. He's up there.
- Where?
- Peeking around the corner. See it?
There's nothing there!
Yes, there is. You just come along into the house.
Let me go! I don't want to go with you.
You don't seem to understand that there's $1 million at stake.
$1 million?
Well, you will get it.
We have it right in there, all in $1 bills.
Now you come along. No!
Don't do this to me! This is awful!
Elmer, look.
- You know him? - No.
Looks like a peeping Tom.
Get your gun out. We'll nab him.
Stick them up.
Grab him, Elmer.
I have to get my dog. Don't go away, George!
Don't argue. Inside.
- What are you doing?
- I have a hairpin.
I did it once with a trunk.
Anyway, when they find out who we are, they'll let us out.
When they find out who you are, they'll pad the cell.
We've picked up a girl who says she's your niece.
Now, the question is, have you or have you not got a niece?
Of course I have a niece, but she's not singing around under windows.
She's decently in bed.
I wouldn't be too sure, Elizabeth.
Horace, do be quiet. I'll talk to you presently.
Now, lady, do you definitely refuse to come and identify this girl?
If you continue to annoy me about this girl... who is no responsibility of mine, I'll have you arrested.
- The idea. - Hello.
She says her niece is in bed.
Just what I expected. That girl is lying.
- I think they're both lying.
- What are you going to do about it?
- What would you do?
- Find out the truth.
You're right. I'll have a little talk with them.
Come on, Elmer. Open her up.
You two, get your ears up 'cause I've got something to tell you.
- Lf you wanna get out, better listen.
- I'm listening. Quiet.
I'll get to you later.
I want you to tell me the whole truth.
- What did my aunt say? - Be quiet, please.
What did my aunt say?
Your aunt said...
Young lady, you haven't got an aunt.
- I certainly have got an aunt.
- Quiet, please.
Look here, young fellow, I want you to tell me... just exactly what were you doing tonight?
- We were hunting for a leopard.
- You were hunting for a leopard?
Now look here, young lady, you know that's silly.
- There never was a leopard in Connecticut.
- There is now.
Now, listen here.
I'm going to stay here if it takes all year. I am waiting for you to tell the truth.
If you wait for her to tell the truth, you'll have a long gray beard.
You know, my grandfather had... Quiet!
Young man, I don't want any more slick remarks out of you.
This is a jail. Have a little respect for the law.
I'm just trying to explain.
It all started over at my aunt...
Her aunt's house.
Her aunt's house?
- Her aunt promised to give me a lot of...
- Hold on there, bub.
Just a minute.
She hasn't got an aunt. I do.
She's my father's sister.
Look here, Constable, stop wasting your time. Now, quiet.
You want us to get out of here, don't you?
Lady, yes, I certainly do.
I gave you my aunt's telephone number, didn't I?
And you called her up, didn't you?
What did she say?
- She said that you were home in bed.
- Then what am I doing here?
You're here because your aunt...
Confound it, lady, you know that you haven't got an aunt.
- Lf I did have an aunt...
- She'd muzzle you.
You can't talk to me that way.
I don't like to see young people in jail. I have children of my own.
I don't care about your family. All I want to do is get out of here.
I don't have time to waste sitting around in jail.
- Go away, please.
- Shut up, David.
- David, please be quiet.
- Let me tell you what happened.
You're not going to get anywhere with her. Just come with me.
If one of us talks at a time, now we're really getting somewhere.
Now then, speak up, speak fast.
- I'll explain the whole thing...
- Elmer!
Get the key here, quick. Lock him up.
A fine officer you are.
Locking up a dangerous criminal without locking him up.
- Look, it's not locked. - Thank you.
I've seen it! I've seen a cheetah in the park.
You have no right to do that!
What's going on here?
- Here's something for you, Constable.
- What's the charge?
We caught him in front of the meat market in Dr. Lehman's stolen car.
So you're a car thief?
No man is going to call Aloysius Gogarty a car thief.
Come on!
Lock him up.
Hey, let go!
Here you are, fellow. This should hold you for a while.
Hello, Gogarty.
Hello, Miss Susan. How did you get here?
Influence.
Don't worry, Gogarty. I'll get you out. Sure.
Look, she got me out. Hold on here.
Do you know this young lady?
Of course. Don't I work for her aunt?
- You what?
- Don't I work for her aunt?
If one more person mentions that she's got an aunt...
I'll put you all on bread and water for 30 days.
Well, where is everyone?
Who's in charge here?
Right in there. Hey, Constable!
What do you mean by locking up my niece?
I won't stand for it! Give me the keys.
Madam, you're hysterical.
- What is it you want?
- She wants her niece.
I certainly do. I want my niece right here.
- Who is your niece?
- Give us a description of her.
- She's about so tall...
- Aunt Elizabeth, is that you?
There she is now.
Hold on just a minute. Lady, tell me, who are you?
I am Mrs. Carleton Random, and I want my niece.
- You're Mrs. Carleton Random? - I certainly am.
- And you say your niece is here?
- She certainly is.
That's where I got you. The young lady here ain't got no aunt.
And you're not Mrs. Carleton Random, because I talked to her... on the phone not 10 minutes ago.
I ought to know who I am!
Yes, you should, I think.
You did talk to her 10 minutes ago... on the phone.
- How do you know?
- I was there.
- Who are you?
- I'm the niece...
I'm the aunt...
I'm Major Horace Applegate of the Explorer's Club.
What are you doing with that gun?
I have been hunting a leopard.
- You've been hunting leopards?
- I said so, yes.
- Any luck?
- Not what I'm accustomed to, no.
I have been a bit confused regarding the leopards here. - Boys.
- You have something on your mind.
Not so fast, lady. We just want to find out.
This old battle-ax keeps yelling that she's Mrs. Random.
Why, that's ridiculous.
Mrs. Random is in bed.
And don't you be calling up here again. Good night.
Good night.
Well, just as you said, doc, they're all lying.
Obviously. I have no doubt you'll find you made a very important haul.
Yeah, thanks to you, doc.
If you get their confessions, there'll be a lot of things you will turn up. Yeah?
Well, I'll try it again.
Come on, boys.
Quiet!
I'm warning you. The first one who lets a squeak out...
I'll put in solitary confinement.
I'm gonna ask this man some questions. I want absolute quiet.
You said your name's Bone. You stick to it?
Won't do any good, we don't believe you. We know that's an alias.
- They're all impersonators.
- Why'd you try to break into his house?
I was after a leopard. Leopard.
Doc, they still stick to it.
All agreed on one story.
How about that bank robbery in Oldtown?
What about it?
How much did they get?
They got a pretty penny. Must've got $5,600...
Say, who's asking the questions, you or me?
Who was with you last month in that mail-truck job?
Mickey the Mouse and Donald the Duck.
Doc, make a note of their names.
Now we're getting someplace. You've gotta speak up.
Quiet, lady.
I'm waiting for you.
Quiet, lady.
Speak up now.
Hey, flatfoot!
You ain't getting no place. Come here. - Me?
- Yes, you.
Come on, haul it over.
You want someone to talk, don't you?
It's about time. I certainly do.
Get me out and I'll unbutton my puss and shoot the works.
Say, hold on, lady. I thought that you were...
- You ain't no lady!
- I kind of had you fooled, didn't I?
Always wanted to make a sucker out of a copper.
What did I tell you my name was?
- Your name is...
Doc, what's her name?
- Susan Vance.
Vaunce, kiddie.
That's my society moniker.
But the mob all calls me "Swinging Door" Susie.
Now you peg me?
Come on, toots, open up.
- Open up, I'll make you feel hot. - Stop that.
I'm not opening any doors here until you promise to talk.
I talk, I'll talk so much, it'll make your hair curl.
Hear that, doc? She's promised to talk.
All right, open it up.
Susan, whatever it is, it won't work.
"Swinging Door" Susie hasn't flopped yet. I'm out this far, ain't I?
Well, so long, gang.
I'm not taking the rap for this job. It's every man for himself.
Quiet! I meant what I told you. You, too.
Quit beefing. Get wise to your pal. The heat's on, Jerry.
Ain't his name Bone?
You mean to say you don't remember Jerry the Nipper?
Make a note of that, doc.
She's making all this up out of motion pictures.
I thought I saw you with that red-headed skirt in a motion picture.
There, doc, another woman. Sure.
I wouldn't be squealing if he hadn't been with another twist.
So he's a lady-killer?
A lady-killer?
Why, he's a regular Don Swan.
Loves the ladies, don't you, honey?
He bops them over. 1, 2, 3, boom! Just like that.
- He's a wolf.
- Now I'm a wolf!
I'll send you a box of birdseed.
Susie, I want you to tell the truth. You'll never get into trouble.
You're limping. I suppose you got shot in a stickup?
- No, I lost my heel. - Don't bother about him.
Sit down there.
Doc, grab this chair.
Elmer, grab a hold of that typewriter.
I wanna get this whole thing down in affidavit form.
- Young lady, I want you to talk...
- Cigarette me, then I'll talk.
- I don't smoke cigarettes.
- This will have to do. - That?
- It's a twofer.
- What's that? - Two for a nickel.
Give me a match.
I'm not going to stand for that in this jail.
No smoking, no talking. Put me back in the cell.
Ain't gonna talk unless I have a cigarette. Hold it.
Sit down.
Doc, give her one of them cigarettes.
If you'll just tell the truth, we'll make it as easy as we can...
My case, if you please.
There I go again. Sorry. Force of habit.
How about a little fresh air?
It's kind of hot in here.
It is a little bit muggy.
It's always that way around here, this time of year.
It's the humidity.
What about the Cleghorn jewels?
That's hot ice. We're waiting for it to cool off.
We're waiting...
What do you mean, "we"?
The gang. All of us.
You all belong to the same gang? Sure.
The Leopard Gang.
That's what I'm after.
We'll round them all up with one fell swoop.
Got that, doc? Fine.
How about you, Elmer?
Not so fast. This is new to me. Hold on.
You can't spell "leopard" with a "U."
- How do you spell it?
- Double "U."
- What about that bank robbery?
- Boy, wasn't that a honey?
A neater job has never been pulled in this neck of the woods.
Jerry was the inside man on that job.
He was, was he?
Were you there, too?
Sure, what do you think?
I'm a one-man woman.
Where my man goes, I go.
"Babyface" Horace, he's the pick-up man...
Wait!
You're talking too fast!
What's that?
Confound it, doc! You only got as far as the Cleghorn jewels.
We gotta start all over again. Now, young lady...
- There she goes.
- She's got my car again!
Go on, boys, after her. Hurry up and get her.
There she goes.
Go get her, boys! If you don't, there'll be a shakeup in this department.
- Are you the constable? - Yes.
I'm looking for...
Don't tell me you're looking for a leopard.
I'm looking for Mrs. Carleton Random.
So is everybody else. Let me tell you, she's not here.
- I have reason to believe she is here. - Who're you?
Her attorney, Alexander Peabody.
I'm Miss Swallow. I'm looking for a man by the name of Dr. David Huxley.
Is he here with Mrs. Random?
Lady, the only folks here is a woman who keeps saying she's Mrs. Random.
Then we got a gangster named Bone.
Then we have "Babyface" Horace. Stop it. Then...
What is it you want?
I can identify this gentleman.
You may remember me. I testified during the breaking of the Borden will.
Yes, I remember. I demand to see my client at once.
Slocum, you may have made a mistake.
And if you have made a mistake... your position as constable in this county will be in serious jeopardy.
- Are you sure he's the old lady's attorney? - Positively.
Election next week, too.
Mr. Peabody, just step right inside, and we'll straighten this thing out.
As a matter of fact, we don't make mistakes.
Here you are. Is she or ain't she Mrs. Random?
It's just about time you came.
Of course she's Mrs. Random. This is absurd. Open that door.
- I told you. - All right.
What about him?
- David, I don't understand...
- Alice, it's just one of those things.
I can't explain it. It happened, and here I am.
Yes, in the last place I expected to find you.
I don't like it any better than you do.
And let that young man out, too.
Shucks, looks like I got the whole thing fuddled up.
I'm sorry, that's all I can say.
You haven't heard the end of this, either.
I... Huxley!
Why did you throw rocks at me last night?
This is the young man to whom you wanted me to donate $1 million... for his museum?
No, I didn't. I changed my mind.
David, what have you done?
Just name anything, and I've done it.
Joe, what are we gonna tell them?
Tell them the truth. We lost the leopard.
You the constable around here?
Until the next election, anyway. What is it you want?
- We need some help.
- That's what I'm here for. What is it?
We're looking for...
Don't tell me you're looking for a leopard.
How did you know that?
- Know what?
- That we're looking for a leopard.
This has gone far enough. There are no leopards in the state of...
- Get down, everybody!
- That's a bad cat. Somebody get a gun.
Hold on, don't be alarmed. There's no need to be frightened.
Everything's going to be all right.
Hello, Baby.
- Is this my leopard? - Yes.
That's Baby.
He didn't act that way with me.
Wait a minute. That ain't my leopard.
Of course it isn't. That's why I took it out of the truck.
You never let that one out of the truck.
You couldn't touch our cat with a 10-foot pole.
You mean there's another leopard?
That's what I'm telling you.
Our cat came from the circus. He just clawed a man.
He's bad. My goodness!
Susan's out trying to catch the wrong leopard.
Poor darling Susan. She's in danger, and she's helpless without me.
What's the matter with you? Come on.
If you don't want to walk, I'll drag you.
You've got to get me out of this, Baby.
What's the matter?
You've been slapping at me the whole way.
We've got to get in here. You might as well come without being stubborn... because I'm going to drag you in.
I'm just as determined as you are, so you might just as well come with me.
I'm going to drag you in here.
I don't like jail any more than you do, but this is where we've got to be.
Did I fool you this time!
You thought I was doing the wrong thing, but I've got him.
No, you haven't, Susan. Look!
Boys! Don't leave me in here!
David, help me!
Run!
Run while you have the chance!
- I won't leave you.
I love you. - What?
Poke him, David.
Let go, Susan, please.
Please, go back. Can't you see I'm trying to get it into the cell?
Get in there!
Get the keys, Susan!
Give it to me.
You're wonderful.
You're absolutely wonderful.
You're a hero. You saved my life.
You'll go down in history. I've never seen such bravery...
Did you want to say something?
What was it?
David, you've fainted.
There's nothing else I can say, except that I'm glad... that before our marriage you showed yourself up in your true colors.
You're just a butterfly.
Now I'm a butterfly.
Where are you going, David? Don't go up there.
I want to talk to you.
See? I've got it.
I can't even see you. Now where are you?
There you are.
I followed George around for three days and dug holes with him.
And then he came and put it in my shoe. Darling, look!
David, don't be mad at me.
Thank you very much. Put it down on the table and go away.
I don't want to go away. I want to talk to you.
Write me a letter.
Don't! Go back, Susan!
Jeepers, it's high up here.
Please go back down the ladder quietly.
When I go down, I'll go down quietly, David... but I want to find out something first.
Why did you run up that ladder when I came in here?
If you must know, I'm afraid of you.
If you're afraid of me, that's the same as if...
Don't worry, everything's gonna be all right.
Every time you say that, something happens.
Please go down because you've already cost the museum $1 million.
I haven't. I've got the $1 million.
Aunt Elizabeth gave it to me... and I'm going to give it to you for the museum.
I'm sure they'll be very pleased.
Aren't you pleased, David?
- Yes, I suppose so, but...
- It's too late, isn't it?
I've made a mess of everything, haven't I?
I was so happy when I found the bone this morning.
If I could only make you understand.
All that happened, happened because I was trying to keep you near me.
I just did anything that came into my head.
I'm so sorry.
I ought to thank you. - Thank me?
- Yes.
For what?
I've just discovered that was the best day I ever had in my whole life.
- You don't mean it?
- I've never had a better time.
- But I was there.
- That's what made it so good.
- Did you really have a good time?
- Yes, I did! That's wonderful.
Do you realize what that means?
That means that you must like me a little bit.
- It's more than that. - Is it?
Yes.
I love you, I think.
That's wonderful because I love you, too.
Stop rocking, David.
I'm not rocking. I...
Please, the brontosaurus!
Four years' work went into this.
- Look out, Susan, something's going to...
- I'm falling!
Hold on, Susan! Hold on!
Don't let go!
David, look what I've done.
I'm so sorry.
David, can you ever forgive me?
You can, and you still love me.
- Susan, that...
- You do.
Hello.
- What's all this fuss about, Charters?
- I'm hanged if I know.
Danke schön. Danke schön.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm very sorry.
The train is little bit uphold.
And if you wish to stay in my hotel, you have to register immediately.
Why the deuce didn't he say so in the first place?
Ah.
Oh, how do you do, Miss Henderson? How do you do, ladies?
- It's a great honor to have you with us again.
- Nice to see you too, Boris.
- You haven't changed a bit since last Friday.
- I see you haven't shaved either.
- Is everything ready?
- Everything is ready. I didn't change anything.
Not even the sheets. We know. Lead on, Boris.
You see, I didn't expect you to come so quickly.
- Well, our legs gave out on us.
- That's odd.
- We had to do the last lap in a farm cart.
- Oh!
I see we've got company.
Don't tell me Cook's are running cheap tours here.
- What is it, Boris?
- It's the avalanche.
- Avalanche?
- Avalanche, Boris. Avalanche.
You see, in the spring we've got many avalanches.
You know, - bloop!
And everything disappear. Even train disappear under the avalanche.
But I'm going home tomorrow. How long before they dig it out?
By morning. It's lucky for you.
You can leave by this train instead of your own.
How you said it? Is a bad wind that blow nowhere no good.
Talking of wind, we haven't eaten since dawn.
- Serve us some supper, Boris, in our room.
- I could eat a horse.
- Don't put ideas into his head. Uh, some chicken, Boris.
- Yes.
- And a magnum of champagne.
- Absolutely.
- And make it snappy.
- Bandrika may have a dictator, but tonight we're painting it red.
Meanwhile we have to stand here cooling our heels, I suppose, eh?
Confounded impudence.
Oh, third-rate country. What do you expect?
- Wonder who all those women were. - Hmm.
Possibly Americans, I should think.
- You know, almighty dollar, old man.
- I suppose we'll have to wait here.
If only we hadn't missed that train at Budapest.
I don't want to rub it in, but if you hadn't insisted... on standing up until they finished their national anthem -
Yes, but you must show respect, Caldicott.
If I'd known it was going to last 20 minutes -
Well, it's always been my contention that The Hungarian Rhapsody... is not their national anthem.
- In any case, we were the only two standing.
- That's true.
- Well, I suppose we shall be in time after all.
- I doubt it.
That last report was pretty ghastly.
Do you remember? "England on the brink."
Yes, but that's newspaper sensationalism.
- The old country's been in some tight corners before.
- It looks pretty black.
Even if we get away first thing tomorrow morning, there's still the connection at B♪öâle.
- We'll probably be hours. - Mmm, that's true.
Well, somebody surely can help us. Oh, sir.
Would you happen to know what time the train leaves Bâle for England?
Oh. Really?
Fella doesn't speak English.
Hello? Alex.
Champagne. Miss Henderson.
Monsieur.
- Here's one leaves Bâle 21:20.
- 21:20?
- Yeah.
- Twenty. Twenty. Twelve from 21 is -
- Twenty-one -
- Eleven. No. Yes.
I regret, sir, there is only left two single room in front... or a little double room at the back.
- We'll, uh, take the two singles.
- Very well, sir. Here is.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
At least you might have asked me which I preferred.
My dear, a small double room at the back in a place like this -
You weren't so particular in Paris last autumn.
It was quite different then. The exhibition was at its height.
I realize that now. There's no need to rub it in.
- We want a private suite with a bath.
- Facing the mountain.
- Yes.
- With a shower, of course.
- Hot and cold.
- A private thingummy if you've got one.
Sorry, gentlemen.
The only things I've got is the maid's room.
- The what?
- Maid's room?
I'm sorry. The whole hotel is packed. Jammed to the sky.
That's impossible. We haven't fixed up yet.
You can't expect to put the two of us up in the maid's room.
Well, don't get excited. I'll remove the maid out.
Yes, I should think so. What? What are you talking about?
- I think I'd sooner sleep on the train.
- Would you?
- There is no 'eating on the train.
- No eating on the train?
Yes. I mean - Heating.
- Heating. There's no heating on the train.
- That's awkward.
- all right. We'll take it.
- Just a minute. With one condition.
You have to have the maid comes to your room, remove her wardrobe.
Anna.
She's a good girl, and I don't want to lose her.
We'd better go and dress.
- Rather primitive humor, I hope.
- Grown-up children, you know.
That was rather an awkward situation over that girl.
- Pity he couldn't have given us one each.
- Eh?
- I mean, uh, a room apiece.
- Oh.
I, Iris Matilda Henderson... a spinster of no particular parish... do hereby solemnly renounce my maidenly past... and do declare that on Thursday next, the 26th inst., being in my right mind...
I shall take the veil and the orange blossom... and change my name to Lady Charles Fotheringail.
Can't you get him to change his name instead?
The only thing I like about him is his mustache.
You're a couple of cynics. I'm very fond of him.
Well, I'm fond of rabbits, but they have to be kept down.
Rudolph, give me a hand.
Have you ever read about that little thing called love?
It used to be very popular.
Child, the carpet is already laid at St. George's, Hanover Square.
And Father's simply aching to have a coat of arms on the jam label.
To Iris and the happy days she's leaving behind.
And the blue-blooded check-chaser she's dashing to London to marry.
The blue-blooded check-chaser.
I have no regrets. I've been everywhere and done everything.
I've eaten caviar at Cannes... sausage rolls at the docks.
I've played baccarat at Biarritz... and darts with the rural dean.
What is there left for me but... marriage?
Oh!
It's this hanging about that gets me.
If only we knew what was happening in England.
Mustn't lose grip, Charters.
Come in.
- Did you follow that?
- I did.
Tell her this has gone far enough.
No, uh - No change, uh - change here.
Um, outside.
- She doesn't understand.
- No. Come on.
Oh!
Nothing newer than last month.
I don't suppose there is such a thing as a wireless set hereabouts.
Being in the dark like this - our communications cut off in a time of crisis.
Hello, hello, hello! London?
You want Mr. Seltzer? Yes. Hold on.
I'm going right to - to find where he is.
London.
Go on. Risk it.
Hello. Hello. You.
Huh? No, no, no. I'm not Mr. Seltzer.
Name's Charters. I don't suppose you know me. What?
Well, you needn't worry. They've just gone to fetch him.
Tell me. What's happening to England?
"Blowing a gale"? No, you don't follow me, sir.
I'm inquiring about the test match in Manchester.
Cricket, sir! Cricket! What?
You can't be in England and not know the test score.
- Fella says he doesn't know.
- Oh, silly ass.
Hello. Can't you find out? Nonsense.
Oh, all right. If you won't, you won't!
- Wasting my time. The fella's an ignoramus.
- Mr. Seltzer... at last your call come through to London.
Hello. Hello, hello. London.
Huh? London.
Thank you, waiter.
- What do you say to a grilled steak?
- That's a very good idea.
- Well done for me, please.
- On the red side for me.
These people have a passion for repeating themselves.
- I - I beg your pardon.
- Mm-hmm?
He's trying to explain to you that, owing to the large number of visitors, there's no food left.
No food?
What sort of place is this?
Expect us to share a blasted dog box with a servant girl on an empty stomach?
Is that hospitality? Is that organization?
Oh. Thank you.
- I'm hungry, you know.
- What a country. I don't wonder they have revolutions.
You're very welcome to what's left of the cheese.
Uh, of course, it's not like beefsteak, but it's awfully rich in vitamins.
- Really. Thank you very much.
- I'm afraid they're not accustomed to catering for so many people.
Bandrika is one of Europe's few undiscovered corners.
Yes. That's probably 'cause there's nothing worth discovering, I should think.
You may not know it as well as I do.
I'm feeling quite miserable at the thought of leaving it.
- After you with the cheese, please.
- Certainly, old man. Why not?
- So you're going home?
- Tomorrow.
My little charges are quite grown up.
I'm a governess and a music teacher, you know.
In the six years I've lived here, I've grown to love the country, especially the mountains.
I sometimes think they're like very friendly neighbors.
You know, the - the big father and mother mountain with their white snow hats.
And their nephews and nieces. Not quite so big. With smaller hats.
Right down to the tiniest hillock without any hat at all.
Well, of course, that's just my fancy.
- Oh, really.
- I like to watch them from my bedroom every night when there's a moon.
I'm so glad there's a moon tonight.
Do you hear that music?
Everyone sings here. The people are just like happy children... with laughter on their lips and music in their hearts.
- It's not reflected in their politics, you know.
- I never think you should judge any country by its politics.
After all, we English are quite honest by nature, aren't we?
You'll excuse me if I run away. Good night. Good night.
Good night.
Queer sort of bird.
Trifle whimsical, I thought.
Well, after six years in this hole, we'd be whimsical.
Oh, I don't think so, old man.
- She was very decent about that cheese.
- Mmm.
I see she's finished the pickles.
Good night, Iris.
- Listen. Someone's serenading.
- Oh, let him. Nothing will keep me awake tonight.
Good night, my children.
What's happening? An earthquake?
That would hardly account for the music, would it?
What a horrible noise.
- What can they be doing?
- I don't know, but I'll soon find out.
Hello.
Musical country, this.
- I feel quite sorry for that poor singer outside... having to compete with this.
Boris, Miss Henderson speaking.
Look. Someone upstairs is playing musical chairs with an elephant.
Move one of them out, will you? I want to get some sleep.
All right. That ought to settle it.
Thank you so much.
Some people have so little consideration for others... which makes life so much more difficult than it need be.
Don't you think? Well, good night. Thank you so much.
I expect you'll be going on the train in the morning.
- Yes.
- I hope we shall meet again under - under quieter circumstances.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Miss, please, I'Il fix everything.
You'd better.
Hold it. Steady. Don't move.
Uh -
- If you please, sir -
- Get out!
Please, sir. Will you kindly stop?
They are all complaining in the hotel. You make too much noise.
- Too much what?
- Too much noise.
You dare to call it a noise.
The ancient music with which your peasant ancestors... celebrated every wedding for countless generations.
The dance they danced when your father married your mother... always supposing you were born in wedlock, which I doubt.
Look at them.
- I take it you're the manager.
- Sure I am the manager of this hotel.
Fortunately I'm accustomed to squalor. Tell me. Who's complaining?
- This young English lady underneath.
- Well, you tell the young English lady underneath... that I am putting on record for the benefit of mankind... one of the lost folk dances of Central Europe... and furthermore, she does not own this hotel.
But, sir, don't you understand?
Now, one, two -
You know what he said?
"Who she think she is? The queen of Sheba?
She think she owns this hotel?"
- Well, can't you get rid of him?
- Impossible.
- Are you sure?
- Uh, I begin to wonder.
It's come back to me. I've got an idea.
You see, the German lady. She will call him up on the telephone.
She say, "Young man. It's my room.
I did pay for it. Get out quickly."
- How's that, huh?
- Good enough.
We'll eject him with a little -
He'll never forget as long as he live.
Nothing but baseball.
You know. We used to call it rounders.
Children play it with a rubber ball and with a stick.
Not a word about cricket.
Americans got no sense of proportion.
Come in.
I can't stand this ridiculous lack of privacy. Lock the door.
Oh!
Who are you? What do you want?
- Recognize the signature tune?
- Will you please get out.
Oh, this is a much better room.
Definitely an acceptable room.
What exactly do you think you're doing?
Keep away.
Would you hold those for a minute?
Put those back at once.
- Now, which side do you like to sleep?
- Do you want me to throw you out?
Oh, in that case, I'Il sleep in the middle.
Smart of you to bribe the manager.
An eye for an eye... and a tooth for a toothbrush.
I suppose you realize you're behaving like a complete cad.
On the contrary, you're perfectly at liberty to sleep in the corridor if you want to.
Hello.
Oh, I shouldn't if I were you.
I'd only tell everyone you invited me here.
And when I say everyone, I mean everyone.
And I have a powerful voice.
- Come out of there at once!
- Not until you bribe the manager to restore me to my attic.
Come out of that bathroom!
Hello. Boris?
Look. I was thinking. I
- I might change my mind about that room upstairs if -
Oh, by the way, you might have my things taken upstairs.
You're the most contemptible person I've ever met in all my life!
Well, confidentially, I think you're a bit of a stinker too.
Well, if we get to Bâle on time, we should see the last day of the match.
I hope the weather's like this in Manchester.
Perfect wicket for our fellas.
We're somewhere along here.
If you don't hurry, Margaret, we shan't get that compartment to ourselves.
Does it matter?
Well, there's still time to change your mind, Iris.
Yes. Why not send Charles a greetings telegram and tell him he's all washed up?
No. It's too late. This time next week...
I shall be a slightly sunburnt offering on an altar in Hanover Square.
I shan't mind, really.
Oh! Good morning.
I can't find my bag.
It's a brown holdall, you know. Have you seen -
No. Of course not. Uh, thank you.
Well, I gave it to the porter. I can't imagine what happened.
Oh, she dropped her glasses.
- Say, you dropped your glasses. - Oh.
Thank you, my dear.
- Oh! - Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!
- Darling, are you hurt?
- Oh!
I don't know. What was it?
Never mind about that.
This cockeyed station of yours has practically brained my friend.
- Yes indeed!
- Well, what are you going to do about it?
- He says he cannot hold the train.
- I like that!
Hurry up! It's going.
- Yes, my dear.
- I'Il be all right.
- Are you sure? - Be careful now.
Careful.
Don't worry. I'll look after her. Such carelessness.
You sure you're all right?
- Send us a copy of the Times.
- Write and tell us all about it.
Good luck. Look after yourself.
There, there. You'll be all right in a minute.
Just take everything quietly.
Put some of this eau de cologne on your head.
- Do you feel any better?
- Yes, thank you. I'm all right now.
What you need is a good, strong cup of tea.
- I'll ring for the attendant. - No, no.
Please don't bother.
I'll go to the dining car myself. I need some air.
Oh, well, in that case, I'll come with you. If you don't mind, that is.
No, of course not.
Ah -
Oh! I - I beg your pardon.
You can always tell a honeymoon couple, you know. They're so shy.
- Why did you do that?
- Well, we don't want people staring at us.
Anyone would think the whole legal profession were dogging you.
- Oh, one would be enough.
- You even thought that beggar in Damascus was a barrister in disguise.
I merely said his face was distinguished enough for a judge.
You hurried off in the opposite direction, I noticed.
That's not true. I was looking for a street called "Straight."
- You weren't so careful the first few days.
- I know. I know.
And anyway, as for you meeting someone you know, what about me?
Robert thinks I'm cruising with Mother.
If one's feeling a little bit shaky, I always think it's best to sit in the middle of the coach.
Preferably facing the engine. Uh, a pot of tea for two, please.
- Very good.
- Oh, and - and just a minute.
Will you please tell them to make it from this?
I don't drink any other.
Uh, and - and make absolutely sure that the water is really boiling.
You understand?
It's a little fad of mine.
My dear father and mother... who I'm thankful to say are still alive... and enjoying good health, invariably drink it.
And so I follow their footsteps.
Do you know a million Mexicans drink it?
At least that's what it says on the packet.
It's very kind of you to help me like this.
I don't think we've introduced ourselves.
My name's Iris Henderson. I'm going home to be married.
Really? Oh, how very exciting.
- I do hope you'Il be happy.
- Thank you.
You'Il have children, won't you? They make such a difference.
I always think it's being with kiddies so much that's made me - if I may say so - young for my age.
I'm a governess, you know. My name's Froy.
Did you say Freud?
No. O-Y. Not E-U-D.
- Froy.
- I'm sorry. I can't hear.
Froy. It rhymes with "joy."
Thank you. Uh, please reserve two places for lunch, will you?
- That is if you'd care to have it with me.
- Of course.
There's nothing moot about it. It simply wasn't out. That's all.
But for the umpire's blunder, he'd probably still be batting.
- What do you mean? I don't understand.
- I'll show you. Look here.
I saw the whole thing.
There. Now then. There's Hammond.
There's the bowler. There's the umpire.
- Sugar?
- Two, please.
Dear me. There is no sugar.
Now watch this very, very carefully, Caldicott.
- Grimmett was bowling.
- May I trouble you for the sugar, please?
- What?
- The sugar, please.
Thank you so much.
If I were you, I'd try and get a little sleep.
It'll make you feel quite well again.
There's a most intriguing acrostic in The Needlewoman.
I'm going to try and unravel it before you wake up.
Reservations for lunch, please.
- Madame has booked for lunch?
- Oh, I think my friend did. She's got the tickets.
- Have you seen my friend?
- No.
Um, my friend. Where is she?
La signora inglese. The English lady. Where is she?
There has been no English lady here.
- What?
- There has been no English lady here.
There has. She sat there in the corner.
You saw her. You spoke to her. She sat next to you.
But it's ridiculous.
She took me to the dining car and came back here with me.
You went and came back alone.
Maybe you don't understand.
I mean the lady who looked after me when I was knocked out.
Ah. Perhaps it make you forget, eh?
Well, I may be very dense, but if this is some sort of a joke, I'm afraid I don't see the point.
- Oh, steward, you served me tea just now.
- Yes, madame.
- Have you seen the lady I was with? The English lady.
- But madame was alone.
- Pardon, madame. He make mistake.
- Well, of course.
He must remember the little English lady.
She ordered the tea and paid for it.
No. It is you who paid.
He say to look at the bill. I will look, madame.
But she gave you a special packet of tea. You can't have forgotten that.
The tea was ours, madame. I received no packet.
- But you did. I know what happened.
- Pardon, madame. The bill.
- Uh, tea for one.
- But that's not right.
Perhaps madame would care to examine the bills herself.
No, I wouldn't. The whole thing's too absurd.
Please, have you seen a lady pass through -
- Oh.
- Well, well. If it isn't old stinker.
If I thought you were going to be on this train, I'd have stayed another week in the hotel.
- Uh, lady? No. Why.
- It doesn't matter.
You probably wouldn't recognize one anyway.
Hello. Feeling queer?
It's that pipe of yours, George.
Why don't you throw your old socks away?
Never mind. Thanks for the help all the same.
Come on. Sit down. Take it easy.
- What's the trouble?
- If you must know, something fell on my head.
- When? Infancy?
- At the station.
- Oh. Bad luck. Can I help?
- No. Only by going away.
No, no, no.
My father always taught me never desert a lady in trouble.
He even carried that as far as marrying Mother.
I say, did you see a little lady last night in the hotel?
I only saw one little lady. She was hardly in tweeds.
But she was in my compartment, and now I can't find her.
She must be still on the train. We haven't stopped since we started.
- Of course she's still on the train. I know that.
- all right. Nobody said she isn't.
- Yes, but that's just what they are saying.
- Who?
The rest of the people in the compartment and the stewards.
They insist they never saw her.
- All of them?
- all of them.
- You were saying you got a knock on the head?
- What do you mean?
- Never mind. Do you talk the lingo?
- No.
Well, they probably thought you were trying to borrow some money.
Come on. Let's knock the idea out of their stupid heads.
A most unfortunate remark. I beg your pardon.
That's one of them. The little dark man.
I say. Excuse me. I think there's been a little misunderstanding.
- This young lady seems to have lost her friend.
- Yes. I have heard.
- This gentleman has been explaining to me.
- Ah.
Most interesting.
And I think under the circumstances, we shall all introduce ourselves.
- I am Italian citizen. My wife and child.
- How do you do?
- Oh, bonny little chap.
How old is he? - 1934 class.
- Ah. - Sì.
And the lady in the corner is the Baroness Atona.
Oh, yes. I met her husband.
He presented prizes at the folk dance festival. Minister of propaganda.
And I am Dr. Egon Hartz of Prague. You may have heard of me.
- Not the brain specialist?
- Yes. The same.
You flew over to England the other day and operated on one of our cabinet ministers.
- Oh, yes.
- Tell me. Did you find anything?
- A slight cerebral contusion.
- Oh, well, that's better than nothing.
But I am picking up a similar case at the next station, but so much more complicated.
I shall operate at the national hospital tonight.
Among other things, a cranial fracture with compression.
- Do you understand?
- Oh, yes. A wallop on the bean.
- I suppose you haven't seen my friend.
- Unfortunately, no.
I'll just take a word with the baroness.
Uh -
No.
- What do they say?
- Well, they both say they've never seen her.
But that's not true. She was sitting where you are.
- Can you describe her?
- Well, it's a bit difficult.
You see, she was sort of middle-aged and ordinary.
- Well, what was she wearing?
- Tweeds, oatmeal flecked with brown... a three-quarter coat with patch pockets... a scarf, a felt hat, brown shoes... a tussah shirt and - and a small blue handkerchief in her breast pocket.
- I can't remember any more.
- You couldn't have been paying attention.
- Now listen. You both went along to tea.
- Yes.
- Well, surely you met somebody.
- I suppose we did, but -
Wait a moment. Let me think.
Oh, yes. There was an Englishman who passed the sugar.
Right you are. Let's go along and dig him out.
Pardon me. I'll come with you. This is most interesting to me.
Well, we don't like people muscling in, but we'Il make you a member.
Wait a moment. There was somebody else.
As we passed this compartment, Miss Froy stumbled in.
There was a tall gentleman and a lady.
Now we're getting somewhere.
If we can find someone who saw her, we'Il have the place searched.
- Can I be of any assistance?
- That's the gentleman.
Do you happen to remember seeing this young lady pass the compartment with a little Englishwoman?
I'm, uh - I'm afraid not.
But you must have. She almost fell into your compartment.
Surely you haven't forgotten. It's very important.
Everybody's saying she wasn't on the train, but I know she is... and I'm going to find her even if I have to stop the train to do it.
Caldicott. This is Charters. Can I come in?
You know that girl we saw at the hotel?
She's back there kicking up a devil of a fuss.
- Says she's lost her friend.
- Well, she hasn't been in here, old man.
- But the point is she threatens to stop the train.
- Oh, Lord.
If we miss our connection in Bâle, we'll never make Manchester in time.
- This is serious.
- Let's hide in here.
I'm sorry. I haven't the faintest recollection.
You must be making a mistake.
Well, he obviously doesn't remember.
Let's go and look for the other fellow.
- Who were you talking to outside?
- Hmm?
Oh, nobody. Just, uh, some people in the corridor arguing.
There he is. That's the man.
I say. I'm so sorry. I wonder if I can bother you.
- I wonder if you can help us.
- How?
I was having tea about an hour ago with an English lady.
You saw her, didn't you?
- I don't know. I mean, definitely. I was talking to my friend.
Wasn't I? - Indubitably.
But you were sitting at the next table. She turned and borrowed the sugar.
You must remember.
- I recall passing the sugar.
- Then you saw her.
I repeat. We were deep in conversation. We were discussing cricket.
I don't see how a thing like cricket can make you forget seeing people.
Oh, don't you?
If that's your attitude, obviously there's nothing more to be said.
Come, Caldicott.
- "A thing like cricket."
- Hmm.
Wrong tactics. We should have told him we were looking for a lost cricket ball.
But he spoke to her. There must be some explanation.
There is. Please forgive me.
I'm quite possibly wrong... but I have known cases where a sudden shock or blow... has induced the most vivid impressions.
I understand. You don't believe me.
Oh, it's not a question of belief.
Even a simple concussion may have curious effects upon an imaginative person.
Yes, but I can remember every little detail.
Her name - Miss Froy. Everything.
So interesting.
You know, if one had time, one could trace the cause of the hallucination.
- Hallucination.
- Oh, precisely.
There is no Miss Froy. There never was a Miss Froy.
Merely a vivid subjective image.
- But I met her last night at the hotel.
- You thought you did.
- Yes, but what about the name?
- Oh, some past association.
An advertisement or a character in a novel, subconsciously remembered.
There is no reason to be frightened... if you are quiet and relaxed.
Thank you very much.
Dravka.
If you will excuse me, this is where my patient comes aboard. Excuse me.
Most interesting.
We're stopping.
- This is the first stop, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.
Then Miss Froy must still be on the train.
Look. You look out of this window and see if she gets off this side.
I'll take the other.
- Most interesting.
- Oh.
What was she dressed in? Scotch tweeds, wasn't it?
Oatmeal tweeds.
Oh, I knew it had something to do with porridge.
How long does it take to get a divorce?
- Eric. - Hmm?
Oh, I beg your pardon. I wasn't listening.
- I said, "How long does it take to get a divorce?"
- Oh, that depends. Why?
I was only wondering whether we could take our honeymoon next spring.
I mean the official one.
The difficulties are considerable.
For one thing, the courts are very crowded just now.
Although I suppose we barristers ought not to complain about that.
As a matter of fact, with the - with conditions as they are now, my chances of becoming a judge are very rosy.
That is, if, uh, nothing untoward occurs.
Such as you being mixed up in a divorce case yourself.
Uh, yes.
In that first careless rapture of yours you said you didn't care what happened.
My dear, you must think of it from my point of view.
The law, like Caesar's wife, must be above suspicion.
Even when the law spends six weeks with Caesar's wife?
- Look here.
- Now I know why you've been running around like a scared rabbit.
Why you lied so deliberately a few minutes ago.
- I lied? - Yes.
To those people in the corridor.
I heard every word you said.
It was merely that I didn't wish to be mixed up in any inquiry.
Inquiry. Just because a little woman can't be found -
That girl was making a fuss.
If the woman had disappeared... and I'd admitted having seen her, we might become vital witnesses.
My name might even appear in the papers, coupled with yours.
Why, a scandal like that might lead anywhere.
Anywhere.
Yes. I suppose it might.
- Nobody?
- Nobody.
Well, the only thing that came out my side was two bits of orange peel and a paper bag.
I know there's a Miss Froy. She's as real as you are.
That's what you say, and you believe it, but there doesn't appear to be anybody else who's seen her.
I saw her, I think.
- You did?
- A little woman in tweeds.
- Yes?
- Wearing a three-quarter coat?
- With a scarf? - That's right.
I saw her with you when you passed the compartment.
I knew I was right. But your husband said he hadn't seen her.
Oh, he didn't notice.
But as soon as he mentioned it, I remembered at once.
You win. You know, this calls for action.
Are you prepared to make a statement?
- Of course. If it helps.
- Ah. Pardon.
My patient has just arrived. The most fascinating complication.
We've some news for you. This lady actually saw Miss Froy.
- So - - We're going to have the train searched.
- You'll have to think of a fresh theory now, Doctor.
- It is not necessary.
My theory was a perfectly good one. The facts were misleading.
I hope you will find your friend. Excuse me.
- I'll be in here if you want me. - Right you are.
Come along.
Eric.
I was only going to mention that I told that girl I'd seen her friend.
What's that? Have you taken leave of your senses?
- On the contrary, I've come to them.
- What do you mean?
If there's a scandal, there'd be a divorce.
You couldn't let me down, could you?
You'd have to do the decent thing as reluctantly as only you know how.
You forget one very important thing, Margaret.
Your husband would divorce you. I've no doubt.
But whatever happens, my wife will never divorce me.
It may seem crazy to you, but I tell you.
You're going to search the train.
Ah! Signorina. Down there they look for you.
- Your friend. She come back.
- Come back?
- Sì. Sì.
- But what happened?
Oh. You go see. She tell you.
Thanks. All right, Athelstan. Relax.
The crisis is over.
Come on. Let's join the lady.
- Here we are.
- Miss Froy.
That isn't Miss Froy.
- Isn't it?
- No.
I say, it's a silly thing to say, but are you Miss Froy?
No. I am Madame Kummer.
She says she helped you into the carriage after you got the biff on the head, then went to see friends.
The baroness says that as you spoke about an English lady, she didn't connect her with Madame Kummer.
But she wasn't the lady I saw. It was Miss Froy.
Oatmeal tweeds, blouse, blue silk handkerchief.
Yes. Yes, I know.
Everything's the same, but it isn't her.
I beg your pardon.
When did you say you first met this Miss Froy?
- Last night at the hotel.
- Oh. And was she wearing a costume like this?
- Yes. I think so.
- Then I must apologize.
- You did meet her after all.
- Then -
But not on this train.
In your subconscious mind... you substituted for the face of Madame Kummer that of Miss Froy.
But I didn't.
I couldn't have, I tell you. I talked to her here.
That's very easily settled.
There's an Englishwoman who said she saw her.
If this lady wouldn't mind - Madame -
Bon.
Après vous, mesdames. What a gift for languages a fellow's got.
I'm so sorry.
Would you tell us, please, is this the woman you saw?
It isn't a bit like her, is it?
Yes, she's the woman.
- But it isn't, I tell you. It isn't.
- Are you sure?
- Perfectly.
- She isn't. She isn't.
Well, come on, then. I'm so sorry to have troubled you.
Well, aren't you going to say anything?
You might at least gloat, if nothing else.
What am I expected to say? You only did it to save your own skin.
She was lying. I saw it in her face.
They're all lying, but why? Why?
Now, why don't you sit down and take it easy?
Do you believe this nonsense about substituting Miss Froy's face for Madame Kummer's?
Well, I think any change would be an improvement.
Listen, Miss Froy was on this train.
I know she was, and nothing will convince me otherwise.
Must you follow me round like a pet dog?
Oh. Well, let's say a watchdog. I've got all the better instincts.
Good-bye.
The doctor was right. You're all right.
I never saw Miss Froy on the train.
- It didn't happen. I know now.
- I'm glad you're gonna take it like that.
What you want to do is to forget all about it.
Just make your mind a complete blank.
You know? Watch me. You can't go wrong.
Well, what about a spot of something to eat, huh?
- Anything. - That's right.
Come along.
Ah.
- Oh. Would you like a little air?
- Thanks.
- Well. Do you think you can eat anything?
- I could try.
That's the spirit.
You'Il feel a different girl tomorrow.
I hope so.
I don't want to meet my fiancé a nervous wreck.
- Your... what?
- I'm being married on Thursday.
Quite sure you're not imagining that?
- Positive.
- Oh, I was afraid so.
- Ah, food.
- I couldn't face it.
- Well, you know best. You mind if I talk with my mouth full?
- If you must.
Well, now. Would you like to hear about my early life?
- I don't think so.
- Well, since you pressed me, I'Il begin with my father.
You know, it's remarkable how many great men began with their father -
- Oh, something to drink?
- No, I -
Oh, yes, I will. A cup of tea, please.
You know, my father was a very colorful character.
Amongst other things, he was strongly addicted to
- You'Il never guess.
- Harriman's Herbal Tea.
- No, wrong. Double scotch.
- A million Mexicans drink it.
- Maybe they do, but Father didn't.
- Miss Froy gave the waiter a packet of it.
- Packet of what?
Harriman's Herbal Tea.
She said it was the only sort she liked.
I thought we'd agree that you were going to make your mind a complete blank.
But it's so real. I'm sure it happened.
- Did we, or did we not?
- We did.
Sorry. Go on telling me about your father.
Well, my father was a very remarkable man.
- Did he play the clarionet?
- Incessantly.
In fact, he never put it down, unless, uh - unless it became absolutely necessary.
Well, naturally I couldn't help inheriting his love of music.
- Why not?
- It was all he left me.
You know, you're remarkably attractive.
Has anyone ever told you?
We were discussing you.
- Yes, of course. Um, do you like me?
- Not much.
Well, after I'd, uh, paid my father's debts...
I started to travel, until they tried to cash the checks.
At the moment, you know, I'm writing a book on folk dancing.
Would you like to buy a copy?
I'd love to. When does it see the light of day?
Hmm, about four years.
- That's a very long time.
- Very long book.
Do you know why you fascinate me?
I'Il tell you.
You've got two great qualities I used to admire in Father.
You haven't any manners at all, and... you're always seeing things.
- Now what's the matter?
- Look.
- It's gone!
- What's gone?
Miss Froy's name on the window.
You saw it. You must have seen it! She's on the train!
Now steady, steady.
- Excuse me. Thank you. It's okay.
- No, no! We've got to find her. Something's happening to her!
- Now -
- Stop the train!
Listen, everybody.
There's a woman on this train - Miss Froy.
Some of you must have seen her. They're hiding her somewhere.
I appeal to you, all of you, to stop the train.
- Now, listen - - Please help me. Please make them stop the train.
- Come on.
- Do you hear? Why don't you do something before it's too late?
- Please. Please.
- I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not! I'm not!
- For heaven's sake, stop this train!
- Now, come -
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!
Huh. Ten minutes late, thanks to that fool of a girl.
She gets up to any more of her tricks, we shall be too late for the last day of the match.
I suppose you couldn't put it to her in some way.
- What?
- Well, people... just don't vanish and so forth.
- She has.
- What?
Vanished.
- Who?
- The old dame.
- Yes.
- Well?
- Well, how could she?
- What?
- Vanish.
- I don't know.
That just explains my point.
People don't just disappear into thin air.
It's done in India.
- What?
- The rope trick.
Oh, that? It never comes out in a photograph.
Look, now. In half an hour we'll stop at Morsken, just before the border.
I will leave there, with my patient, for the national hospital.
If you will come with me, you could stay overnight in a private ward.
- You need peace and rest.
- Sorry. Nothing doing.
Isn't there anything we can do?
Yes, find Miss Froy.
I tell you, my friend.
If she does not rest, I will not answer for her.
It will be best if you persuade her. She likes you.
Oh, I'm just about as popular as a dose of strychnine.
If you coat it with sugar, she may swallow it.
Cosmopolitan train, this. People of all nations.
I've just seen at least a million Mexicans in the corridor.
Well, I thought I'd look in to tell you to think over what Dr. Hartz said.
Feel like changing your mind, I'll be hanging around.
- What's all the mystery?
- You're right. Miss Froy is on this train.
I've just seen the packet of tea that you were talking about.
They chucked it out with the rubbish.
- Trifle late, aren't you? She may be dead by now.
- Well, dead or -
Of course, for sheer variety, give me an English summer.
I remember once spending a bank holiday at Brighton -
We're going to search this train.
There's something definitely queer in here.
- Looks like supply service for trunk murderers.
- Don't!
Look at that.
- All right, Miss Froy. It's only us.
- Hurry up. Quickly.
Well, perhaps it's Miss Froy bewitched. You never know.
Well, anyway, I refuse to be discouraged.
Faint heart never found old lady.
By the way, do you know anything about her?
No. Only that she was a governess going back home.
Mm-hmm.
- What is this thing?
- Can't imagine.
Anyway, there might be something down here.
- What on earth?
- Our Italian friend, that -
I've got it. Wait a minute.
There you are. The Great Doppo.
- His visiting card. Look.
- What's it say?
"The Great Doppo - magician, illusionist, mind reader -
"will visit all the principal towns and cities.
See his, uh, fascinating act, The Vanishing L - Lady."
- Vanishing Lady?
- Perhaps that's the explanation.
- What?
- Maybe he's practicing on Miss Froy.
Well, perhaps it's a publicity stunt.
No, I don't think so.
That wouldn't account for the baroness or Madame Kummer.
- Well, what's your theory?
- Oh, I don't know. My theory? I'll tell you.
Oh, dear.
I can't get one -
That one - Where are you?
I'm in here, with a strong smell of camphor ball.
- I can't see you.
- I'm about somewhere.
Here I am. Where are you?
- I don't know.
- Ah, this is what comes of not saying "Abracadabra."
- Ooh! Oh!
- Are you hurt?
- Ouch.
- Come on. Out with it, Oscar.
- Not much.
- Come sit down over here.
- What is that thing?
- Well, in magic circles we call it the disappearing cabinet.
- You get inside and vanish.
- Mmm. So I noticed.
- You were about to tell me of your theory.
- Oh, my theory. Well -
My theory, my dear Watson, is that we are in very deep waters indeed.
- Ahem. - Oh.
Thank you very much.
Let us marshal our facts over a pipeful of Baker Street shag.
In the first place, a little old lady disappears.
Everyone that saw her promptly insists that she was never there at all.
- Right?
- Right.
We know that she was.
Therefore they did see her. Therefore they are deliberately lying.
- Why?
- I don't know. I'm only Watson.
Well, don't bury yourself in the part. I'll tell you why.
Because they daren't face an inquiry.
Because Miss Froy is probably still somewhere on this train.
- I told you that hours ago.
- Oh, yes. So you did.
- For that, my dear Watson, you shall have a trichinopoly cigar.
- Oh, thank you.
Now there's only one thing left to do, you know - search the train in disguise.
- As what?
- Well -
- Old English gentleman.
- They'd see through you.
Perhaps you're right. Aha!
Will Hay, for instance.
Now... boys, boys.
Which of you has stolen Miss Froy? Own up. Own up.
- Those glasses, give them to me.
- They're Miss Froy's.
- You sure?
Yes, they're exactly the same. Gold rim with -
- Where did you find these?
- Well, down here on the floor. The glass is broken.
- Well, probably in the struggle.
Quick. - Pick up the glass.
You realize this is our first piece of really tangible proof?
That's the last.
Will you please give me those spectacles? They belong to me.
- My spectacles, please!
- Yours? Are you sure?
Ah, naughty, naughty.
You know, that's a very large nose for a very small pair of spectacles.
That's the game, is it? Let's see about that!
Those are Miss Froy's glasses, and you know it.
She's been in here, and you know that too.
Don't stand hopping about like a referee. Cooperate.
Kick him. See if he's got a false bottom.
Wait a minute. I'Il get him up.
Ow! That doesn't help!
Quick! Pull his ears back!
Give 'em a twist. Yeah. That's it.
Look out. He's got a knife!
Quick. Get a hold of it before he cuts a slice off me.
I can't reach it.
Will you -
Well done. That's it.
We know how that thing works. Come out of there.
Is he out, do you think?
Anyway, we've gotta hide him somewhere.
What's in here?
Hurry up quick, before he comes to.
It's empty. Bring him along.
Come on.
Oh, no, you don't.
- Oh. - What's the matter?
Garlic. I'll be all right in a minute.
- Here. Hold on to this.
- Oh, yes.
Let's tie him up. Oh, well. We're getting somewhere at last.
We definitely know that Miss Froy was on this train... and we know our friend here had something to do with it.
That ought to keep him quiet until we find her.
Ah. Hard work, but worth it.
- Uh, let's have the evidence.
- Evidence?
- Yes, the glasses.
- You've got them.
No, I haven't got them.
- Oh.
- He's got them.
- He isn't there!
- Well -
Snookered. It's a false bottom.
That twister. He's a contortionist.
- He's gone, all right.
- Yes, to find the others and make more trouble.
We're in a nasty jam, my dear.
- We can't fight the whole train. We need allies.
- Yes, but who can we trust?
- That's the snag.
- There's that Dr. Hartz person.
Yes, you're right. He might help. Come along.
Let's tell him the symptoms.
All right. Oh, wait a minute.
This is the one.
Oh. He's not there.
Listen. I've just had a particularly idiotic idea.
- Mmm. I quite believe that.
- But suppose that patient in there is Miss Froy.
Yes, but it didn't come on the train till after Miss Froy disappeared.
Oh, yes. Yes, that's why it's an idiotic idea.
- Come on. Let's find the doctor.
- No, no, no. Wait a minute.
- What is it?
- Did you notice anything wrong about that nun?
- No.
- I don't think she's a nun at all.
They don't wear high heels.
Yes, you're right. Listen. Did you see Madame Kummer get on the train?
- No.
- Well, supposing they decoyed Miss Froy into the luggage van and hid her there.
The first stop, the patient comes aboard - head injury, all wrapped up.
The patient is Madame Kummer. Madame Kummer becomes Miss Froy and Miss Froy becomes... that.
Yes, but why should they go to all this trouble to kidnap a harmless little governess?
Perhaps it isn't a governess at all.
Perhaps it's some political thing, you know?
Well, let's investigate.
Parlez-vous français?
Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
Well, you'll just have to put up with it in English.
Can we take a look at your patient, please?
Thank you. Keep an eye on the nun.
What are you doing here?
Why are you in here? This is the most serious accident case.
You have no business to be here at all, neither of you.
Dr. Hartz, we want you to undo those bandages and let us take a look at your patient's face.
Are you out of your senses? There is no face there.
Nothing but lumps of raw flesh.
Already the case has lost so much blood, nothing but a transfusion can save him.
What do you want me to do? Murder my patient?
You're quite sure that this is your patient?
We believe it's Miss Froy.
Miss Froy? You can't be serious.
Whatever put such ideas into your heads?
I understand she's deaf and dumb.
- But she may lip-read.
- Oh, well, that's possible.
Well, in that case, perhaps you will join me in the dining car?
I'Il be with you in a moment.
I want to be certain my patient hasn't been disturbed.
How the devil do I know how they cottoned on?
Somebody must have tipped them off.
You never said the old girl was English.
What difference does that make?
In a few moments, I shall order three drinks in the dining car.
Mine will be Chartreuse.
Now, one of the stewards is working for us. Now listen carefully.
There's that girl again.
Seems to have recovered. Lucky it blew over.
And now, perhaps, you'll tell me what's all about.
Now listen, Doctor.
Have you ever actually seen your patient?
No, I merely received a message to pick the case up and operate at Morsken.
- How do you know that it's not Miss Froy?
- We believe there's been a substitution, Doctor.
- You really mean to say that you think that someone -
- Um, um -
Oh. Uh, I want a green Chartreuse.
- Won't you join me?
- Oh, thanks. I'd like a large brandy.
- And you?
- Oh, I don't want anything.
- Oh, come on. It'Il do you good.
- No, really. I don't want it.
You're very tired. It will pick you up.
All right, then. Just a small one.
Uh, two brandies and a Chartreuse.
Tell me, do you know anything about the nun who's looking after your patient?
Nun? No.
Only that she is from a convent close to where the accident occurred.
Don't you think it's rather peculiar that she's wearing high-heeled shoes?
Oh, is she?
Well, that is rather - rather curious, isn't it?
It's a conspiracy. That's all it can be.
all these people on the train say they haven't seen Miss Froy, but they have.
We know that, because just now in the luggage van -
- She's off again.
- Hope she doesn't create another scene.
Put the lid on our getting back in time, if she did.
And then this fellow from the carriage - Doppo's his name -
He came along and grabbed the glasses.
Yeah. We went for him and had a bit of a fight.
- Oh, a fight?
- Mm-hmm.
- We knocked him out.
- Oh.
Shh!
- He seems to have made a speedy recovery.
- Yes. All that's just bluff.
Here.
Oh, but how could he be involved in a conspiracy?
Look at him, the poor fellow. He's just a harmless traveler.
He's also a music hall artist making a tour of Bandrika.
- Well?
- Well, the baroness's husband is minister of propaganda.
One word from her and his tour would be canceled.
- Oh, I see.
- As for the stewards, if they don't do what they're told... they've got a nice cozy brick wall to lean up against.
Well, that's just what stumps us, but all we know is that she was here on this train... and now she's... gone. But - But
- Tell me about... the two English travelers. They-They also denied seeing her.
Yes. Just British diplomacy, Doctor.
"Never climb a fence if you can sit on it." It's an old Foreign Office proverb.
What I cannot understand is, why should anyone want to dispose of the old lady?
Yes.
Well, if you're right, it means the whole train is against us.
Well, what are we going to do?
Well, in view of what you just told me, l-l-l shall risk examining the patient.
- Come on.
- Wait a minute, however -
But one moment. Uh, we mustn't act suspicious.
Behave as if nothing had happened.
Drink. That'Il steady your nerves.
To our health... and may our enemies, if they exist, be unconscious of our purpose.
Let's go. We must hurry now.
Come on. Drink up.
Wait in here.
There you are.
- Anything wrong?
- Nothing... except they noticed you were wearing high heels.
However, it makes no difference.
We shall reach Morsken in three minutes.
Quite an eventful journey.
- Well?
- Yes. The patient is Miss Froy.
She will be taken off the train at Morsken, in about three minutes.
She will be removed to the hospital there and operated on.
Unfortunately, the operation will not be successful.
Oh, I should perhaps have explained.
The operation will be performed... by me.
Hmm.
You see, I am in this, uh, conspiracy, as you term it.
You are a very alert young couple... but it's quite useless for you to think, as you are undoubtedly doing, of a way out of your dilemma.
The drinks you had just now, I regret to say, contained a quantity of Hydrocin.
For your benefit, Hydrocin is a very little-known drug... which has the effect, in a small quantity, of paralyzing the brain... and rendering the victim unconscious for a considerable period.
In a slightly larger quantity, of course, it induces madness.
However, you have my word the dose was a normal one.
In a very few moments now, you will join your young friend.
Need I say how sorry I am, having to take such a -
How shall I say - melodramatic course?
But your persistent meddling made it necessary.
- You all right? You must have fainted.
- Did I?
Listen.
There's a woman next door going to be murdered... and we've got to get moving before this stuff takes effect.
Well, uh
- I did read once that if you keep on the go, you can stay awake.
Right. Come on. Let's get going.
It's locked.
We can't go that way. We'd be spotted.
- You can't do that!
- Don't worry. It's only next door.
You carry on keeping fit - uh, touch your toes, stand on your head.
Do anything, only whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Go on. You needn't be afraid. It is Miss Froy.
It's all right. You haven't been drugged.
He told me to put something in your drink, but I didn't do it.
What the devil are you? He said you were deaf and dumb.
Oh, never mind about that now. If you want to save her, you've got to hurry.
Hartz will be back in a minute. What's gonna happen then?
If we can hold them off till we get past Morsken... the frontier's a few miles beyond the station.
Here. No, come on. There's still time.
That's Morsken. You finished?
Come on, Miss Froy.
- Oh!
- Cut it out, kid. You're not drugged. I'Il explain later.
- Abracadabra.
- Miss Froy!
- Oh.
- Oh, I can't believe it!
- Thank you, my dear. Thank you very much.
- Careful!
- Ready?
- Yes.
- You all right, Miss Froy?
- Yes, thank you.
It's rather like the rush hour on the underground.
Look. We're slowing down.
Look out.
I'm sorry you've had such an uncomfortable journey, Miss Froy.
Get back on the train.
I hope nothing goes wrong. Aren't we stopping rather a long time?
The ambulance is going. We'll be off in a jiffy.
Another couple of minutes, we'Il be over the border.
I know I've been well paid, and I've done plenty of dirty work for it... but this was murder and...
sh-she was an Englishwoman.
- You are Bandriekan?
- My husband was, but I'm English... and you were going to butcher her in cold blood.
Your little diversion made it necessary not only to remove the lady in question... but two others as well.
- You can't do that.
- Also, it would be unwise of us... to permit the existence of anyone who cannot be trusted.
- You wouldn't dare. I know too much.
- Precisely.
I think we're over the border now.
- You can come out, Miss Froy.
- Oh. Oh, bless me.
- What an unpleasant journey.
- Never mind.
- You shall have a corner seat for the rest of the way.
- Okay.
- Ah.
- There you are.
Okay.
Now that it's over, I think you ought to tell us what it's all about.
What was that scream?
- Surely it was only the train whistle.
- It wasn't. It was a woman.
Be careful.
They've rumbled.
We're on a branchline and they've slipped the rear part of the train.
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
- Look here.
Who are you... and why are these people going to these lengths to get hold of you?
I haven't the faintest idea. I - I'm a children's governess, you know.
I can only think they've made some terrible mistake.
Why are you holding out on us? Tell us the truth!
You got us involved in this fantastic plot, you might at least trust us.
I really don't know. I -
I wonder if there's anybody else left on the train.
Well, there's only the dining car in front, but there won't be anybody there now.
What do you make it? Teatime.
Well, all the English will be there. I'm going to take a look.
Come on. We'd better stick together.
There's the old girl turned up.
Told you it was a lot of fuss about nothing. Bolt must have jammed.
I've got something to say. Will you all please listen?
An attempt has been made to abduct this lady by force.
I've got reason to believe that the people who did it are going to try again.
- What's the fellow driveling about?
If you don't believe me, you can look out of the window.
This train's been diverted onto a branchline.
- What are you talking about? Abductions, diverted trains -
- We're telling you the truth!
I'm not in the least interested.
Y-You've annoyed us enough with your ridiculous story.
My dear chap, you must have got hold of the wrong end of the stick somewhere.
- Yes. Things like that just don't happen.
- We're not in England now.
- I don't see what difference that makes.
- We're stopping.
Do you see those cars? They're here to take Miss Froy away.
Nonsense. Look. There go a couple of people.
The cars have obviously come to pick them up.
In that case, why go to the trouble of uncoupling the train and diverting it?
- Uncoupling?
- There's nothing left of the train beyond the sleeping car.
- There must be. Our bags are in the first-class carriage.
- Not any longer.
- Would you like to come and look?
- If this is a practical joke, I warn you, I shan't think it very funny.
Good Lord!
Let's have some of that brandy.
- You don't suppose there's something in this, uh, fellow's story, Caldicott, do you?
I mean, after all, people don't go about tying up nuns.
Someone's coming!
They can't possibly do anything to us. We're British subjects.
I have come to offer the most sincere apologies.
An extremely serious incident has occurred.
An attempt has been made to interfere with passengers on this train.
Fortunately, it was brought to the notice of the authorities... and so if you will be good enough to accompany me to Morsken...
I will inform the British embassy at once.
Ladies and gentlemen, the cars are at your disposal.
We're very grateful. It's lucky some of you fellows understand English.
- Well, I was at Oxford.
- Really? So was I. What year?
Hold on. This woman seems to be trying to say something.
- I don't understand the language and it may be important.
Would you - - Certainly.
That's fixed him. That's all right. He's only stunned.
- What the blazes did you do that for?
- Well, I was at Cambridge.
What's that got to do with it? You heard what he said, didn't you?
I heard what she said. That was a trick to get us off the train.
I don't believe it. The man's explanation was quite satisfactory.
Thing like this might cause a war.
I'm going outside, tell them what's occurred.
- It's up to us to apologize and put the matter right.
- What? Look -
- You were right. Do you mind, old man?
- Certainly.
- Look as if they mean business.
- I'm afraid so.
- They can't do anything. It would mean an international situation.
- It's happened before.
- They're coming.
- Don't let them in! They'll murder us.
They daren't let us go now.
- I order you to surrender at once.
- Nothing doing. Come any nearer, I'll fire.
I've warned you.
Better take cover. They'Il start any minute now.
Nasty jam, this. Don't like the look of it.
- Got plenty of ammunition?
- Whole pouch full.
- Good.
- Duck down, you!
- I'm not gonna fight. It's madness.
- It'll be safer to protest down here.
Hello. They're trying to work round to the other side.
You're behaving like a pack of fools!
What chance have we got against a lot of armed men?
You heard what the mother superior said. We surrender now, we're in for it.
We'Il never get to the match now.
- Give it to me.
- No.
Give it to me!
- What's going on here?
- He's got a gun and he won't use it.
What's the idea?
- Well, I told you. I won't be a party to this sort of thing.
I don't believe in fighting!
- Pacifist, eh?
Won't work, old boy. Early Christians tried it and got thrown to the lions.
Come on. Hand it over.
I'm not afraid to use it.
Probably more used to it. I once won a box of cigars.
He's talking rot. He's a damn good shot.
Hope the old hand hasn't lost its cunning.
You know, I'm half inclined to believe... that there's some rational explanation to all this.
Rotten. Only knocked his hat off.
Do you mind if I talk to you for a minute?
- What, now? - Yes, I
- Please forgive me, but it's very important.
Hang on to this for me, will you?
- All right. I'll hold the fort.
- I think it's safer along here. You come too.
Keep your head low.
I just wanted to tell you... that I must be getting along now.
But you can't! You'll never get away. You'll be shot down.
I must take that risk. Listen carefully.
In case I'm unlucky and you get through...
I want you to take back a message to a Mr. Callendar at the Foreign Office in Whitehall.
- Then you are a spy.
- I always think that's such a grim word.
- Well, what is the message?
- It's a tune.
- Tune?
- It contains - in code, of course - the vital clause of a secret pact between two European countries.
- I want you to memorize it.
- Well, go ahead.
The first part of it goes like this -
Oh, perhaps I'd better write it down. Have you got a piece of paper?
No, don't bother. I was brought up on music. I can memorize anything.
Very well.
- Hello. The old girl's gone off her rocker.
- I don't wonder.
Why don't you face it? Those swine out there will go on firing till they've killed the lot of us.
For goodness' sake. Shut up, Eric.
That's right. Now we've got two chances instead of one.
- You bet.
- You sure you'll remember it?
Oh, don't worry. I won't stop whistling it.
- I suppose this is my best way out.
- Yes, just about.
But you may be hit, and even if you do get away, they'll stop you at the frontier.
- We can't let her go like this!
- This is a hell of a risk you're taking.
In this sort of job, one must take risks.
I'm very grateful to you both for all you've done.
I do hope and pray no harm will come to you... and that we shall all meet again...
- I hope so too. Good luck.
- Good luck.
Will you help me?
Yes. Right.
- Now you take the weight on this.
Yes. - Hold on.
- Hold your shirt.
- Right you are.
Good-bye.
- Was she hit?
- I'm not sure.
Well, that's the end of my 12.
There's not much left here either.
Listen. We've only got one chance now.
We've got to get this train going, drive it back to the main line and then try and cross the frontier.
That's a bit of a tall order, isn't it?
Those driver fellows are not likely to do as you tell them.
We'll bluff them with this.
- Who's coming?
- You can count on me.
- Me too.
Well, we can't all go. You stay here and carry on.
If we have any luck, we'll stop the train when we reach the points.
- You jump out and switch them over.
- Okay.
You idiots. You're just inviting death.
I've had enough.
Just because I have the sense to try and avoid being murdered, I'm accused of being a pacifist.
All right. I'd rather be called a rat than die like one.
Think for a moment, will you?
If we give ourselves up, they daren't murder us in cold blood.
- They're bound to give us a trial.
- Stop jibbering, Eric. Nobody's listening to you.
Very well. You go your way. I'Il go mine.
- Hey, where you off to?
- I know what I'm about.
- I'm doing the only sensible thing.
- Oh, let the fellow go if he wants to.
You don't understand. I'm -
No, please.
Why aren't we going? Why aren't we going?
They said we were going. Why aren't we?
If only he can get us away now. He must!
There's only one left. I'll keep that for a sitter.
They're moving away from the cars. They're coming towards us.
Pity we haven't a few more rounds.
It's funny.
I told my husband, when I left him, that I wouldn't see him again.
Gilbert. Gilbert!
- By gad, we're off.
- This gives us a chance.
Go on. Keep going.
I say. Do you know how to control this thing?
I watched the fellow start it. Anyway, I know something about it.
- Once drove a miniature engine on the Dymchurch line.
- Good. I'Il look out for the points.
The blighters are chasing us. Look.
We can't have far to go.
It's time for my little job changing the points.
Thank heavens we shall be in neutral territory.
That will not be necessary.
I'm sorry, but the points, as you call them, will not be changed over.
Will you please be seated.
- There they are, just ahead of us. Think you can stop it?
- Hope so.
Keep quite still until my friends arrive.
If anyone moves, I'm afraid I shall have to shoot.
There's just one thing you don't know, Captain.
There's only one bullet left in that gun, and if you shoot me, you'll give the others a chance.
You're in rather a difficult position, aren't you?
Sit down, please.
All right.
Where the devil's Charters?
Go ahead! She's done it.
Quick!
Oh!
It's all right. It's just my leg.
Or as they say in English, jolly good luck to them.
My word, I'm glad all that's over, aren't you?
Heaven knows what the government will say about all this.
- Nothing at all. They'll hush it up.
- What?
Hey, take your hand off that thing. I've got to remember a tune.
Remember?
Porter, sir?
Uh, no, thanks.
Well, we're home, Gilbert.
Can't you stop humming that awful tune? You must know it backwards.
I'm not taking any risks.
- Charles be here to meet you?
- I expect so.
♪♪ Well, you'll be pretty busy between now and Thursday.
I could meet you for lunch or dinner, if you'd like it.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. I -
No, as a matter of fact, I've got to deliver this theme song for Miss Froy.
When I've done that, I'm gonna dash off to Yorkshire and finish my book.
I see.
- Ready?
- Yes.
Ample time to catch the 6:50 to Manchester after all.
Yes.
- Any sign of Charles yet?
- No. I can't see him.
Well, this is where we say good-bye.
Oh, what's the matter?
Charles?
Yes, you heartless, callous, selfish, swollen-headed beast.
Are you going anywhere?
Foreign Office.
- Where are we going for our honeymoon?
- I don't know. Somewhere quiet.
Somewhere where there are no trains.
Mr. Callendar will see you now.
- Wait a minute. It's gone.
- What's gone?
- The tune. I've forgotten it.
- No. Oh, no!
Wait a minute. Let me concentrate.
No, no, no, no. That's "The Wedding March."
This is awful!
I've done nothing else but sing it since the day before yesterday, and - and now I've forgotten it completely.
- Miss Froy. - Well, I'll be had.
- Going to Le Havre?
- Yeah. get in.
Thanks.
Tired?
Yes.
Are you on leave?
You're not very talkative.
No, not very.
Cigarette?
Thanks.
We're here.
- Le Havre.
Ah, yes. Le Havre.
This is some fog!
I know all about fogs. I was in Tonkin.
You must be joking. It's not foggy in Tonkin.
Not foggy?
Yes, it is. In here.
Are you mad, swerving to save a dog?
- A dog's a dog. - And my bones are my bones.
Got yellow fever? Then take quinine. You might be in the army but I'm the boss in my truck.
Your truck, your bones!
If you don't like it, get out and I'll rattle those bones of yours.
All right, I will.
Are we really going to fight over a dog?
Don't think I'm chickening out.
I could easily take a hold of you and head-butt you.
So much for your spanner!
I only grabbed it in case you tried to shoot.
Shoot?
You don't know what you're talking about.
Give me a cigarette.
Shooting might look easy.
Like shooting clay pipes at the fair.
You shoot and then... a man screams
and grabs hold of his belly, making a face like... Like a kid who's eaten too much.
His hands turn red. Then he falls.
And you're left all alone, not understanding a thing.
It's as if the ground had fallen away.
Anyway... Thanks for the lift. Here.
No hard feelings?
Of course not.
- Bye. - Want the packet?
- What about you?
- I've got more.
Well, in that case... - Thanks.
- Bye.
Good luck.
It's a laugh a minute tonight.
- Will he be long?
- I don't know.
You never know anything.
Coming to dance, Lucien?
I told you to wait at the bar. We're talking.
I came here because you asked me to but I hate places like this.
I find this music so dreadful. I like classical music.
We know what kind of music you like, Zabel.
You know nothing. You're just petty crooks.
That's right, make us laugh. Act the fool.
Funny, isn't he?
Sure, if you say so.
You even make the orphan laugh. And he's not normally cheerful.
You make us laugh. It's a fact.
You can pretend to laugh but you should be ashamed of the life you lead.
Your parents are respectable people. But you lead the life of a gangster.
It's so demoralising.
And to think you learned to play the piano!
Listen, it's all very well acting the fool for five minutes, but enough's enough.
Where's Maurice?
Yes, good old Maurice!
No idea. He used to drop in once in a while.
But once I saw he was a crook like you,
I asked him to space out his visits. That's all.
This music!
Maurice has disappeared and since I've fallen out with him...
- Over a woman, no doubt. - That or something else.
Anyway, people think I'm involved.
And deep down that flatters you, right?
But you're worried it might cause you trouble so you'd like to know.
Precisely.
I'm sure you know a lot.
Yes, a lot!
You're wrong, my dears. I don't know a thing.
And don't get so familiar.
I'm old enough to be your father and I'm an honest merchant.
We're pretty rare these days.
You invited me here so I'll let you pay.
Madam, my hat and coat, please.
He makes fun of us and then off he goes!
Let him go.
We'll go and see him later.
What for?
Just to see.
I told you to get lost!
Can't you be polite?
I'm asking you how much the rooms cost?
You're dressed up like an admiral so you can help the customers.
Just tell me what the rooms cost.
I'm telling you, this is not a hotel! So you won't say what the rooms cost?
It's not for tonight because I'm skint.
But maybe tomorrow or another night I could...
Get lost or this could turn nasty!
- Sorry. - No harm done.
- What a brute! - Who? - The admiral.
- Leave me in peace. I'm in a hurry.
But it's not every night I meet a friend.
I don't love soldiers. I just feel sorry for them.
I might have been a soldier if I hadn't come a cropper the day I got called up.
- Are you going to leave me alone?
- Are you a brute too?
No, I just want to be left alone.
Now I see. I get it.
Do you have to be so clingy?
- Is that your dog?
If you're looking for a quiet spot, I might be able to help you.
The trouble is, I'm skint. That doesn't matter. I'll take you to Panama's.
- What's Panama's? - Panama's?
It's the quietest spot on the coast.
For a seaside resort, it's the best you can find.
Four walls, a door and a roof on top.
My dream is... If you dream standing up, you'll fall over.
Never mind.
Here we are. It's that place lit up over there.
My dream is to sleep just once between clean, white sheets.
A top sheet and a bottom sheet.
Your dog's back.
I told you, he's not mine.
Get lost, will you?
I've got no dog, nothing.
Don't you like dogs? Not one that's looking for a master.
Have you found a master?
Not yet.
- Who is it?
- Half Pint.
Open up. I'm not alone.
Come in.
Good evening.
Want a drink?
I'm not thirsty.
Besides, I can't afford a drink.
That doesn't matter. Make yourself at home.
But I'm warning you, don't try telling me some sob story about the fog, your troubles and your problems.
There's no fog here, only fair weather.
The hands are nailed down, so... any personal stuff...
Calm down. I'm not the talkative type.
Well, I am, but I'm discreet.
What do you think of this one?
It's a real one.
I bought it in Panama, in 1906.
It cuts America in half.
You cross it by boat and you're down below looking up at monkeys in the sky.
Blue monkeys. It's wonderful.
- Tired?
- A little.
Forgive me.
Tired or not, it's none of my business.
Usually, I never ask questions.
No harm done.
Leave that alone, you idiot!
The crew will come unglued.
You've already swallowed the cabin boy.
Panama, 1906.
32 years in the bottle and you want to gulp it down!
When I'm thirsty...
Hell, all I want is...
I know. To sleep in clean sheets.
- Hi, Panama. - Michel.
You've got a crowd in tonight.
Yeah, high society!
People are what they are.
Pretty awful, pretty criminal.
But there are pretty things too.
You should paint them.
Paint them?
I've tried painting flowers, young women, children...
It was like painting crime with all that entails.
I'd see crime in a rose.
It's called painting with a knife!
What could be simpler than a tree?
And yet when I paint one, I make everyone ill at ease.
There's always something or someone hidden behind the tree.
I paint things hidden behind other things.
To me, a swimmer is already a drowned man.
Whenever I try to paint gaiety, music, a dance or an outdoor wedding, on my canvas I find only hatred, jealousy, murder and cemeteries.
Still lives!
Be quiet, you idiot!
No, I'm the idiot.
Only an idiot can live this way with such anguish.
Don't you think so?
I think you're complicated.
But... Things will work out.
I've come full circle.
Are you still considering suicide?
Some people go fishing some go hunting, some go to war.
Others commit crimes of passion.
And some commit suicide. You have to kill someone.
That's life for you!
Take your drinking, for instance, you drink to kill the pain.
Me?
I drink to get drunk.
It amounts to the same thing.
As for you, I'm sure that if I did your portrait...
Leave me alone!
Your hands in your pockets, at night in the fog...
I've had enough of this!
You and your fancy talk!
It's getting on my nerves.
- Have you been drinking too?
- Shut up. What do you know?
I get upset and you insist that I've been drinking.
I haven't. I just haven't eaten for two days.
There's a sign on my belly that says "cold storage".
Didn't they feed you in the army?
What's it to you?
You should have said you were hungry. It's not hard.
I know. When you're hungry you ask for food.
Only I shut up out of pride.
I'm proud. Funny, that.
People say I'm headstrong. They're right. I am headstrong.
And you're hard-headed too!
You said you were hungry.
- I am. - Come on, then.
There's bread, sausage and some Chester cheese.
In Panama I always bought Chester.
If you haven't eaten for a while, you should eat slowly.
Aren't you going to tell me to enjoy my food?
Have you forgotten your manners?
You again!
Perhaps you're hungry too.
- Is he yours?
- Yes.
He's got a nice face.
So have you.
You're pretty and I like you.
I mean it.
You're skinny but I like you.
It's like in the movies, I see you and I like you.
It's love at first sight.
I'm love-struck.
You know that little chap with wings on his back and arrows?
Hearts on trees. Romance that ends in tears.
You're all the same. You play dirty tricks on us.
Do you really think that?
What?
What you say about love.
You girls are all the same.
You tout your wares, but really you're after romance.
What did you say?
We tout our wares?
Yes.
Have you never heard the expression before?
You tout your wares, you hustle.
Why do you talk to me like that?
Come off it!
Don't tell me you came here to bring your granny a cake, like Little Red Riding Hood.
Pity, because...
I'm the big bad wolf.
And the big bad wolf is not very clever.
Do you think khaki suits me?
Why do you keep laughing like that?
It's not a real laugh. It's sad.
Have you ever seen a woman fall in love with a soldier?
Women love a soldier when he's on parade.
But when a uniformed soldier shows up on his own, you should see the look on their faces then.
I don't even know why I'm telling you this.
Men and women can't get along.
They don't speak the same language.
They don't use the same vocabulary.
Maybe so, but they can still love one another.
Have you ever loved anyone?
- Not really. - Well, then?
What's that?
I don't know.
- What was that?
- Just some bad boys.
I picked a quiet spot to get away from them and they come here to kill one another.
Your lighting is like the catacombs.
- Well?
- Well! Most unfortunate.
How could you lose him?
He'll be hiding in that shack.
- What shack?
- The bar over there.
That dump?
Get in!
I'm sure he's here.
Then let's go and get him.
Open up. We're dying of thirst.
We're closed.
If you don't open up, we'll come in anyway.
- Shall we bash the door in? - First warning shot. Fired in the air, like in Panama.
The next one's for you. They're going to shoot.
Are you afraid of the gunfire?
- I wish that was all.
- What else is there?
I can't tell you.
Don't be afraid. I'm here. You're sweet.
What's your name?
Nelly.
I'm Jean.
The bastards!
A real naval battle! Wonderful!
The captain's all alone on board.
I think they got the message.
What a lovely night!
Indeed.
This looks like blood.
Blood?
What are you doing there?
Are you wounded?
I must have cut my hand when I fell.
May I come in?
Come in.
Life is a curious thing, at least what you see of it between midnight and 3am.
That man mustn't see me here.
I don't want too many people to see me either.
They were after me like a pack of wolves.
I got away but it was a close call.
- give me some rum, boss.
But you can wash your hands.
Ah, yes, my hands.
Blood stains clothes but it washes off hands easily.
Have you ever noticed how doctors, surgeons in particular, have white, well-kept hands?
Yet they paddle in blood all day long.
I'm not a doctor. I sell cut-price trinkets.
Nobody asked you what you did.
There's some rainwater outside in the bucket.
As you wish.
Are you an artist?
I wish I was. I love the arts.
Classical music, especially religious music.
It brings back memories.
I love sifting through my memories.
Family memories, childhood memories.
Where's your wound?
I can't see it.
I must have been mistaken.
And now I've lost my parcel.
My parcel. That is upsetting.
So that wasn't your blood?
I don't know who you are. It's none of my business.
It's dawn. You can go now.
You've got a face I don't like.
Some faces are likeable, some aren't.
It's unimportant. A face doesn't amount to much.
It carries so little weight.
Mine pleases nobody, but believe it or not, when I look in a mirror, I like it.
Better to have this face than none at all, right?
Each time the sun rises, we think something new will happen, something fresh.
Then the sun goes to bed and so do we.
It's sad.
Did you mean what you said earlier?
What?
About love.
I wouldn't have said it otherwise.
You might have said it to soften up a customer.
A customer?
Sorry to disturb you.
Nothing like a cold shower to perk a fellow up.
Now I'm fresh as a daisy and ready for work.
You work?
Yes, down at the docks.
This holds two litres.
Each morning I swipe two litres to sell at night.
It's illegal, of course, but I'm the only one who recorks the barrel.
It's a simple question of professional honesty.
Bye, then.
Excuse me, lovely lady, but work is work.
Staying here?
Where are you going?
- I don't know.
- We're going the same way, then.
Do you like life?
- What? - You like life, don't you?
Yes, on certain days.
Does life like you?
So far it's been pretty mean, but... that may change since I like it.
Thanks for your hospitality. You've been great.
Thank you for keeping me company.
If I can help in any way...
Help me?
Perhaps you could find me some civvies.
I see. So you're on permanent leave?
- I thought you didn't ask questions.
- Don't you trust me? - Yes, but...
- This is my only suit and I like it.
Come back tonight and I might have something.
Thanks.
What's your shoe size?
- Seven and a half. Why?
- No reason.
Coming?
Sometimes luck strikes.
He's a seven and a half, like me.
He needs clothes, I have some.
He wants a new life, but... he needs a pass.
Yes, he needs a new identity. That's obvious.
He's in luck. I have one going spare.
- My own. If he can use it...
I'm going swimming.
The sea's rough and it's foggy.
What?
I'm just stating the facts. The sea is rough and it's foggy.
And that's fine by me.
I swim pretty badly.
Even so, I'm going to swim out as far as possible.
What do you want me to say?
- Nothing.
Michel!
Don't do anything stupid. What good will it do?
What a fog!
What awful weather!
Shoes.
Bottle tops, an old comb.
The seabed's vast.
That's not the seabed. The seabed's further out and deeper.
You talk like a deep-sea diver.
- How old are you?
Me too...
I was 17 once.
- That's funny.
- What? - Look at Nelly.
- Where? There, with a soldier.
- I thought we were going for coffee?
I'm going to Panama's tonight.
Come along.
I will if I can.
Got any money?
- Why?
Do you want some?
- You don't have any. Yesterday you were hungry.
Why do you ask, then?
Hi.
What do you want?
Nothing.
We were just passing. I came over to say hello.
And to ask for news of Maurice.
- You must know something. - I know nothing.
I see you've already forgotten Maurice and found a replacement?
Great. You'll go out with anybody but you turn me down.
Why?
I think you're pretty.
You've got a pretty mouth.
- I like it. - Don't touch me!
You don't want to be touched? Did Maurice never touch you?
What about the others?
What about him? Everybody except me!
Leave me alone.
Instead of hanging out at the Petit Tabarin, you should stay in the shop with your guardian.
By the way, when you see Zabel, tell him from me that last night's fun was just a warning.
That business disgusts me.
Do I disgust you too?
You too.
You especially.
- Me especially, eh?
Leave her alone like she asked you to.
Take my advice, go and toss some stones in the water.
You soldiers are easily pleased.
You spit in the water and you're happy as Larry.
You can still leave her alone.
He's the calm type.
A master of self-control. There are three of us and you're on your own.
Three?
Can't you count?
You must be counting on the big man because you two don't amount to much.
- Whatever. Come with me.
- Leave her alone!
A simple soldier dishing out orders?
Get lost, will you?
Sorry, I'm a bit rough. It was just a joke.
Leaving, are you?
In a hurry now? Stay away from me.
Don't hit me.
Don't hit me. I'm warning you...
Watch it!
Watch what?
Lost your nerve all of a sudden, have you?
You've turned pale.
You don't look too good.
Next time you see me coming, I suggest you cross the street.
Otherwise you'll have this coming to you.
Come on!
Are you getting in or not?
Lucien looks like he's going to cry. So much for having fun!
Why did you do that?
You don't know if I'm worth it.
I thought you were in a hurry.
I don't know. I ran away.
If I go back, it will be awful.
I should go back too.
But if I did, like you say, it would be awful.
Goodbye, Jean.
I'll come to Panama's tonight if I can.
Goodbye.
It's me.
Listen. It's beautiful.
Shut up!
You make fun of all that is fine and beautiful.
You've laughed at us enough.
It's over.
Are you drunk or on drugs?
I'm sick of being humiliated.
I'm a man.
Do you hear me?
I'm a man and I'll prove it.
Right now! Put that away.
Reckless youth!
Give me the papers, all of them.
Tell us where Maurice is.
I bet you've bumped him off.
What a thing to say.
What were you doing down by the water with those parcels?
- Answer me, or else...
I'll show you who I am. I'll prove to you that I'm somebody.
I know who you are.
You're Lucien Lagardier, from a fine family but ill-bred.
Too much pocket money and yet never enough.
You struck some deals and got into trouble so you came to old Zabel to ask him to bail you out.
You're an ungrateful boy. I've helped you out before.
Last night you tried to run me over and shoot me.
I don't know where Maurice is.
But the papers concerning you are in safe keeping.
Were it god's will for me to die a violent death, you would all be in big trouble.
You came here to scare me and you haven't succeeded.
It's true. They came here to scare me.
To scare me!
You little worms!
Don't you realise I can't even scare myself?
Shut him up!
Shut him up or I'll kill him.
I'll shoot you, I swear it.
What good would that do?
- Let me go.
- Come on. Go out the back way.
- One day I'll prove I'm somebody.
- What's got into him?
A soldier taught him a lesson earlier.
It was about Nelly.
- Lucien tried to talk to her.
The soldier punched Babe and slapped Lucien.
What did Lucien do?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
These soldiers are admirable.
Why are you telling me this?
Lucien is your friend.
Friends come and go.
- Expecting someone for lunch?
- Yes, my goddaughter.
Think she'll come back?
She always comes back.
Here she is now. go.
Goodbye.
You fly off like a swallow.
You desert your old guardian.
You leave him all alone, worried sick.
Why did you run off the other night?
I was scared.
You're such a baby.
Why come back, then?
The others scare me too. Where else can I go?
Don't you like it here?
Aren't I good to you?
You're still a little girl and yet you're a little lady too.
Don't look at me like that!
Where were you last night?
Nowhere. I went for a walk.
And found a regiment. Soldiers are handsome, aren't they?
Is it sailing soon?
- Tomorrow.
- Where to?
Venezuela, I think.
Want something?
No, just looking.
Stay there. You must be tired.
Can I help you?
I'd like the little box in the window.
I'd like "Jean and Nelly" engraved on it. And today's date.
It's good to be sentimental. People are so hard-hearted these days.
This man has a gift for you.
I'll make you a gift of your gift to Nelly.
Any friend of my goddaughter's is a friend of mine.
Do you like animals?
They don't like me much.
- May I help you?
- We'd like some postcards.
Did you follow me here?
No. I looked in the window and came in.
Why did you want to buy me a souvenir?
To get rid of some spare cash. I don't accept money from women.
Men, women, what difference does it make?
Sorry. Business is business.
I hope you'll have coffee with us.
- No, thanks. I have to...
- Please. Such politeness in a soldier is unheard of.
Come along.
I suppose you're on leave.
You're not from round here.
I bet you're from Paris.
- Yes. - That's obvious.
- Sit down. - Thanks.
Everyone's welcome here.
Are you here to see family?
Nelly, fetch a bottle of cognac from the cellar.
She's a nice girl, isn't she?
She runs away from time to time, but it's nothing serious.
Her mother was like that too.
Short escapades but nothing serious.
Then one day she left and never came back.
The girl stayed with her father.
He was a fine man but he died.
More coffee?
It's better than your average cup.
Do you like the army?
I get to travel.
- Have you been in Le Havre long?
- Since yesterday.
Pretty town, isn't it?
Nelly, what is it?
Nelly!
Don't touch me. Leave me alone!
I need to talk to you.
What do you want from him?
You have a fever. Come and lie down.
I'll take you to your room.
She's so sensitive. The slightest thing upsets her.
You were at Panama's last night.
What of it?
I didn't see you but I saw your dog. He growled at me.
Nelly was there too, wasn't she?
I don't answer questions I don't like.
No one who spends the night there has a clear conscience.
Really?
That goes for me as well as you.
Do you have a good memory for numbers?
I do.
Take this number, for example.
36-14.
I only saw it once but I remember it. What?
It's your army serial number. I saw it on your shirt earlier.
So?
So this.
I'm very discreet about people who do me a favour.
And people who don't?
That depends.
You did me a favour without knowing it.
By slapping Lucien Lagardier.
- Who?
- This morning down by the docks.
I'm well informed.
What I don't see, I guess.
You didn't come to Le Havre by chance.
That's none of your business.
Perhaps, but I'm interested.
You came here because of the ships.
You're in trouble and you want to leave in search of a new life.
I can help you leave. I don't want anything.
I have money if you want.
I can get you ID, a passport.
Lucien Lagardier is an immoral good-for-nothing.
He's threatening me and he'll stop at nothing.
So?
I do you a favour, you do me one.
Everyone's happy.
At night Lucien goes down by the water.
You're there.
You push him. He falls in. Child's play!
Whenever a rogue disappears, society breathes a little easier.
Think it over.
Is that right?
I've thought it over.
Listen... In Tonkin I once saw a limp, gooey bug.
Just seeing it wiggle made me want to puke.
It was a scolopendra.
You remind me of it, with your slimy voice. You sound as if you're wading through slime.
My voice is odd but so are you.
I am the way I am.
I've only ever stepped out of line when I've been angry.
Whenever anything good happens, scum like you come and mess it up.
You disgust me but I don't like squashing bugs.
Come on.
I was watching.
Jean, be careful.
- Of your guardian?
- Yes. I can see why you want to get out of that place.
Can I see you tonight?
- Where?
- Anywhere.
The fair on the dock.
- Fairs are big places. - This is a small one.
I'll meet you at the carousel with the white rabbits.
- What time?
This is some pair of shoes!
So that's why he asked my size.
And I yelled at the poor man.
It's a shame he left before I could thank him.
Do you know where he went?
People come and go.
We're all just passing through.
All the same, I feel lucky.
I'm not normally so lucky but today...
I'm a lucky devil.
Funny how light a hat can feel when you're not used to it.
It's so light.
The trousers are a bit tight but...
They have side tabs. I can adjust them.
Nice cloth.
He must be rich to give these away.
No doubt. He left this for you too.
Money?
850 francs.
- 850?
- And that's not all.
A passport.
- What for?
- He thought you might need it.
He thought...
I didn't ask for anything.
How did he guess?
Guess what?
That I wanted to leave. What about him?
He won't be needing it.
- Really?
- He's not bothered. So if it will help you...
Michel Kraus.
Height: 5'8.
Medium-sized nose, brown hair.
Funny how all men look alike on paper.
- You'll have to change the picture. - That's easily done.
And fix the stamp and the signature.
That's easy too. Here...
If no one has come for this in a year and a day, it's yours.
Thanks. I'm no good with words, so...
Come on.
Don't forget your paint box.
Your name's Michel Kraus and you're an artist.
That's right.
- goodbye. - goodbye.
- When do you sail?
- Tomorrow at five.
- For Venezuela?
Pretty, isn't it?
The ships, the sea, the sailors...
Everything's pretty to an artist.
I've been watching you. It's easy to spot a painter's eye.
I was almost a painter myself.
I had paint in my blood.
Then I did a medical degree. Utter madness.
You're looking at the doctor in spite of himself!
Dr. Mollet, doctor on board the Louisiana.
Michel Kraus. - Will you have a drink with me?
- I'm in a hurry. I have a lot to do too.
I sail tomorrow but I still have time for a drink.
- You sail tomorrow?
- For Venezuela.
Come along if you like. She's a good ship. You'd be comfortable.
For a painter travel is a source of renewal.
- Do you take passengers?
- Seriously? You'd really like to come?
Why not?
There's nothing keeping me here.
As long as it's not too expensive.
I know you artists aren't wealthy.
Come on. Big decisions are best made over a glass of something.
Hi!
You look happy. good day?
You bet! Two litres of the best.
- Where are you off to?
- Hello.
- What's it to be?
- A room. - A room?
Right away.
- What about my rum?
- Coming right up.
- Want something?
Yes, give me a shot.
- Of what?
- A small shot of rum.
In a big glass!
It's just a formality. You artists are all bohemians.
My papers are in order. My passport...
Perfect. I'll arrange everything with the captain.
You can tell me if you like my watercolours.
Watercolours?
Are you a landscape painter?
I don't go in for theories.
You're not a cubist?
A cubist?
No. Just as well, because I find cubism...
What do you paint?
In general... I paint things that are hidden behind things.
Very interesting.
For example, if I see a swimmer,
I think he's going to drown. So I paint a drowning man.
Your painting doesn't sound very cheerful.
As long as it's well painted. Never mind the subject matter.
Good health!
Boss, another shot to keep these company.
Are you going to take that room or not?
Ah, yes, the room.
- How much is it?
- 18 francs.
And what do I owe you?
18 francs.
I'll pay up, then.
- What about the room?
Too late. good night.
And be on time. Ships don't wait for you.
Do you have much luggage?
Very little, just one suitcase.
- One suitcase?
You're leaving for Venezuela with one suitcase?
How wonderful!
Just as I imagine an artist to be.
No baggage, independence, freedom.
It's good to be free.
Yes, it is.
I'm sure you plan to return. I mean...
Aren't you involved with anyone?
No one.
Don't move.
One... two... three.
Thank you.
The journey's over so soon.
It would be wonderful if we could sail away, the two of us.
The two of us...
That reminds me. Wait here.
I need another picture.
- Another one?
- Yes, I need another one.
To send to a girl?
- No.
- Really?
I said no, didn't I?
Do you take passport pictures?
Isn't that pretty? Maybe, but he looks unhappy.
It would be sad to lose him. I'm used to him now, and to you.
You're a funny girl.
Looking at you or listening to you... makes me want to cry.
That shooting is getting on my nerves.
- Hungry?
- I don't want a thing. I feel good.
Really?
You feel good with me?
You have no idea how good I feel with you.
I can breathe.
This must be what happiness feels like.
If I heard you say that to anyone else, I'd say it was silly.
But when you say it to me, it's strange but I like it.
You've got pretty eyes.
Kiss me.
Kiss me again.
- I'll get the tickets. - There's a queue.
A queue?
What do you take me for?
Excuse me. We're with some ladies.
- Six. - You've got a nerve!
Hands off! We rule the roost here.
Don't make me laugh or my eye-liner will run.
- I hate people like that.
- People like what? Shut up!
Find yourself another one.
Watch out for draughts. My hat!
What's wrong, Lucien?
Are you sick?
Watch the dog.
I warned you.
Come on, Nelly.
I'll kill him!
Zabel too. I'll shoot them both.
You do understand?
Of course I understand.
Life can be such a bitch.
It was deadly at Zabel's, stifling.
I'd have gone anywhere.
At the Petit Tabarin everyone danced and laughed.
Maurice was gentle with me and he said that he loved me.
I said I loved him too.
But it wasn't true.
No one really danced or laughed.
No one was in love. It was all make-believe.
Don't cry.
When you call me Nelly like that, it's as if I were still a little girl.
You haven't grown up all that much.
I have. I've grown up too fast and seen too much.
I'm damaged.
Damaged?
Don't be silly.
You're the sweetest girl I've ever met.
A pretty young girl who loves life is like a man making a bid for freedom.
The world is against them.
They get hunted down.
Living is hard.
Yes. We're all alone.
At times we meet people we barely know and may never see again.
And they help us.
We don't know why. It's strange.
People love one another.
No, they don't. They don't have time for that.
I love you, Jean.
You talk like a child.
I really do love you.
Don't leave me. What will I do without you?
I'm not going back to Zabel's.
I can't live in constant fear.
Will you stay a few more days?
Who said I was leaving?
Seeing you in civvies, I suddenly thought...
What difference does it make?
Maybe you'll take me with you?
Take you with me?
Don't you like me?
Keep me with you.
You're beautiful.
- Remember?
Last night you woke me and spoke very softly.
You said you loved me.
I said that?
- You must have been dreaming.
- Or you were. - Me?
- Dreaming out loud.
I don't dream.
Everyone dreams.
- What time is it?
- I don't know.
The sunlight is lovely.
Why are you smiling?
I don't know.
I thought life was so sad and now...
I see that maybe I was wrong so I'm happy.
I have to tell you something.
It's not very nice.
- What is it?
- Breakfast.
I brought the newspaper.
There's an amazing crime story.
The victim wasn't just anybody.
He's not very cheery.
How many sugars?
GRUESOME DISCOVERY
The mutilated body of a local man washed up on the quay
- How dreadful!
- What's wrong?
I was right to be afraid.
I knew it.
I sensed something was going to happen.
How dreadful! Well, well.
Don't cry.
I'm sure the scream I heard that night...
It was him. I knew I wasn't dreaming.
Don't cry, Nelly.
I didn't love him and he hurt me, but that's not a reason to kill him.
Do you know who did this?
I'm pretty sure I do.
Sorry. I need the tray.
The hotel only has two.
We've got twelve rooms so it's not easy.
You weren't very hungry.
Can I take it? Yes, and make it quick.
There's quite a crowd on the quay where they found him.
And there's more.
Apparently, they found a parcel of clothes belonging to a soldier.
They say he did it. Maybe he did.
No, it's not possible. You can't get dragged into this.
This or something else.
I was about to say something when that idiot came in with the paper, but...
It's quite simple.
A ship is sailing for Venezuela at four and I plan to be on it.
You're leaving me.
You must think I'm a bastard.
Because I should have told you last night.
I saw how happy you were.
I wanted you so badly so I said nothing.
You were right not to.
But it wouldn't have changed anything.
Kiss me.
I can explain.
It's not complicated. - I'm a wanted man. - I don't need to know.
You can trust me. I'm not a bad man.
Of course you're not because I love you.
Anyway, what of it? If you were bad, perhaps I'd love you just the same.
Were you sure you'd get away?
Everything was set. I thought my luck had changed.
They won't find me on the Louisiana.
My papers are in order.
- Unless...
- Unless what? Unless your guardian Zabel...
He threatened me.
He guessed everything. If he talks, I'm done for.
- He won't say anything. - Why?
I know what to say to shut him up.
Do you think I'm going to let you go back there?
I've got nothing to fear. Anyway, what can you do?
You must go.
I've been happy with you.
If you're free, I'll still be happy, even if you are far away.
- I'll never forget you, Nelly.
- Really? Really.
If I manage to get away, I'll send for you.
I'll come.
You're going, I'm going.
It's crazy.
We were so happy together.
You have no idea how much I like you... how much I wanted you last night.
And now?
I want you like I did last night.
Morning, all.
Apparently, it was a soldier who did it.
- How do you know?
- That's what they're saying.
They!
- Boss, I want a room.
- At this time of day? Now is as good a time as any.
Besides, I'm sleepy.
It's too early.
The rooms are all occupied.
I'll wait.
Want something? I'm not thirsty, I'm sleepy.
Nelly, is that you?
Yes, it's me. I'm glad you're back.
I've been so worried. Have you seen the paper?
Let that be a lesson to you.
No more running away. Don't worry.
They don't know who killed poor Maurice.
Some say it was Lucien Lagardier.
Others say it was a soldier. Maybe yours.
I don't want anyone bothering him.
We both know who did it.
And I can prove it.
You have too much imagination.
You heard a scream and found a cufflink behind a crate and now you're imagining terrible things.
I'm telling you, I know. I bet the police came here today.
Did you mention Jean? The police did come here today.
They were very polite.
But I did not mention Jean.
If they had searched for him, they would have found him with you.
I'm sure you spent the night with him.
In a hotel.
In a bed!
You can't scare me now, whatever happens.
I'll never be scared again!
I want you to let him leave.
How you've changed, Nelly!
Your eyes have never shone so brightly.
You've lost your baby face.
So that's it.
Why do you all have to be in love?
Does anyone love me?
This is my home.
- And my home is your home.
Looking at my watercolours?
The follies of my youth.
Don't judge them too harshly. Give me your passport and I'll take care of everything.
- Here. - Thanks.
You don't scare me any longer.
You horrify me!
Let me go.
You disgust me! Don't yell.
No one can hear you.
I want you to listen.
I'll stay here.
I want you to know why I killed him. I thought you liked his looks.
That's enough!
Maurice was a good-for-nothing.
I couldn't bear the idea of you and him...
That's enough!
I did it because I was jealous. You've never experienced jealousy, you stupid child.
It's terrible to be in love, to love like Romeo when you resemble Bluebeard.
Be quiet!
I horrify you, do I?
At times I horrify myself.
But it doesn't stop me from living. At times I'm even happy, when you're near me.
Leave me alone!
I like you even when you scream. You're the only thing I love.
Jean!
Let go of her.
- Let go of her, you bastard!
- Come on.
- Watch out!
Do you think you can leave, just like that?
You must believe in miracles.
Or Santa Claus.
You're the worst scum I've ever met!
I'll say she helped kill him. You're disgusting!
You don't deserve to live.
What a mess!
Why did you come back?
I was on board the ship and then I got off because...
I wanted to see you. I wanted to tell you I'd been happy in my life for once, thanks to you.
Oh, Jean! The ship hasn't sailed yet.
You could still make it.
The ship? Please, Jean, you must go.
Kiss me.
Quickly.
There is no time to lose.
It's not possible.
You can't leave me alone.
You can't die.
It's Jan Duchesi, he is the star of the show.
- Nice fellow. Nice fellow.
- Did you get it? - No!
Want to take an autograph?
I got one for 2 shillings. You have mine. It is only 1.9.
I'll have both. It's unfair.
"The Green Eye of the Little Yellow God"...
By Milton Haynes. "There's a one-eyed yellow idol to the north of Khatmandu...
"There's a little marble cross below the town...
"There's a broken-hearted woman tends the grave of Mad Carew...
And the Yellow God forever gazes down."
He is always muscling in.
What can you do, he has a sympathy on the subject.
"He was known as "Mad Carew" by the subs at Khatmandu...
"He was hotter than they felt inclined to tell...
But for all his foolish pranks, he was worshipped in the ranks...
"And the Colonel's daughter smiled on him as well.
"He had loved her all along, with a passion of the strong...
"And that she returned his love was plain to all...
"She was nearly twenty-one and arrangements were begun...
"To celebrate her birthday with... a ball...
"On the night before the dance... "Mad Carew seemed in a trance...
"And they chaffed him as they puffed at their cigars...
"But for once he failed to smile, and he sat alone awhile...
"Then went out into the night beneath the stars.
- He returned before the dawn..." - Where's Biddy? - "with his shirt and tunic torn...
Twenty... "He bade her search the pocket, saying...
"That's from Mad Carew...
"And she found... the little green eye of the god."
It should be in that queue.
"She thought of him and hastened to his room... You keep out of that bar!
- "As she crossed the barrack square - Go to your business. We're following that!
"the dreamy air of a waltz tune... "softly stealing thro' the gloom.
Thank you, sir. "His door was open wide...
"with silver moonlight shining through... "The place was wet and slipp'ry where she trod...
- Hey! Let me go! - Hand me that!
- Let me go! - Make me! "An ugly knife lay buried in the heart of Mad Carew!
'Twas the "Vengeance of the Little Yellow God."
I must ask you to excuse this slight fracas.
I do not stand here for my own enjoyment.
So, I will ask my friend Gentry here... to collect any small tribute you might feeling kind to dispose.
A golden sovereign's been out of the question these cruel hard times.
Two pennies will be always acceptable.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Ladies and gentlemen... With your kind permission and attention... a new conception of London's latest song success.
- Hello Charlie, how goes it? - It's gone!
- May I have a coffee, please, Doggie? - What with? I got a sixpence, I got a sixpence!
It's a change!
- Two big slabs of bread and butter. Here! Who are they?
That one with the funny hat... he is an American newspaperman.
He's showing the Englishman a bit of London.
Oh, he got a smile, hasn't he?
What's his wonderful name? The name is Prentiss.
I think it's Harley Prentiss, the song-writer!
Here, you're song-writer?
Yes.
Ever sold anything? Yes. Who are you?
Libby. From Liberty.
From the Statue of Liberty in New York harbour.
What do you do?
Oh, I am a dancer, I am.
And I recite.
Like to hear me?
"There is a one-eyed yellow monster to the north of Kathmandu.
"There's a little standing cross below the town...
"There's a broken-hearted woman tends the grave of Mad Carew...
"And a little god forever gazing down...
"He returned before the dawn, with his shirt and trousers torn...
"And a gash across his temple...
"dripping of red...
"He was patched up right away...
"and he slept all through the day...
"While the Colonel's daughter watched beside his bed...
"As she crossed the village's square... "She did have a dreamy air... - "Of a wo...
- Wait! You and me's got have a talk. Here!
What she done or what she not done is my affair, see?
- Now you look here... - Look here... - Now look here...
Now you look here... What's the problem here? - Just a squabble.
- So keep it quite, please. - Sorry, sir. - And don't call me sir.
Sorry, mate.
- Doggie, serve off your customers.
- Right, sir.
Now, look here, young woman...
We have all looked everywhere.
Let's just relax and have a cigarette.
Do you smoke?
Very kind of you, sir.
A cup of coffee, please Doggie.
- Have it on me. - Thank you, sir. Thank you, thank you.
- Don't mind if I do. - Give us a light? - Yes, rather.
Come on, Harley, let's go on.
No Patsy, so eat and wait till I pay the bill.
- Take it all on me, will you? - Yes! Include the doorsteps and coffee.
Thank you very much. Oh, thank you, sir.
So, where are you going to take me now?
I suggest a stroll up Bond Street.
I suggest a taxi.
Well, I... I got to go now.
- Good night, all! - Wait.
Allow me to take the...
The liberty. Oh... tha-tha-thank you, sir.
Good night to all!
Did anyone happen to see what I saw?
See what?
Good night all!
But I'll have the cigarette case, please! I'd be obliged if you'd explain, what you are talking about?
It's a good pose, see you got the right idea but you keep that for an audience, see... come on, hand it over. Oh, go to...
Look out, you hurt me!
You don't say. Thank God he's got his name in it.
On to the reward, I see.
You have a nasty, cheap little mind, haven't you? Well, so long!
And when the cops get on to all of this don't call on me... as a witness to character.
Just a minute!
Look here, mister, who does this lovely world belong to, hey?
To the people who live on it you say?
Well, I am one of them. And I've got just the same taste as all the rest. You'd be surprised!
I get hungry, I get thirsty, I get cold.
I enjoy a smoke and a permanent wave and... and whatever I can get in the way of extras.
And why shouldn't I have them? Because you haven't earned them.
Anyone ever give me the chance?
An orpheline's brought me up and got me dog-washing dishes.
But I quit that of readily double time, and why?
Because it ruins the hands, see?
And I've my right to a manicure as the next.
- Don't talk foolish.
- Why not?
Why not?
Oh gosh, why not?
Can you answer? There is no answer.
You're after justice and logic.
There ain't no justice and there ain't no logic. The world ain't made that way.
Everything's luck, see?
And good temper.
And if you can take a joke.
The whole of life's a joke.
A joke?
So it is a joke I can't face, see?
I can't face it! I can't face it! I can't face it!
Now, now, now... Hysterics don't help.
Don't you touch me! That's the second time you've leant into me!
And I don't like it, see!
So stop it, do you hear me? Stop it!
I'll set you in jail, you rotter!
I'll say about you that... - Just let me go!
- Hey! - Let me go!
- Hey! - Let me go!
- Listen to me!
Stop it! Cops!
Come on!
Oh, me beret!
- This door.
- It's stuck.
- Break it!
- Hear that, Maud? - Hear what?
A heavy tread and a female voice. You and your voices.
Through places and palaces...
Where true hell arrives...
Careful! Alright.
There's no place like it, is there?
I'm slug in here. Like it? Maybe you can tell me what I do now.
I asked you what I was to do. And I answered.
Sleep on it.
And turn off the gas when you're done.
If not before.
I'll consider your problems in the morning.
Poor pussy! Hello!
Good Morning! Do you want to come in?
Ah, you're always lost. Now pussy, come on in.
Don't make a noise. Whoa!
Look at that!
Ahw, come knows it better, young rascal and go sit down now...
And don't forget to stop Julian from fiddling into my wireless.
Julian leave that wireless alone and sit down there to have breakfast.
Can we begin?
To be sure you can.
Manners! You wait, mylord, till your father's finished shaving.
Ah, let the children have their breakfast. So they are starving.
Puss! Hello, puss.
Pussy!
Morning!
Sleep alright?
- Don't know yet.
- Well, find out will you. Don't you wanto to wash and brush up?
We'd better and leave, pussy.
Come on downstairs.
Go and get the morning milk.
Get up!
Daddy, can I get down?
You sit quite till your brother is done. I am done.
You be quiet and wipe your nose. - Come here you...
- The kettle is boiling over!
- Oh, turn it out. - Turn it out yourself, lazybones.
Hey, I haven't finished.
Hiccups?
I've never seen a man do sewing before.
There's a lot of things in this life you haven't seen before.
- Where's the cat? - Asleep.
What we need now is that I go first.
Hello, Julian.
What do you want Julian?
Mom asks have you turned the skirt up yet?
Come back in half an hour and then shall we see.
Can I see your little boy?
Oh no, he's sleeping. Hey, what's up?
- What have you done?
- My finger!
Come on. Come here!
Hold it up. I'll tie it up with a piece of cloth.
I want to see the little boy. Off you chummy!
What did he mean, the little "boy"? Ah, he means Robert.
Lives over there.
I used to be a ventriloquist... before I took up the classics.
- Good morning, grandfather! - I am not your grandfather.
Liar!
Charlie's young lady has cut her hand.
What young lady? The young lady who was having breakfast with him.
Oh, so he's got a woman in his room, has he?
Pray say you ever managed to pull an audience... with ventriloquism?
They are not as smart as you. You're right!
Never anyone's fooled me yet.
Never mind those things.
Come on!
I'll leave the skirt with Maud on our way.
On our way where?
To the station.
What's that?
Oh, you couldn't do such a rotten thing.
Not after letting me sleep here and... and give me breakfast and... and me believing in you.
You couldn't!
What did I do?
Now, what's all the excitement?
What?
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?
Aren't you...
Aren't you going to turn me in?
Can't fool you, can I now... You silly little thing.
Only going to hand it to the station just as if we had found it.
Took you in proper, right?
Why did you do it for?
No offense, mind you.
But I thought you needed a lesson.
Can't have you constantly pinching cigarette cases, you know?
Come on!
How long has this woman been here, may I ask?
Se here! Who are you calling "woman"?
I won't have it and my wife won't have it. And I'll thank you to hand over her skirt.
He'll hand it over only when payed for his work, see?
Now Libby, this has nothing to do with you.
Nothing to do with me?
Sticking his nose in our affairs?
- Look here, young woman! - Look here, old man!
You can't have a brawl in front of a lady.
- A lady?
- That's what he said, lady.
Well, I'll boot you out.
- Oh, you will, will you?
- Yes! How dare you put a finger on me!
Sorry!
Let me out!
Maud! Let me out of here! Let me out!
Maud! Let me out! Let me out!
Maud! Maud! - What is it now?
- He had a woman in his room! Oh yes, I have and I shall have!
Look here Maud... have you ever known me too to dump you... when I know well that what I got in there... is my new leading lady.
You can draw a double take of blow in the face.
She sings like a robin and dances as a fay.
Not while I'm here, she won't.
Maud...
Dear Maud!
Well, maybe... maybe I could wait a while till then... until I have a room, please.
You do that for me Maud, and I'll give Julian elocution lessons.
Other people teach... people lessons... to... think.
Oh, well...
The trouble about education is... it comes expensive.
Here...
What's up?
- Where's my beret?
- Now, look here...
I'm trying to get my beret.
- You don't want your beret. - Go away!
Silly little kilt, aren't you?
I never did!
Come on now, stop it.
You're grown up, you have got to behave you know?
Stop hugging me.
What's the matter now?
I'm sorry I broke your things.
I'm sorry I stole your sixpence.
I'm sorry I made a mock of you.
I'm sorry, you silly fool.
I'm sorry!
Alright, then you're forgiven.
Now, now stop it, see?
Now, you'll cry yourself all puffy.
Got a mirror?
Got a frying pan. Come here.
I don't use that one. I keep it for shaving purposes.
Do you see yourself?
That's more like it!
Like what?
More like my leading lady.
Leading lady?
What do you mean?
What I say...
I've seen you dance.
And how you gave an imitation of me.
I don't mind saying, I consider you promising. We have the experience...
You have the temperament. All we want now... a new turn.
C-H-A-R-L-E-S.
- There!
- I wonder if I did that right? How many "p"s in happy?
Ah, who cares!
Many Happy Returns to Charles.
And many of them. No room.
Got it for his age.
Baddie young geezer, come out of there!
What are you doing in there?
Take that cake and be off with you!
What a nice clutch of children I have got!
Holy Saints, look at the state you're in!
Come out, Tess dear, come out.
Hello! What've you got in there, ye young... geezer, do you hear?
And look at the mess... throughout the dress I had made so clean and all.
Hey! I don't hold with clean pinafores!
He'll be in before the cake!
Hey!
Hey, take it easy, Charles!
Hey, hey, here I say!
What are you up to?
Don't come until I call you, see?
What are you up to, in there?
Oy, when can I come in?
Oy! I'm getting cold out here.
Open the door!
You can come in now.
What's it about, so...
Many Happy Returns! Oh no...
I'm not 40, I'm 39.
How did you know it's my birthday?
I was looking through your papers, found your birth certificate.
Much obliged, I'm sure!
Very nice!
Thank you.
Put it on!
Here, give it to me!
Hold still!
Makes me look a bit yellow.
You've been looking yellow lately.
You haven't had a Saturday off since I've been working with you.
It's time you had a holiday.
So long as you come.
I hate and detest the country. I could make you like it.
Ever heard the nightingale?
Pretty! We must take a Sunday off soon.
I wish I could see your face first time you hear one.
Can you admit us?
- Hello!
- It's my birthday!
- Many returns, Charlie!
- Thank you very much! I never knew!
Anyone else would've given anyone else the hint. If you'd only let Charles get to his own cake.
- Come on everybody, sit down!
- Here, Charles! What a cake hey, what a cake! What a cake, what a cake!
Would you believe it?
- Lovely!
- I must say. Forty? You?
Oh you're getting little aged, really eh? I ain't 40... I'm 39!
Farewell, you slimmer!
One, two, three!
Cut it careful! You can also say I'm looking at stuff as you like... but it'll be a sensation.
I feel it in me bones.
Right old boy, but my individuality may be swamped in an ensamble.
Nowadays the individual is washed up.
Cooperation that's the stuff, so I says to myself... the young Gentry on his own, and poor old Arthur on his own...
- I've got Biddy.
- Maybe you have got Biddy... But you and Biddy, you're a duet, you ain't a troupe.
Boys!
What I'm feeling after's a troupe. - Tell them my idea!
- You tell them! Well, we form a quartet... and we do a big production number.
We thought we call ourselves "The Cooperators".
Julian.
- What about the music? - Dinah?
Bicycle Made for Two? - Tipperary? - No, no, those are classics.
Can't we have something modern, something with a... with a swing to it?
Tell them your idea. Well...
I had thought of a little composition of my own. Ah, you want...
Hey! I think we got something there!
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three, four...
I love you!
One, two, three, and...
And one right, one left... one right, one left, one right... One could go with this stuff at least for one "giro" more...
Hey, what's all this?
Is this a respectable private residence or is it the BBC?
They are making a new turn.
Oh, I won't have it!
Dear! Pass along people, pass along! Does a Mr. Staggers live here, Mr. Charles Staggers?
Who's asking this? Not long he won't if he don't shut his windows.
One, two, three, four... da-da! Charles!
You ought to be on this side now! Arthur, give me the guitar and teach Charles to keep his step.
Gentry, come on! Awh, come on Charlie, don't loose up, look to me it is only a knack.
Ready? One, two, three, four.
Charlie, you're not doing it right!
I know I'm not... but I can't do that ta-ta game, that's why!
Charlie, come here.
They want you. There's a gentleman to see you.
Carry on!
Oh... why... - Mr. Prentiss, ain't it?
Who... uh... lost a cigarette case.
Well, I'll be bidding you good-day.
Thank you so much.
I'm awfully sorry to break in like this, but...
I only got back yesterday and I... found you returned my cigarette case.
I just wanted to thank you. Did you wonder not hearing from me before?
Oh no no, lots of people don't trouble, gloves and such.
I had to leave this address for my "bona fide".
Oh, yes. Well now...
I'd rather not, sir...
I mean... the circumstances...
The girl? The girl, sir?
Don't quite take your meaning. Your cigarette case was found under the counter, sir... after you left.
No reason to refuse the reward, is there?
Very good of you, sir, I'd rather not, sir.
Sorry. I'm sorry too, sir.
In fact...
I'm only sorry the whole thing happened.
Come on, Charles, I got a new step.
Oh, did you wait in... It's alright Miss. Liberty.
Oh, pleased to meet you again!
I came to thank Mr. Staggers for returning my cigarette case.
Oh... had you dropped it?
Won't you come in? We are rehearsing. Mustn't waste Mr. Prentiss' time, Libby.
It's a pity you didn't bring your journalist friend along.
No, no, Libby, Libby!
Well, he might've given us a rouser. So might I.
What?
You don't mean to say you could do us an interview?
Charlie wanted interviewed, how if he interviewed you?
Come on in! Ever since my early childhood...
I had an intense desire to express myself.
I have still hesitated in which direction to develop my career... but I had the good fortune to meet Mr. Charles Staggers... one of the leading street artists of the day.
We joined the forces with Mr. Arthur Smith...
Mr... what's your real name, Gentry?
I'd rather not say.
Well anyway, we never looked back.
We are hoping to put on a new show at the Holborn Empire next Monday.
Monday? I'll be there.
Libby... the gentleman... don't understand.
We're outside, not inside.
He knows but he didn't put that down. Libby, you didn't got to sit on the arm of that chair... you know it ain't safe.
Go on! Miss Liberty...
Liberty what? Just Liberty. Like Garbo, see?
Looks better on a billboard.
First I've heard of all this. Liberty, as she prefers to be called... will not always be content with the life of the streets.
Is that the line? That's the line.
My ambition is to dance in every capital in Europe. Starting with the Holborn Empire.
I'll bring them over when they're finished.
Very good, aren't they? Pathetically funny.
That girl can dance anyway.
- Here you go. - Thank you! Lady!
Hello, Mr. Staggers!
Oh hey, Prentiss, good night to you too. Libby, Libby, Mr. Prentiss is here!
- Would you excuse me, sir?
- Thank you. - Hello, Libby. - How do you do?
- Love your show. - Quite good isn't it it? You go on to meet with my friends.
Yes, of course!
They want to meet us. Come on!
There you are! Miss Liberty, Mr. Staggers, Lady Celina.
- How do you do? - How do you do?
- Miss Fordingbridge. - How do you do?
How do you do Miss, Madam, Mr... honoured also... would you excuse me...
I... thank you.
Thank you madam, thank you... - Thank you... - Pass along lad...
You've been here long enough. Ho no, it's just as it seems where you come from.
You want me to run you in?
Look here... That's all right, sir.
We know them. Now, off with you!
Now, it's entirely my fault, constable.
Oh, we can't allow obstruction, sir.
Do they always push them around like that? But that's altogether right!
That seems to me an excuse for begging.
Right kids, slippy. Go through it, boys, we truck out.
It's enough for ourselves for tonight.
We will take it, Charlie.
Run along!
I'm awfully sorry about that!
You got the money and you got the right. - Oh, Libby! - You heard him move us on.
Listen, I'm giving a party, but I don't want you to come dance for us.
What? Do you know what your fine friends say about us?
- Thank you for nothing! - Don't be so snob!
I'm asking you for your professional entertainement! Professional?
Oh!
- Come on now, Libby!
We'll be there! Goodbye!
All close on 12 pounds. Come on! We'll be alright.
But taking by and large...
I wouldn't ask for better support! From a better company.
As for Libby... we all know the new turn was her idea.
I remodelled it, of course... now, the last word has to lie with the producer, my girl.
Here's to busking... past, present and future, gentlemen!
Gentlemen, ladies, gentlemen... Shall I tell you something?
In ten years from today... there won't be a busker on the street.
What do you mean?
Just because you took 12 bobbies... and everything is lovely, well it's not, see?
What do you suppose it means when they're allowed to moving you on... and fire laws, and charged with obstruction if I just sneeze.
Yeah! I'd like to see 'em! You'll have your wish.
Nobody wants us, really.
They laugh at us.
You hold your noise! She's right!
What are you talking about?
My family sold flowers on the old streets of London... for the old Queen's coronation.
But the hansoms have gone... and the horses have gone.
And soon... now... we'll have to go.
Tonight cured me.
You heard old Maud and you heard that chatting lady.
An excuse for begging, she said, and she was right.
I'm off. Coming? I am the manager, you are a member of my troupe...
Sit down!
Good night, all.
I see! Yes, madam?
Mr. Prentiss asked me.
What name, madam?
Liberty.
Oh yes, he is expecting you.
Will you come in, please.
Take your time, please.
May I take your things?
Thank you. And your... hat?
Thank you. This way, please.
Here you are at last, I'm so glad.
Didn't you bring Mr. Staggers? No... no... he's...
Stopped to make a speech.
Oh, I'm so sorry! Well, come and meet everybody.
Wait until they're finished! Come here then, Libby.
Late, aren't you? How did the new turn go?
Didn't Libby tell you? No!
I'm going to bed!
Good night.
Row, of course.
It's early yet. She'll be in later.
You and Libby didn't have words with each other?
No, no, no, she told me she might not be in yet for a while.
She couldn't say.
It is good! What is it?
Don't tell us you've never tasted champagne before!
I do tell you I've never tasted champagne before. Try some of my cooking Miss Liberty?
Much obliged.
Sausages in pickle? I don't get her.
I don't get any of you!
You will.
Go to bed, Maud, dear. After all, it is my job to wait up for her.
And why is it your job, Charlie?
Why?
Well, I mean, she has to have some man to look after her, hasn't she?
Of course she has! Some young fellow of her own age... to take her to dances and parties and things.
Why shouldn't I speak up for her?
How do you know well enough... a man's hair wrapped up in the kid?
A man of 40 ought to've more sense.
I ain't 40! I'm 39!
How old? Eighteen, nineteen.
- They like me! - I knew they would. Anybody looking after you, Miss.
Liberty? He is!
He is.
- I want it!
- I'm sure you do.
You're going to be removed from temptation, Libby.
But the party has hrdly begun. I'll give parties later on.
You come and see me and I'll fix you up.
Why should I come and see you?
Chap's a big theatrical agent.
Oh, I'll come tomorrow.
What time?
We're here.
Sorry, I can't ask you in.
Good night and... congratulations.
For what?
Success story... chapter one.
So what?
Alright then.
So what.
- Hello, old Charles. - Where have you been?
Dancing.
Quiet! They'll hear you. They, they...
You don't get out of this like that, you don't.
What do you mean by stopping up till all hours... to leave Maud and me up.
Who asked you to do that?
I never asked you to do that. A light woman!
That's what you're turning into. But I won't have it, see?
Should have I to lock you in! Awh, shut up.
What's up?
What's up? We got to have a talk.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
It is morning.
You clear out, see? You are drunk.
I ain't drunk.
And I'll clear out when I know where you've been.
I've only been with Mr. Prentiss.
I'm sorry you sat up, really I am.
But he asked me to his party and I thouht, well, I... Yes, you try another.
What do you mean?
Party me eye.
Party at two.
You say that to me again, I'll slap your face.
Libby... Are you telling me the truth?
Why, old Charles... of course.
I'm sorry.
But you didn't ought to have gone off like that, Libby... all that stuff you talked... and then walking out on me.
Oh, it's...
It's more than flesh and blood can stand.
But I've been out late before... But it's the last time.
We got to have a totally new arrangement..
You're in this room... and me up there... well, that ain't sense.
When I lay awake at night, it's always running me in mind...
The new turn and you, and you and the new turn. Charles...
There ain't going to be... any more new turns.
I'm going on the stage. The agent of Mr. Prentiss is fixing it all up. I told you I'd get there!
I told you!
What happens to me and Arthur and Gentry? You hadn't thought of that, had you?
Well, why should you?
Look here, Charles...
You always said I could act. Now don't stand in my way now I see the chance of a real job.
After all... busking is only foolish.
Are you're telling me I spent my life making a fool of myself?
Well... Well, in a way. You see, old lad...
If we was any good we'd be in the theaters.
Not outside and cadging for coppers.
Better than pinching them!
You throw that up at me? How long have I been working with you?
Ever known me pinch you once, since?
How can I be sure?
Get out! Get out!
I won't get out for I have a right to be here.
Get out! Listen, you...
I'm telling you to... I'll call Maud!
It can't go any longer like this.
I'm sorry for what I said, I didn't mean it.
I won't stand you going away.
- You stay here! - Let go!
Maud! Stop it, you little fool!
I wasn't hurting you.
Listen to me now! I want to marry you.
Will you get that?
Maud, Maud! - What?
- That's it.
I want to marry you, sweetheart.
Have you got out of your mind?
I mean...
I mean you'd better look in the frying pan... hadn't you?
Maud! Maud, Maud...
He came barging into my room... the things he said...
I think he must be looney.
Charles, you ought to come along with us. That's it Charlie! Come and have a good rest.
Now we have got it clear.
First I'm drunk... then I'm looney.
Then I'm toldl to lay down and hush... because it seems I'm only a beggar.
So it don't truly count... what I say or do! Partnership's up, gentlemen.
That goes for you too arseholes. Smashed, finished, washed up..
We'll all starve and who cares? Our leading lady has got a new job.
So I'll get a new job and stop busking.
You think I can't do a man's day out, do you?
I'm a man, I am.
And some of you think is funny... I have to say so.
I think it's funny myself. I'm fed up with the humor of it. Dear old Charles... good old Charles.
Yes, he's good enough to fetch and carry... good enough to feed the cat when the rest of you can't spare the time.
But when it comes to give and take... one can play man and woman... then is good morning, dear Charles... keep on your own side of the street, the gutter side.
Alright!
But it's I who'll say "Good morning", see?
Good morning!
Good morning to you all!
What's the matter with it?
He ​​means it's frightfully, awfully bad.
No, I can't get this, it doesn't work.
Still a great title. Oh, shut up!
If you've got any constructive criticism to give, give it! If not, clear out!
That's right, darling, you tell them when to get off.
You all sit around and you hassle him, and you worry him... How do you expect it to work? - Hello, dear.
Let's hear what you've got. And hurry, because Duchesi will be here in a minute.
- I'm not ready for Duchesi.
- Well, now let me hear it, then. Alright, darling.
It'll be alright for Duchesi, but I can't dance to it.
You want something like...
- Who is he?
- Oh excuse me, Dan Constantine.
But he's good! I ought to know, I used to dance with a man who played the mouth organ...
You remember that tune I used to dance, how did it go?
No, you mean...
Wait... I got it.
I got it!
- To Miss. Liberty. - Thank you.
You know, ever since my early childhood I had this desire...
To express myself.
When Mr. Prentiss discovered me... it was like a fairy tale.
Thank you, dear.
Of course I owe everything to Mr. Prentiss.
And, Mr. Hackett.
And, of course, to our backer, Mr. Temperley.
T-E-M-P-E-R-L-E-Y.
He's been a wonderful... Wonderful...
And how do you like playing with Mr. Duchesi? - Oh, wonderful!
- Wonderful... Be quiet!
It doesn't occur to you that I'm nervous... and I must recite my resume to myself?
Oh, I didn't mean you. I'm so glad you came, thank you so much.
I do hope you enjoy the show. - Hold thumbs for me.
- We will. Just say she is wonderful, boys.
Good luck, babe.
Think you're funny, don't you?
So you've worked up my first night.
The thing's you're fussy enough with rehearsals.
Just me they all ask to rehearsal... just because you want to hear your own songs... sang over, over, and over again.
The trouble's I never can. Not even in the middle of a stall.
Well, it might interest you to know that I've had Jack Temperley... at the back of the gallery for the last nine rehearsals...
- then he said... - You are wonderful! Well, anyway, where would the show be without Temperley?
Problem with you is you got no sense of gratitude. Curtain up, please!
- Curtain up, please! Good luck, Libby.
If you want to know the one person in the show who is wonderful...
Oh, darling! Curtain up, please!
Oh, that's you...
Well, God bless. Bye-bye.
Come on, Muriel, quick.
Oh, why deary... you got a full 20 minutes before your entrance.
Oh, by the way... these are from me.
Oh, it's hot in here.
Open the window, dear.
Mind your voice, deary.
Muriel... I'm inside!
Go, Biddy.
Don't you worry for me. Biddy, please, go.
Get back to Arthur!
Get back to Arthur!
Get out of the way!
Get out! Stupid dog, get out of here...
Get down to work.
Green Eye! Charlie!
Wait for me, Charlie. Cha-Charlie!
Wait for me, Charlie!
Charlie, wait for me, Charlie! - That was Charlie. - Thank you...
Thank you very much! He came to go by, same as last time.
Go away, Biddy! Go home!
Come Biddy, you can go round...
Ok, go after Arthur, or I'll cut your tail off. Now you go!
Look... there's Arthur, see.
Second act coming up, Miss.
Liberty! Oh, I'm hot dear, hold this...
- There you are... - So, did you fuss half an hour?
- Oh, I didn't. - Here... How much time have we got?
Curtain up please!
Hey! Come on dear, quick.
- Take the bracelet. - Thanks. Come on!
Careful, darling!
- Okay? - Darling you are marvelous! Schwartzwein is in the third row.
He's crazy about it.
Are you pleased with me? I told you, you were wonderful.
Wonderful!
You don't know how wonderful you are.
Then I'll be in front.
He's crazy about it! Did you like it?
Like?
Don't you know? I love your present. - Darling, I'm so glad.
- The bracelet is beautiful.
Not nearly as beautiful as you are.
And the next, please?
It was beautiful, Miss.
Liberty. We was sitting on the right. Were you?
You were good in this but you were wonderful in the other one.
Libby!
Libby!
Libby! Libby, Libby, Libby!
Stop that! You let me through!
Libby!
Libby!
What do you think you're doing?
She wants to see me, I know she does!
Yes!
Libby!
- What's wrong here?
- He ​​is drunk! - You come along with me!
- I was only trying to talk to her! I'll lock you in for it!
Oh yes, I will see it!
I'll have your ass for assault!
Now, now, what's going on!
I ​​got assaulted, sergeant. It's a great, fat lie! - We'll see about that!
Come on.... - Libby! Come back tomorrow, please.
Libby!
It was a success, wasn't it?
Who cares? Success makes a difference.
If you let success make a difference to you, you are not a success.
Shall we take it up or... shall we let it ring?
Let it ring.
Success.
Hello. Oh, hello, Jack!
Temperley. I'm not here!
I'm not here!
What? Libby? No, I took her home.
We didn't want to break the party, so we slipped away quietly.
No, I wouldn't dream, it is that...
She's pertty tired.
He's got to came with news, he says.
Has he? Worth a try, but she uses to turn the phone down.
- Ask what time...
- Shut up! - Tell me the time!
- Shut up! What? Jack?
Yes, that sounds very satisfactory. He says they're all wonderful.
What? Hollywood? Already?
I heard they were quick! - Give it to me, give it to me!
- I'll ring you later!
You greedy little fool... you want Temperley to know you are here? Oh, what do I care about Temperly, that's Hollywood!
Take away Temperley...
- take away all of us...
- Won't you tell me what he said? Schwartzwein wants you for Hollywood.
I knew you would.
Oh, you're are superior, aren't you?
Laughing at me.
I'm laughing at both of us. I suppose you're sorry I got a success.
Oughtn't I to be if it takes you to Hollywood?
Well, might be you come too.
Oh, I'm to come too?
But of course! We get married, and then... I'm not going to marry you, Libby.
Aren't you?
Can you give me one reason why I should?
Because you are in love with me. - I am in love with you, but...
- But what? I don't propose to be the next Charles.
Charles?
What that has put into your head?
Oh, poor old Charles.
Charles!
Look here!
Gentry! What you want?
Where is Charles?
I don't know what you mean by barging... if I may say so, into a fellow's bedroom.
Where is Charles?
I don't know how you have the nerve to ask me.
- What do you mean, nerve?
- Don't you know what nerve is?
Then I'll tell you.
Nerve's what you done to Charles.
First, you pinch his pitch... then when he turns soft and lets you come along with us... like if you was a stray cat, and cuts the world for you.... then what!
Then you pinch his ideas.
Then you get the pre-eminent friends and off you go without a word... except a couple of picture postcards to Maud from Scarborough.
Look here! I don't need to, I took your measurements the first time I've seen you.
Anything more to say?
Well Sir...
Not to trouble you with my life's history... I was born in a circus but I preferred the classics.
I am a professional reciter, see?
Would you like to hear me?
What would have?
Hamlet, Green Eye, If...? "If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs...
"and blaming it on you...
That's enough. It was a small "bona fide", Your Worship.
Is anything known about him?
- Well, Sir...
- Well, Sir... there is no denying it... convictions have mounted up something awful... 24 all told.
Only 19, Your Worship.
Only 19? Oh, I see... you are not reckoning the admonishments.
Quiet!
Have you any explaination to give us... to why you were hanging about the theater, drunk?
Well, Sir, why not?
I mean... There she was inside... and there I was outside.
'cause I knew she had it in her from the start... for all her swing.
So I came back at the end... just to watch her!
And watching her, I realized... for the first time I'd lost my 'joie de vivre'.
So I hit out. Sorry I beat him.
It done me good at the time.
You'll have to go to prison for four months.
Four months?
I'm giving you four months partly to let you have the chance... to think things over... and try to do better when you come out.
Do better?
I will!
I'll go in for a new job, altogether!
Can't you see where you're going?
Oh, I say, I'm awfully sorry.
My fault, really.
Thank you.
Steady old man!
Thank you!
Taxi! Won't keep you a minute, madam.
Buy a match, lady?
- Charles!
- Don't! Uh, I say, Libby!
What a get up!
What are you...? Charles, how dare you?
Your taxi, madam.
Take car my man, take care... can't you see the poor fellow is blind?
Blind my foot!
In you get... with... you!
You get us to St. Martin's Lane!
I'm ashamed of you, that's what I am! I leave you as a respectable man and what do I find you've become?
A scammer!
I didn't! I wasn't! But today was the first time.
- That's your story. - Muriel, stockings, come on dear.
I tell you I did it for luck...
I only came out last week.
- And what hospital?
- Clink. Prison?
You?
So you could't even fool the police, eh?
You haven't got it right.
I have got it right!
Here I slave to do you credit... and what sort of credit do you to me?
You! Here.
- You, look at yourself in...
- In the frying pen. I ain't forgot.
So you didn't!
Now look who's having a trouble, go on. Here!
You're a jail-bird, you ain't shaved for a week... you done an all lot of babbling and... you've been drinking.
You didn't leave much else to do, did you... you proved to me I was a washout.
How can you tell such wicked lies? You did, Libby!
Charles, dear... Oh, Charles, what have you got into your sad head...
I never said it and I never thought it!
You did, Libby. Oh well, and if I did it... it was 'cause I lost my temper, and I yell.
Muriel, those stockings, come on...
Just 'cause I paid you back in your own coin, you leave... poor old Arthur and poor old Gentry strangers... turn your back on your home, and the cat... and respectability... all to satisfy your wicked pride and self-esteem.
Why, I might have dropped dead into the gutter for all you care.
Never thought what I'd do, well did you?
Oh, I tell you...
When I see you with your packing, with your... poor silly artists.
There I go spoiling me makeup, and I got a rehearsal in two minutes.
Oh, Charles...
Charles...
You keep me out... now he is out...
Come back to your old job... and be Charles again.
Libby, could I have a small drink?
How long has this been going on?
Along's what been going on?
These small drinks of yours. Don't know.
But it's got to stop, see?
You can have this one... but no more.
Charles...
Charlie! Charlie, turn around and talk to me.
Charlie.
There's a cut in a small part going in the new show.
If you can play a blind man... good enough to fool me for half a second...
- You want me, do you? - Yes! Yes, what about coming down to rehearsal... and show them all what you can do eh?
Eh? How can you know what I could do.
Not suitable.
Of course it is.
Yes, what about "Green Eye"?
Enough "Green Eye".
What about "If", Charles? Dear old Charlie, what about "If"?
I haven't done "If" for a long time.
Why, it's easy. I know it.
If you can keep your head... when all about you are losing theirs... and blaming it on you...
- See? - Easy, easy... that ain't the way to do it, my girl!
You got to get them in the mood from the first word, see!
You want to attack!
"If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs...
"and blaming it on you...
"If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you...
He has to have a part, or I'll walk out...
It's alright, darling, we'll fit it in... "If you can wait but not be tired by waiting...
"or, being lied about...
"don't deal in lies...
"or being hated... "don't give way to hating...
"And yet don't look too good... "nor talk too wise.
Order, please.
"If you can dream...
"and not make dreams...
"your master. "If you can think...
"and not make thoughts...
"your aim... "If you can meet with Triumph... "and Disaster...
"And treat those two impostors...
"just the same... - "If you can...
- He ain't so bad, is he? Darling, he's a disaster.
"Twisted by knaves...
"to make a trap for fools... "Or watch the things you gave your life to...
And...
"and stoop... "and build 'em up...
"with worn-out tools.
If...
"If you can make one heap of all your winnings...
"And risk it...
"on one turn of pitch-and-toss...
Tommy, bring here a cup of coffee.
Let's have a bit of quiet, I won't have him interrupted.
As I never had him in any way. Go on, Charles. Go on!
"And lose...
"And lose...
"and start again..."
What? "and start again..."
"and start again...", Charles.
"and start again...
"at your beginnings...
"And never breathe a word about your loss...
"If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew...
"To serve their turn...
"long after they are gone...
"And so... hold on... "when there is nothing in you except the Will which says to them...
"Hold on!"
It wasn't any good, darling.
You can't make me an actor out of me. I've been outside... too long.
Woah, I am a busker, see?
It's alright. Don't worry about me.
Charles! Charlie!
Dear Charles! Here! Why do you...
Charlie! Charles, wait for me!
Charles! Look, is he something?
No, no, he's not. Excuse me!
Charles!
Charles! Charles!
Charles! Charles! Charles, please don't go, please!
Autograph, Libby.
You're a silly little kilt, aren't you?
You always was.
And stop hugging me. Why... Now you've got to behave, you know?
Charlie! Charles!
Don't interrupt your turn for me. - We started now, Charlie!
- Do it! Ladies and gentlemen...
I will now recite to you... a poem, first made famous by Mr. Bramsby Williams...
Since then recited on various occasions... by Sir John Martin Harvey...
Mr. John Gielgud... and myself!
LEE SHERIDAN, FLYING MERCURY OF THE STATE, CHOSEN TO WIN THE DECISIVE RACE
It's in the chat, Mr. Sheridan, Lee has already won the race.
That's it, boy.
My son will win, I bet everything I have on him.
That's if I had the money. We have to get the headline ready soon.
We are delaying printing.
We will only run after receiving the results from Topeka.
When Lee wins those rednecks, he'll value State College.
Our regular readers will no longer be regulars if you have to wait until Monday to read the Saturday paper.
What only worries me is the sponsors.
You know how he is, stubborn as a mule.
But I will try.
We've had a little delay, but we'll be shooting any minute now.
No, you're absolutely right, but I guarantee it won't happen again.
The newspaper will arrive punctually from now on. Yes, see you later.
Dan, your sponsors will let you down if the issue doesn't take the three-way train.
Can't do that.
Besides, they're complaining about back pay. It's not fair.
Send them... No, say I'll pay on Monday.
Say I apologize for making them wait.
This way is better. Now tell us what the headline is for us to run.
Lee Sheridan breaks record. We already have this one in stock.
Entï¿½o use.
We can cut the governor's speech...
The local farmers may be out of the loop, but their son they know.
Lee Sheridan wins at football, Lee Sheridan wins regatta,
I always wondered what the other seven were doing while Lee rowed for glory.
Listen here Steve....
It could be from Topeka. Alï¿½!
Alï¿½, Lee.
Hi Dad.
They're all in position waiting for me.
The world record is 46.4.
I don't think I'll break it, but...
Listen, Bill is here.
Wait until I get back. Hold it.
I'll be back in approximately 46 seconds.
Hey, Sheridan, are you going to run or not?
Calm.
Even if it starts tomorrow I would catch up to them.
Ah, ï¿½? How about, Lee, do you think you're gonna win?
If there's someone better than me, they'll go down in history.
That's how you talk. Take a look at me.
Can you hurry, Sheridan?
That's what I intend to do once I shoot.
In position.
Get ready.
Sheridan in second.
Run, Read!
Come on, Lee, move those legs, you're falling behind.
What happened to him?
Must have broken his leg.
There he goes.
Come on, Lee, come on!
Tï¿½ two meters ahead.
It's ahead now.
Too easy, friend.
Too easy. It was magnificent.
Hi Dad. Of course I won.
47 seconds exact.
Forty-seven seconds? Uncle slow why?
How could I break records with these slugs?
LEE SHERIDAN
-ALMOST- BREAKS RECORD 400 METERS IN -46- 47 SECONDS.
What was it, why didn't you break the record?
How could he break records with those slugs?
Did you call? Yes.
Thanks.
Maybe I'm the only person besides your father who believes that the University of Oxford would tolerate him for more than a semester.
Oxford?
What does this have to do with me? I studied three years at Oxford.
I still do.
Okay, but...
I also let myself be fond of other things and one of them is you.
Let's get straight to the point. I got you a scholarship to Cardinal College.
Where is it?
Cardinal is one of the many faculties that make up the University of Oxford. I mean...
You mean I'm going to Oxford? Yes. How wonderful.
Wait, their football is different from ours, isn't it?
I think it's partly our fault if your view of education is a little skewed.
We allowed the classroom to become an adjunct to the studio.
But we managed to put Lakedale on the hot seat, didn't we?
You won't have that problem in Oxford.
Surely, in the time that remains of these admirable sports
You will gradually realize that Oxford is also a center of studies.
It's not the studies that worry me.
I'm graduating with distinction, don't forget.
I hope you stay in Oxford long enough to prove your academic skills.
When they see me running or paddling they will beg me to stay.
If Oxford and you survive the first shock, it will be a beautiful experience for both of you.
I know your father likes it.
It was good while it lasted, but I think Cardinal will have to do without me.
why? I have to help my father at the newspaper.
He worked hard to pay for my college. I know your father very well.
I wouldn't want you to miss out on such an opportunity. I will speak to him. No, no.
I prefer not. I think college is gone.
But it would be fun to teach those soldiers a lesson.
Bomb him, Dan.
Good Morning. No what are you thinking?
Nothing, nothing special. Why did you call me?
I have a bank to run.
He knows how to work alone.
He can sit on his ass here and it's all the same.
Speak soon. What's the problem?
Actually, I'd like a loan.
What size? About two thousand.
Two thousand?
Have you been doing something stupid... at your age?
Just think about it, Ben, as usual.
The money is to send Lee to Oxford.
what?
I don't give a penny to this crazy idea.
He has to start working here.
Whose son is it?
Yours, unfortunately for him. I educate him the way...
Spoiled like he is, he won't do anything.
He already thinks he owns that college and the whole city.
You won't tell me what I have to do.
Someone has to say.
If you still have any sense, you'll send Lee to earn his own money.
Get him to sell advertising space for a commission.
That will suit him. I don't need to fix him.
I know him and the blood that runs through his veins.
What's blood got to do with it?
What does blood have to do with it?
It's one thing.
The first Sheridan to set foot in this country was in 1675 bringing with him a typographer.
And since then that's what all Sheridans have lived and died.
And they die of old age, around 85.
Lee is a Sheridan, so he still has about 62 years left.
Enough time to settle debts with people like you, short-lived failures that we don't know how hard to deal with.
The boy has blue blood in his veins.
And do you know why it's blue?
Printing ink, which will end up showing when the time comes.
He will show service like all the Sheridans before him.
And even better, because you will receive a better education.
And talk about fixing it.
Get the hell out of here.
Go back behind the bars of your bank where you belong.
Do you want the two thousand in cash or check?
LEE SHERIDAN GOES TO OXFORD
Guys, wait aï¿½!
We rooted enough for old Lee.
But this will be the last time, so let's make sure he never forgets.
L-A-K-E-D-A-L-E
L-A-K-E-D-A-L-E
L-A-K-E-D-A-L-E Sheridan.
Sheridan. Sheeee-ridan.
O-X-F-O-R-D
Cheerio.
Dear colonists... my stay in your country has been excellent seeing their peculiar customs up close meeting the natives and learning their language.
But now that I need to get back to civilization...
You'll have enough time when you get back.
Don't forget to always write. I have a column reserved for the newspaper.
Don't miss out on us, Lee. And how could he, after all he's done.
I even wish Dad hadn't taken out that loan.
Don't worry.
I'll make up for it by beating him at poker.
Goodbye, Lee.
Goodbye, Mr. Williams.
Thanks for everything.
Remember that Oxford is old, don't try to change it too much.
At least as soon as it arrives.
The time has come.
Don't worry.
Go, son.
Extra!
Extra!
Read everything.
Multidï¿½o says goodbye to Lee Sheridan!
At least today your newspaper was not late.
Excuse me, how long is it to Oxford?
Not bad for those little English trains.
We are quite satisfied with them.
In fact, they have to be small. The country is small.
It would fit all state of Nebraska.
No doubt. But to what end?
Please don't misunderstand me.
I'm going to Oxford.
I am very happy to go to Oxford.
At first it might seem a bit stagnant to me, but I'll get used to it.
And I must add that I was lucky enough to graduate from Cambridge.
Good afternoon.
He heard?
Looks like some college is in for a nice surprise.
Cross your fingers, it could be Cardinal.
God forgive me.
What about Paul, good news for Cardinal?
No, our human material is the weakest of all.
Before we had a good runner or rower.
Do we really need to talk about such a boring subject?
Of course, you are above these things. None of that.
I just think it's obvious that some run faster than others.
That's the problem, ours don't run.
Sorry to interrupt, but I have good news for you.
How?
I happen to be an athlete and I'm on my way to Cardinal.
He's going to Cardinal.
We should have noticed.
How lucky we found each other. Providential.
It's nice to have someone to talk to.
My name is Lee Sheridan, I'm American.
I see you're worried about the races. Well, you can rest easy, that's when I come in.
How great. What do you do?
Before leaving I won the 400m in 47.
47? I imagine it's seconds.
Exactly, and it wasn't even tight.
I don't see him in grips.
This was good.
What is your name?
Sorry, unforgivable on my part. I'm Paul Beaumont.
How are you? Sr. Ramsey, Sr. Wavertree. Como vï¿½o?
Sr. Lee Sheridan, da Amï¿½rica ...
It certainly does more than run. Yes Soccer.
How is your football?
We have two types, rugger and soccer.
Do you know how to play either one?
Or both?
No, I only know how to play football.
I got two touchdowns a game last season.
Must be quite an athlete.
You can say. A gift from the gods.
We could use it in rowing too.
Too bad he's not a rower.
I only rowed three years for Lakedale, nothing more.
He could have made it to the Olympics, but he lacked a sponsor.
You must certainly suffer from moments of extreme tiredness.
Our Eton rowers will be able to help you a lot.
I can't imagine those guys paddling with their stiff collars.
Your college must miss you terribly.
No, they're all very nice.
They said goodbye with the band and everything. Gang?
From Paul Whiteman, by any chance? Wait, what is it called?
Lee Sheridan.
Lee Sheridan?
How much distraction, vocï¿½ ï¿½ or Sheridan.
Why didn't you just say so?
The Sheridan for whom the faculty prepared the party at the station.
Of course, Sheridan.
That Sheridan.
Will you welcome me with a party?
Of course, it was in all the papers.
Ah, it can only be my dad's doing, the smart-ass.
It would be better if he didn't show up.
As well?
I'll tell you something.
Whenever an athlete is received in this way he ends up becoming unpopular in the other faculties.
It gives the impression that we are bragging.
It starts to be seen as the devil himself.
Many had to interrupt their studies because of this.
But if they're waiting for me, I can't help it. Yes he has.
Take my advice and jump into Didcot. Where is it? A station near Oxford.
But won't they be resentful?
Now, have you ever seen anyone reproached for his modesty?
Maybe they're right.
If you want it that way, fine.
Ah, the fairest of the Beaumonts.
Olï¿½. Olï¿½, Molly. Sit down, I won't be long.
Meet Mr. Sheridan.
My sister.
Very pleased to meet you. How are you?
You're American, aren't you? Yes, how did you guess?
Sixth sense, perhaps.
Mr. Sheridan is a famous athlete.
Maybe you've heard of it.
Sorry, but I don't think so. Studies Ancient History at Oxford.
You only know people who are over 300 years old.
Things are getting better. I didn't know there were such beautiful students.
Thanks. There's something much better.
Miserable. They're too young. They don't know how to appreciate women.
Well, then you've just found one you like.
Tell me, do you have time to shake?
shake?
Gï¿½ria to date, court, walk hand in hand with a boyfriend.
I don't think I've done much of that yet.
Well, you should try it. End up getting addicted. You're in luck, Molly.
You'll see he's a lot of fun.
Certainly.
Look, this is where you jump.
Ah yes.
I think we'll have to part ways.
I thought you were going to Oxford. And I will, but through the back door.
I want to avoid the reception. Yes, Molly.
In his honor.
And you are absolutely right.
Too bad not to continue the trip.
See you later.
To avoid disagreements, wouldn't it be better to go together?
Good idea.
You're making a mistake, Sheridan.
Then don't say we didn't warn you. It will be a moment of pleasure and the rest of your life to regret.
I'm right.
See you later. See you soon. See you soon.
I'll talk to the beacons.
What are you up to?
Don't worry, Molly.
You can rock with me. why? I didn't see anything wrong with him.
Of course, you're just another talkative American.
Like all foreigners, he just wants to make a good impression. impression? It caused damage.
Be careful here. why?
Something tells me he can become a perfect enemy.
Look at him there. How far is it from Oxford?
16 quilï¿½metros. 16 quilï¿½metros?
Is there nothing closer?
Here we are.
You can go down. Cardinal stands there.
So that's it, huh?
Pretty, isn't it? I hope you like the new colleagues.
Although I don't understand your language, thanks for the ride.
Oops, the reception committee.
No, this is the Salvation Army!
I'm Lee Sheridan.
I'd like to go to my room before they know I'm here.
Head to the archway on the left.
Cross the courtyard.
See the name on the door.
Excuse me, is this the Sheridan of America?
Yes. I'm Masterson, chairman of the reception committee.
You managed to catch me, huh?
Welcome on behalf of Cardinal College.
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Hi guys. Sorry, Sheridan, I couldn't stop them.
We could not disappoint them.
That's fine with me, as long as the other faculties don't mind.
You tried to avoid it, that solved the problem.
Alright then, let's go.
Nice to see you, Sheridan.
We were all waiting for you.
I think my father did it, the news really got around.
Didn't I tell you? Don't be modest.
Order please. the dean. ï¿½ Wavertree.
He and Beaumont met him on the train.
Is he part of it too?
Sure. And after being introduced you will have to give a speech. mind?
Of course not. How cool, huh?
Mr. Dean, let me introduce Lee Sheridan from America.
Welcome, Mr. Sheridan. Thank you sir.
Please drive Mr. Sheridan is chair of honor.
This way.
(in Latin)
Mr. Sheridan, I'll give you the floor.
Gentlemen...
For the first time I understand what it means... old English hospitality.
I was sure you would get to know the true sense of camaraderie and fairplay here.
I met Mr. Paul Beaumont. Your friend, Mr. Wavertree.
We Americans also have an old tradition. frankly.
And it will be with the frankness of this foot of mine that I will give the change.
This foot is capable of kicking an arach dean into space.
I hope you don't hold any resentment.
Where are my eyeglasses?
Take that boy. Who is responsible for this atrocity?
I didn't see your face, sir.
For you will be disconnected from this faculty.
How absurd!
There!
Perhaps a sudden act of rebellion against authority.
I saw you from the back and...
Well, sir, it was an impulse.
A brutal, primal impulse.
Brutal and pri ...
Entï¿½o?
Do you confess that it was you and not Wavertree who committed this insane act?
It is, huh? Sr. Wavertree.
I don't pretend to understand what drives a shy, harmless boy like you.
to assume every act of indiscipline in this faculty.
Look, sir... I don't see anything.
As soon as you receive your apology letter I will decide whether your state of mind warrants a medical board opinion.
Come in, come in.
How is it justified?
It's that all butts look the same in these clothes
I thought yours was someone else's.
Other... May I know who was to be honored?
What buttocks are so similar to mine?
I prefer not to name names, but let him not mess with me.
One more burst and it will be off.
That means expelled, doesn't it?
Yes. Sent out immediately. Go to your room and write a letter of apology.
If possible, in English. Yes sir.
Oh, perdï¿½o.
Sr. Sheridan.
I think in theology it is what is called the bringer of evil.
A provocative person who induces others to temptation. Summing up.
Quietly, I must confess that I don't like you.
Good day sir. Good Morning.
Olï¿½, Sheridan.
What were you doing there?
Was he trying to clean up his act by taking my blame? No, actually it was out of pure selfishness.
I have an uncle who was disconnected from here in '98.
Leaving here in an inglorious way, he will die happy.
And you get into the money. ï¿½ that aï¿½. Why don't you slap him at once?
This would guarantee your expulsion. Wouldn't it be a little forced?
Besides, I don't think I would have the guts to do that.
For that, I count on the support of more creative spirits.
You can count on my creative spirit,
Are you the Sheridan of America and Didcot?
If you must know, I thought Didcot was a very bad joke.
Well, I found it very funny.
We had fun all the way to Oxford.
What did the dean do to you?
I wasn't in the mood for jokes either.
He is known for his bad temper.
He is kicked with the best of intentions and is annoyed.
Miracle not have turned off.
I wouldn't have called. Too bad you didn't.
Just imagine the national repercussion it would have.
Arrives at 3:00 pm, entertain college until 3:30 pm kicks the dean at 3:35 pm and is expelled back to America at 3:40 pm.
All in less than an hour.
Are you trying to get rid of me?
On the contrary.
It would be fun you-lo here waving.
I tried to teach that word to my teacher but she has locked herself in her room with a Chinese dictionary, if she doesn't open the door any further.
When I met you, I even thought you were cool.
I almost grabbed him by his coat so he wouldn't jump on Didcot.
What stopped you? Paul would have been furious.
Poor Paul, isn't it?
It's true.
Well, I don't want to arrest you.
It's better to run to break another record.
Listen here, my precious, save your English, I'll run out of here.
Of course, running with your tail between your legs.
no. I'm walking.
And if it doesn't come again, as I hope, take this to remember me.
MS. Beaumont, this is no place for that.
It will be held for a week.
If you were more observant, Ms. Pinsent, you would see that I didn't kiss, I was kissed by force.
Among.
Yea? How can I serve him?
What is this, another joke?
How, sir?
Who is looking for, some indigenous?
I'll find a way.
It will be like new when you return.
No need to bother.
It's no hassle.
You must know little about Oxford.
I've seen everything I wanted. Well, that wouldn't be possible.
One day it doesn't. It would take years, in fact.
And there's always something new.
Something you didn't notice before. It's something that gets involved.
Because it will need to involve a lot in my case.
That's not how it works.
Oxford is too old to do things in a hurry.
The Cathedral, for example. Some parts were built a thousand years ago.
That's a long time.
is that over there?
Not that one is the Magdelon Tower.
Linda tambï¿½m, nï¿½o?
Until it is.
You know, it's one of my favorite spots.
I always stop by when passing by at night.
It's like visiting an old friend.
I will also meet many friends soon.
Well I'm in need of some. Are you hearing those bells?
Most are centuries old.
With the same sound as when they were forged.
You know, sometimes I seem to see Sir Walter Raleigh.
and many other gentlemen of the time here in this room, leaning out of that window and listening to those bells.
Exactly like us. It's the feeling you really have.
Some students when they come back say that the sound accompanies them all their lives.
I bet the same will happen to you wherever you are.
What makes you think so?
I have served many lords in my life.
I can usually tell which ones like Oxford.
When that happens, Oxford reciprocates in kind.
I'm sorry I talked so much that I neglected your suitcase.
Wait, Scatters.
Can stop. This is...
I get it, I get it, sir.
You may come in.
Looks like you'll be my tutor, sir.
I have to mark where I left off.
Otherwise, I never find it again.
Well then.
They sent me to speak with you to find out about my tasks.
Well, Mr. Jenkins, what are you reading?
No, no, I'm talking about studies.
What is your area of ââinterest?
Apparently I'll have to specialize in boxing.
Very good. I would advise rowing too.
I root for Blue. I remember when I competed against Cambridge...
But as for your studies, Mr. Jenkins...
Where to start? I would like to major in journalism.
My father has a newspaper.
Now, my dear, Oxford does not regard journalism as a serious study.
I intend to major in American History
My goodness, we have little to offer in this area to occupy it for 3 years.
How about American and English History? I think it's a great suggestion.
It is an unfortunate choice.
In my opinion, since the fall of the Roman Empire nothing important has happened in the world.
What is your honest opinion of Cleï¿½patra? Cleï¿½patra? That was a great woman, young man.
Perhaps he lacked political vision, but he had his reasons...
We will discuss this on another occasion.
Come back in a couple of days and I'll give you a list of books.
See you soon, Mr. Jenkins. Sheridan, sir.
Yes, of course, I will take note.
Let's see... oh yes, Mr. Jenkins.
Sheridan, one moment.
Why, the wandering boys.
So you remember us, huh?
Elephant memory.
It's just that I'm not afraid of mice.
I remember I said I ran.
Tell me where and when I will demonstrate.
Great, there will be a race for new students in half an hour.
I'll enter you in the 400m if you're interested.
Very kind of you. Kindness of you to accept.
You will need your bicycle. Make a mistake.
The others are what you need.
You were extremely kind and I am extremely happy.
The Yankees are coming, the Yankees are coming...
Hey! Look where you're going!
Ei! This is contradictory!
Go to the other side.
What are you doing here?
Look where you're going!
Again?
This crass individualism of yours has got to stop, Mr. Sheridan.
It should be obvious, even to you, that our hand is on the left.
Do you mean that here the wrong side is the right one?
And you're on the wrong side, Mr. Sheridan.
I ask that from now on you make a superhuman effort to avoid me. Yes sir, I will try.
Right there, sir.
I would stay away from him if you are the lord.
Good day sir. Yes. Something wrong with the bike, sir?
No, I had them do it like that so it would keep going around.
How, sir?
Never mind, can you fix it? Of course, leave it to me.
How long will it take?
I'll have to do with my colleague.
I hope it's quick.
Say I'm in a hurry.
Ei, Jim.
As a licensee. Hm?
Hello.
Are you the new store owner?
If you become a regular, who knows?
The idea is tempting.
Do you understand flat tires? With the experience of these last few days, I should.
This one is good.
Well then, in their honor, let's look at this tire.
I would be very grateful.
I don't think you told me your name.
That's because I didn't say.
Lee Sheridan. Mine is Elsa Craddock.
Mrs. Craddock.
Gosh, are you married?
Astonished?
A lot of people stay. My husband and I have a bookstore.
She doesn't look like a bookstore owner.
I sometimes give a little smack.
And my husband is much older than me.
That is, I am much younger than he is.
I bet you don't understand. That I would not say.
You just forget that I'm young and I need to have fun.
You should meet my dean.
God, he's even older than my husband
My husband doesn't understand why I'm so solicitous.
You see, I love helping college students.
Especially the newcomers.
By maternal instinct, no doubt. Why, you're making fun of me.
I'm holding back as much as possible.
Naughty.
Where I was?
That he was too young.
Oh yes, but don't get me wrong.
Claudius, my husband, is a sweetheart.
And it's so smart.
Sometimes read all night.
If you must know, I think the guy is crazy.
Good morning, Ms. Craddock.
We can fix your bike, sir. Be quick, please. It won't take long.
Ready in 15 days.
Fifteen days? great.
I'm only two weeks and ten minutes late for playoffs.
My God, please use my bike.
No thanks, I'll rent one from here.
I would love for you to use mine.
I'll need to return it, right?
You're right. All right, see you soon.
Craddock Bookstore.
Any student will tell you where it is.
Certainly.
All right, everyone in your positions.
Rï¿½pido.
Hi guys.
I'm sorry for being late.
I'm even surprised you came.
Kindness of you to wait.
If you intend to participate in the race, you have to get ready soon. Mess up?
Why, I'm always ready, Mr. Beaumont.
Are you feeling funny?
We English have little sense of humor. Don't worry, you run and I laugh.
You can't run like that.
Ah, I must have forgotten.
What nonsense.
Can you hold it for me?
It can stunt my growth.
This clown has to stop.
It's all to disguise that he doesn't know how to run.
In their positions. Get ready.
You are playing a ridiculous role.
You don't understand anything about racing.
Gosh, the man is a freak!
I still can't believe it.
I don't see the grace.
Cheerio.
We have to admit, he knows how to run.
It's as good as they say.
The last time I tried to cheer him up a little, all that was left was to advertise in the newspaper.
I just wanted to enjoy the glory of her affection. None of that.
Listen here, Elsa... If you can't today, how about tomorrow?
no.
But ask my husband... and see what you think of the idea.
Want something? Oh no...
I... I'll leave it for another time.
Excuse me.
Olï¿½.
Oh dear.
Where you've been, you bastard, I missed you.
How about we go to London on Thursday?
Fifth? I would love.
But I can't go.
Good afternoon. Good afternoon Mr. Beaumont.
Mr. Beaumont, why do you always insist that I come to London?
You know I can't leave the store.
I can go for you, Claudius, dear. Last time you didn't have much success, honey.
Didn't buy anything.
But it wasn't my fault.
Anyone gets lost in the fog.
That's why I missed the train back.
At this time of year there is no fog.
Well then my wife will, Mr. Beaumont.
Thanks.
Your kindness, Ms. Craddock.
It will be a pleasure, Mr. Beaumont.
I'll take the 10:00 train, honey.
Hi, Molly.
For those who can barely read, you've been buying a lot of books lately.
Look who's Talking.
Kissing your American friend in public.
At least he's not married.
Paul, aren't you getting into trouble?
Don't worry about it.
I know how to take care of my life.
Excuse me.
Good afternoon, Miss.
I haven't seen her lately.
Surely my brother makes up for my absence.
He really is very nice, isn't he?
Sometimes I think he's a fool. Can you get me Plato's Republic?
If you look on the last shelf, you might find it.
It's very helpful, isn't it? I try to be.
Here's your bike, ma'am.
Yes, thank you. No need...
Oh, Claudius... I don't think you know my husband.
How are you?
I thought I had rented the bike to a woman who needed to go to the hospital.
That's right, it was his sister.
It wasn't my sister... But you said it.
No, it was my aunt.
Aunt Abby, no relation to Westminster Abbey, of course.
Do you happen to have "Burton's Fifteenth Century"?
Yes, which edition?
The finest with large letters.
Fine with...
Very well. You were smart.
I admire smart men so much.
Always at your service for any tightening.
It feels like we've known each other our whole lives.
Sometimes I am attracted to strangers.
It seems like it was born to help lost tourists.
Here it is, sir.
Better get on with your business, the bookworm is on its way.
Hello.
Are you surprised?
I would say indifferent.
Precisely.
But it was worth it, right? no.
How vulgar exhibitionism was.
And particularly it was amateur.
How so, amateur?
I just felt teeth and mouth.
Everything is fine. You won in that preliminary.
But wait are the main attraction.
Thanks, but that's enough for me.
Why don't you practice with Ms. Craddock?
I'm sure she will cooperate. I wouldn't stay with her even if I won the lottery.
These live ones are as safe as dynamite.
We finally agreed.
There was no time.
Now that we're practically soulmates, how about we have dinner?
Can not wait.
Alone. Well, wait a minute.
It's bad to eat alone, worse than drinking.
My aunt Abby had this habit.
One night she...
I feel guilty for having so much fun.
If I get kicked out... Then I buy college.
I still don't know why I'm here.
You English have always been in the hands of the Sheridans.
During the war my great-great-grandfather captured so many red uniforms that we still use them as underwear.
Ready, sir. We will?
I think so.
Don't tell me no ï¿½ skating championship.
I don't know, I never tried.
I will like to see.
Come on.
How about, huh?
Very well, not even I could do better.
I'll give you two more chances.
Nice partner I went to get. Hold my arm.
I'd rather break my head than let a woman help me.
Better stay seated, huh?
OXFORD X CAMBRIDGE RELAY RACE
There they come. Sheridan ahead.
What a fantastic race.
Isn't Lee Sheridan a glory? Awesome, I would say.
Now, here's your chance, boy.
I was waiting for the occasion.
Don't worry, I'll be expelled soon.
I've been with her a lot lately.
So it must have inherited something from me.
I hope so.
Not feeling well? I'm great, why? So modest all of a sudden.
Am I to blame if I'm so good? There you go again.
I was already starting to like you.
And I thought it was already melting.
So as not to waste time, it was agreed to anticipate the next event.
Who changed that?
All competitors report to the track.
But you didn't even rest. It's just not taking those blue eyes off me.
Both? I wanted to reserve one for the others.
Leave them alone.
I'll take this glove for luck and win. Where can I meet you later? Right here.
You are the girl with a glove.
Beaumont. I'll have to run to Sheridan's place.
But he's faster than me.
You are rested.
Talk to him.
Very well, but he won't like it.
Sheridan, I'm sorry, but you're not going to run.
What story is this?
You heard, they anticipated the race to save time.
What does this have to do with me?
You just ran and they don't want to risk it with you.
I can beat anyone and you know it.
Don't talk to me like that, I have nothing to do with it.
Will you run in my place?
In fact, I will.
I understand.
With the victory of the American boy Oxford and Cambridge draw 3x3.
The 2 km relay should be decisive.
And it will be tough.
You are already in position. In position.
Get ready.
Ladies and gentlemen, Beaumont has replaced Sheridan in the Oxford duo.
Oxford in front with the other just behind.
Oxford does not seem to be in danger. Go Oxford!
That's it!
Run! Go.
Pass the baton and run!
This!
This long-legged boy from Cambridge looks dangerous.
Come on, why are you falling behind?
Come on, what's up, come on!
Damn, there goes our chance.
It makes its last lap very fast.
Go.
You are catching up with your opponent.
What is it? It looks like a funeral procession.
Funny way to celebrate the victory over Cambridge.
They did not consider it a victory.
How?
No, sir.
It's going up to c.
Please stay calm when they arrive.
What do you want?
We want to thank you for the brilliant display this afternoon. I won, didn't I?
It's that there are different ways to win. His manner did not please us.
This is no longer a feud between the two of you.
Now we've all been involved.
I'll smash the face of anyone who wants to face me.
Oh, a prank. Splendid.
We must not interrupt. It must be with Sheridan...
I hope. Sheridan? Which you insist on calling Jenkins.
Ah, yes, Jenkins, last boy.
On this I disagree.
Take, sir, another pair. Anything else sir?
You bet.
For some of these guys, the day is just getting started. Don't take it seriously.
It was a simple prank.
I remember a Prime Minister who went through the same thing.
And he wasn't even wearing underwear.
You can do that with a Prime Minister, but you can't get away with an American.
I want to awaken the beast in me.
Take care, Mr. Wavertree.
You know the lookouts are watching.
You will be welcomed with open arms.
I already told you about my uncle, didn't I?
You and your uncle. Where is Beaumont? Hi, Sheridan.
How about a drink? You must be needing it. Have you seen Paul Beaumont around here, doll?
I believe he's in the private bar.
And look at what he calls me.
I shouldn't have told you, Gladys.
Oh, then she's in trouble.
Excuse me, dear. We will. Paul, please no.
Don't worry.
Coming or not?
I prefer to settle here.
I don't want to be seen in public with you. OK.
Your brute.
Revive, Paul.
Come on, get out of here. See you later, Beaumont.
Paul.
Suma.
Paul, Paul ...
I'm a university student and I'm getting drunk.
Sheridan!
Paul!
Get me out of here.
Are you ok? Are you a member of this university?
I don't understand, Mr. Beaumont.
He insists that he didn't attack Simmons.
Are you sure it was Mr. Beaumont who attacked him? Thank you, everything.
I'm very worried, Mr. Beaumont.
Attacking a guard is serious enough, but denying is unforgivable.
I assure you it wasn't me.
Unfortunately some things have also reached my ears.
Concerning a certain lady.
I heard you were with her last night.
His family is distinguished, his background excellent.
We all thought he would make a brilliant career as a diplomat.
If I get you out of college, I'll kill your career.
You will be fined 20 pounds.
One more violation from you and you will be disconnected immediately, understand?
Good morning Mr. Beaumont.
Paul hid behind the door and as soon as the guard appeared he attacked him.
Hi Molly, what an unexpected pleasure. Where is Paul, still with the dean?
The defendant is still trembling before the jaws of justice.
What really happened?
You were there, weren't you?
Where there's confusion, there's a Wavertree whenever possible.
So tell me what Paul did.
Simply knocked out a guard.
no!
I don't know why I didn't think of it before.
And what are people talking about Elsa Craddock?
It had almost nothing to do with it.
So she was there. Well...
Paul and Sheridan were fighting when the watchman came in...
Hi, Paul.
At last.
Are you ok?
Splendid. 20 pounds fine and threat of termination on next infraction.
Just a little bit for assaulting a watchman.
It wasn't me, it was Sheridan.
Paul! what?
I thought you said you saw him...
What gave you that idea?
I... I think I'll study a little.
But...
I also need to study.
I hope everything works out.
I need to speak to Snodgrass.
So it's like that.
I'm going too.
Paul, it doesn't even look like you.
Why are you defending Craddock?
Everyone knows he was with her. She has nothing to do with it.
I repeat, your friend Sheridan assaulted the watchman.
You always hated Lee. But that's too much.
Too much indeed. My own sister taking me for a liar.
But, Paul, you've been seen.
I understand that Lee was mean to you in the race, but he's already been punished.
You badly eat like that.
And if I had any sense, I would stop dating him. The other day he said he knew how to take care of his own life.
I know too. Very good.
Lower yourself by going out with him. I can't stop it. You can't.
I cut it yesterday because of you, now I regret it.
I think I'll call you for tea. great.
So things become clear.
I knew you were cocky, now I see you're a coward and a liar too.
Coming from you is praise.
I enjoyed hitting that guard... and who will take the blame. It's just too bad I won't kick you out.
There's only one way with you.
Take off your coat. We are starting to understand each other.
I was waiting for this.
What are you waiting for?
What about?
You wouldn't understand, Sheridan.
An Oxford degree is more important to me than spanking you.
Skirt! I knew you'd use your English principles to get away.
Skirt!
Beautiful.
I just gave my condolences to Beaumont.
Don't say.
Very dignified of him. Certainly. Wait a...
You start to think we took the wrong person's pants off.
Shut up, Wavertree, Paul is just annoyed.
It passes. He's nice people.
My room is right there. Come in for a drink.
Atï¿½ logo, Lee.
Atï¿½ a prï¿½xima.
It was nice of him.
Even more so after what we did.
After all, he's not such a bad guy.
I just can't understand...
Come on, cowboy, get down from there.
I'm always carrying you, now it's your turn.
Hey, wait a minute, guys.
Come lend a hand here.
Sheridan is asking for a bath.
You who load the boat.
no. But I'll have to fine you for breach of etiquette. why?
For foisting your scolding on Sheridan during the meal.
Scatters, bring the penalty to Mr. Beaumont.
Very well, sir.
I'll bring you a big one.
I hate wasting food, even this one.
More to table two athletes deserves to be attacked in front of your succulent repast.
We all go together.
I think it left Wavertree. Come on, boys.
ready?
Atirem.
Age and position have their disadvantages.
In my day, I would have been able to hit Mr. Jenkins.
He must be talking about Sheridan, as usual.
Yes, yes, of course.
The penalty, Mr. Beaumont. Do you intend to drink it, sir? no.
You can serve beer for everyone.
Very well, sir. So I drink.
The more they fight, the better it will be for all of us.
The more blood, the more beer.
Peter, how about a singles regatta tomorrow?
why?
To hear the Sunday choirs from the Magdelan Tower.
Yes, of course, I will.
And you, Ken?
Waking up at four in the morning to hear a choir?
Never. Are you coming, Lee?
No thanks. I'll take my own boat.
I bet you won't be alone.
Who will it be with?
Who is she?
Don't say that, I don't care.
I wasn't even going.
No need, we all know. She is very beautiful.
And, if I'm not mistaken, a student at this university.
There was no need to exaggerate either.
Leave Beaumont alone!
All right, Lee.
What is it, do you want to fight your own battles?
Watch out.
Good Morning.
Nice to have you on board. Good Morning.
The pleasure is mine. Listening.
Do you know how beautiful it is?
I still look sleepy.
If that's sleep, don't rub your face. It's a beautiful sleep, the most beautiful I've ever seen.
It's very silly, I hope it never changes.
Better get rid of this trap if I don't want to fall.
Did I say that?
I'm getting more British every day. If my father heard that, he would see stars.
He must be wonderful.
Even being an American. ï¿½, yes.
He also thinks you're cool.
To me? He doesn't even know me. Yes you know.
The postman passes you under the door twice a week.
Then my father cuts you open it.
Then you must know me very well. I would like you to know my city.
Would you like? I would love.
Well, pretend we're in Lakedale. This is McKinley Street.
Up ahead is the Yankee Clipper.
Hello Dad how are you?
Did you like it?
It's a beautiful little town. They must be finding me very strange.
Don't take your eyes off me. That nothing.
They are the nicest people in the world.
Do you remember the story of the young man who arrived in a town and, out of shyness, asked an old man what kind of people lived there?
Nï¿½o, nï¿½o conheï¿½o.
The old man then asked; "What kind of people were there in your land?"
The young man replied, "The best people in the world... the bravest and kindest."
And the old man replies: "Well, come in, that's the kind of people you'll find here."
Wasn't that city Oxford?
Or Lakedale, perhaps.
The moral of this story was for me, wasn't it?
For you and Paul.
I wish they were friends. It's easy to talk.
Paul behaved very badly that night at the Queen's Head.
No, Molly... Paul is not like that...
Talk to him and settle everything.
I can't. Why not? Well...
Molly, I think I need to tell you something I should have told you a long time ago.
You don't know what really happened that night.
We have to run, I'm just in my pajamas under my coat.
The biggest risk is taking her back.
I can't be caught.
It's Paul and he knows who's with him. Don't worry.
But he'll be turned off if he's caught with... her.
It's not so much for him, but he could at least think about his family.
Take me Home.
I don't want to stay here anymore.
Can I finish talking?
Forget it, Lee.
I don't think Paul deserves it. We will.
But it's about Paul.
So I don't want to know.
If you don't want to, I will.
I was chosen to participate in the Bump race by Cardinal and I think we have a great chance of winning this year.
Lembranï¿½as, Lee.
What is a Bump Race?
The first rule of a bump race is this:
Let's say this is the River Thames.
But Lee says they'll row a river called Isis.
In Oxford they call him Isis. Why don't you make up your mind at once?
Here are the boats of all the faculties.
They are all lined up one behind the other.
Why not side by side?
What a silly question.
I don't know either. why? The river is very narrow.
The objective is for each boat to touch the one in front.
That's why they call it Bump.
That I already suspected.
Let's say this one is Lee, on a Cardinal's boat, and the one in front is from...
It doesn't matter, it won't stay long.
Let's say you're from New College.
If Lee pulls over, his will move one position forward.
I need the sheet about the governor...
Easy, take it when we finish the race.
Then you will have to pull over to that boat.
Do you mean that to win the race, you just touch the boats? That's the idea.
This boat has to pull over to this one and this one without letting the one from behind touch it.
If he manages to touch the one in front, the next day...
The next day?
What is it?
Six-day bike race?
No, a six-day bump race. How do you know who won?
If Lee touches every boat in front of him...
There, the Cardinal College faces the river.
On the other hand, if the boat behind you manages to catch up with Lee's and get closer...
Run, Lee, go!
Show them!
It will pull over.
Reme, Lee, reme, reme!
Two more days of this barbarity and I don't know.
Olï¿½, Molly. Olï¿½.
This time, leaning in, Cardinal passes ahead.
I didn't sleep a wink yesterday, and you?
I slept like an angel, flying to first place.
Listen, same tactic as yesterday.
Come on, you can do it!
Fight, Cardinals, fight!
Just a little more, Mr. Jenkins.
Paul! Pa...
Cardinals! Fora, all of you.
Gentlemen. To the King.
To the King.
Gentlemen...
On an occasion like this... nothing more appropriate than to call the one who first took Cardinal to the front of the river our friend and speaker, Mr. Snodgrass.
Gentlemen.
Let's toast together.
As the oldest rower of the Blues present here...
It is a privilege to address you.
Today, when I remember, I see that the greatest pride of my life that's when Cardinal's boat, which I had the honor of being rower, passed in front of the river.
And the saddest moment was when
But this time I believe it will be Oxford that will show Cambridge its stern.
And if this is the case, it will be because of two of our athletes who will certainly be elected to compose the university's boat.
I wish they would speak.
I hope you'll forgive my shyness in speaking.
With only fifteen minutes from Oxford, I gave my first and, if you don't mind, last speech. Thanks.
I now call the captain, Mr. Paul Beaumont.
Thanks. I hope our coach will be proud if we win.
Now I think we should celebrate, as Cardinal tradition calls for, setting fire to the boat.
To have the honor of lighting the fire...
Let's go to Bump's bonfire then.
Please, Mr Wavertree, please.
I hope we can be friends.
I'm sorry, but I choose my friends very carefully.
But I will leave on Thursday together with the team for the final decision.
We'll stay there until race time. But it will come back later.
I know, but it had to end someday.
It better be now.
Don't be silly, let's smile.
I'm trying, but it's not easy to know that a glorious day like this will never be repeated.
Try to be sensible, Elsa.
You have to think about your career.
I've never loved anyone other than you.
And I will love no one else.
But it's true, Paul.
I will always be faithful to the memory of our love, always.
Excuse me...
Looking for something in particular? No, but I seem to have found it.
I shouldn't talk like that, I meant books.
I'm Elsa Craddock, Ms. Craddock. Mrs?
You're surprised she's married.
It's always like that.
In fact, my husband is much older.
That is, I am much younger.
Where is Mr. Beaumont?
Number 10, on the right.
Paul.
Paul.
Paul.
Mr. Beaumont. Let me in.
Open this door or I break in.
What does it means? My wife is in this room.
Open this door. Open it or put it down.
Please Mr. Craddock.
Mr. Craddock, why are you trying to break into Mr. Beaumont?
Open this door! Wait.
Let me take care of that.
Mr. Beaumont, please open the door.
I don't know. It's not here.
Waiting.
I don't have the courage. It will come even if it is loaded.
It's not time to ask.
Now break down that door. You won't let me down, will you?
I would push you for putting Paul in this trouble.
I know it has and I insist on going in.
I know you're wrong, but I can enter Mr Wavertree's bedroom balcony.
Well, do that to undo Mr. Craddock.
What do we do now?
Hang on. What happened to Paul?
You are not.
Vim prevent him. De quï¿½?
My husband got suspicious and said he would talk to him tomorrow morning.
I wanted to let you know to arrange what we would go....
I apologize, sir. So it's the American, huh? I just came here to...
What's the problem?
Mrs. Craddock just came to deliver some books as usual Do you expect me to believe this story?
This is absurd.
I don't want to hear another word.
Well, you'll hear a lot when we get home. And who will speak is me.
I would appreciate it if you could explain this unpleasant incident.
Remember when I first heard those bells, Scatters?
I do remember, sir. Said he would listen to them for the rest of his life.
They say they have a special sound on the day of departure.
I wanted my father to hear them.
And why not?
The regulation allows you to stay another 3 days.
I already sent a telegram to the ship at Southampton. I'm meeting him in London today.
But he couldn't... No, Scatters.
I can't let him come now.
It is easier to explain the situation elsewhere.
But won't you be in London for the race?
No be.
That's what he came for, but... expected to see me inside the boat.
Please call Mr. Beaumont for me.
Tell him I'm going to London and I want to see him before I leave. Yes sir.
Oh, Sr. Beaumont...
I'm sorry, Sheridan, I just heard about last night. Yea?
How about telling me what really happened.
There's nothing more to tell. It was just like that. I find it hard to believe that Elsa has come to meet you.
I understand, but it's too late to talk about it.
no.
There's something behind this and I want to know the truth.
All right, if you want to know.
It's been months since Elsa and I have seen each other behind your back.
He canceled several meetings with you saying he had to stay with Claudius, didn't he?
I imagine it's at Molly's expense too. Don't get her into it.
I once told her that you were an outsider. But unfortunately she believed in you. Good thing we unmasked him in time.
I'm sorry, Miss.
Beaumont does not wish to see Mr. Sheridan.
I'm sorry, but Ms. Beaumont doesn't want to see you.
Spoke to her?
No, she didn't want to answer.
What is it?
What's that, another prank.
No, this time it's your friends, sir.
I knew you were coming to see him.
I've been here for almost 50 years
I only remember celebrating expulsions just once before this one.
The first student ended up becoming governor.
Olï¿½, Lee.
On your arrival you were poorly received but now everyone is gathered at the main gate for a true farewell.
What's happening?
Looks like a stop, sir. I was always stopped.
Take this inside, please. I'll take a peek.
Hey Lee!
Son! Lee!
Hey, Lee!
Get out of the way, that's my son.
My uncle would certainly like you.
And this farewell too.
Want to switch places?
Well I would.
Look.
That's it, Lee.
Excuse me, are you part of the University?
My college is Lakedale.
Lakedale?
Yes, in America. Wants to know? That one is my son.
I'm sorry sir. Feel sorry for what?
Let me help you, sir.
Hey, Lee! Lee! Lee, look at your father here!
Here Lee!
Dad. Dad.
It's just that I wanted to see him.
On top of the world.
Wait, I have to go down.
What is it, are you getting sick?
You don't have to go down, I don't want to get in the way.
I told them to stop!
Now now.
Olï¿½, pai, how are you going? Did you not receive my telegram? no.
I've never seen you so well.
Oxford definitely did you good.
Wait, dad...
Go back there. I hope. No, wait a minute.
Listen, boys.
This is my father. Hi guys.
He came from America to see me row against Cambridge.
And it's better to win. I traveled 8000 kms just to see.
I even have the headlines prepared. "Lee Sheridan rows..."
Just listen, would you mind if we interrupted this parade?
I would like to be with my father for a while.
No, I don't want to interrupt the party. I want to talk to you, far away from here.
What's the rush, Lee?
Okay, if you insist.
I'm here at the hotel...
What's the rush, Lee?
So that's it, huh?
S. Well, it's not enough for me.
It doesn't make sense.
You mean to tell me that all this time you've been writing about Molly, you've been hanging around with this Craddock?
I find it strange coming from you, Lee. What does Molly have to say about all this?
I don't know, I called but she didn't want to talk.
Who, hein? It also strikes me as strange of her.
And ï¿½.
I have to see her but I don't see how.
Let me see... I have an idea.
Write a letter saying you want to tell him something no one else knows.
Come on, sit down and write the letter.
Do you mind being alone?
All right, dad.
Doc Williams would never forgive me if I didn't visit his old college.
Entï¿½o vocï¿½ ï¿½ a Molly.
And you are your father?
I thought Lee was exaggerating, but I see she's prettier than I thought.
Thank you... I'm so worried... Tell me...
What do you think of this whole mess Lee got himself into?
Lee didn't get into any trouble. Don't believe a single word.
We Sheridans really know how to choose our women.
Where is Lee?
Not hotel.
Said he called but didn't want to talk to him.
I should have noticed.
It's the first time he's lied to me.
There must be something very serious behind this.
And I think I know what it's about. He knows? Can we sit down and talk?
We have to think together.
Excuse me.
Good Morning.
I look for a book, something light to read on the train.
Follow me, please.
Here is the fiction.
Everything at a discount. Let's move and close the deal. Don't say.
I bet the boys are going to miss a really pretty hand.
You sir are very kind. It is the purest truth.
Send it to Dan Sheridan at the Mider Hotel.
Hm-hmm. My son studies here, Lee Sheridan, you know?
Conheï¿½o, sim.
Your son is a great man.
Good to hear you say that.
In fact, I should be mad at him.
He's going to get kicked out of college because they caught him with a woman.
Did he say who it was?
I did, but I don't think I remember.
Let me see... I'll get the change.
So you know Lee, huh?
Yes. How interesting.
And you, what's your name?
ï¿½... Sra. Craddock.
Craddock... Crad....
That was the name!
Vocï¿½ seria a Elsa Craddock?
Yes I am. Well, who knew?
Now I see that Lee wasn't to blame.
I didn't know I chose so well. I assure you there was nothing wrong.
Of course not.
I'm glad Lee met a friendly attitude.
Glad you understand. Of course I understand.
But it's a shame he's expelled for having met the most beautiful girl in town.
It's hard for me too.
I've come a long way just to see you win the race.
Of course, you must be feeling terrible. Yes, I am.
I was counting on you to do well here.
I wish I could do something.
Me too.
You know, I was just thinking...
This girl is smart.
If there was a way out, she would know.
I thought a lot...
Very kind of you.
You know, if we think together maybe we'll find a solution.
I wish I could help.
And you will, with that big heart you have.
Nï¿½o? I will try.
Thanks.
A thousand times thank you. You just made this old man very happy.
It worked.
The girl even has some value. Impossible. What value?
It wouldn't surprise me if we found out you have a heart of gold.
Tell me everything.
I know I'm nervous, but it was an ordeal.
Tell the truth? Yes.
But you helped, it's been so wonderful.
Well...
You understand, sympathize.
But it was very brave.
I know what it must mean to you to come here... Thank you...
Even so, I think it's all amazing.
Please don't be annoyed with him.
Not that.
I don't understand why Sheridan took the blame.
You know how men are, they never denounce themselves.
I'm sure your friends never reported you.
Thanks. But I never had to guard against such an accusation.
You may come in.
Did you call? Yes. How are you, Miss.
Como vai, Marmeduke?
Mr. Wavertree, if you are to believe what I have heard, you are responsible for grave offence.
In fact, several, sir. He had a woman in her room at night. Who?
I? No, sir.
This is something I've never done.
It never occurred to me.
Why, Marmeduke, how can you?
It was silly of us, but it was nothing more than a flirtation.
With all due respect, sir, but I don't understand. Don't lie, Mrs. Craddock confessed of his own free will. Everything?
Everything. Everything.
Confessed? Oh... what a relief.
I don't need to lie anymore.
So do you admit it? Yes sir.
Everytime.
I would have, but we Wavertrees always protect the women in question.
Try to use it for good, Marmeduke. You're right.
I won't take up your time anymore, Ms. Craddock.
Thanks. Made me a man, after all.
Mrs. Craddock, for her own good, I suggest she sever her ties with Oxford.
We're leaving. Let's sell the bookstore and move to Aldershot.
He thinks there's good demand there... and there's also the officers' club.
Hmm...yes... I understand.
Well, goodbye. Goodbye.
So I figure Sheridan will be accepted back.
Capable of disorienting anyone with more limited intellectual capacity...
Yes. ... like you. Yes.
Oh, but I assure you, sir... What?
I'm taking into account your sobriety and effort history and the fact that it's almost forming.
Do you think you should, sir?
In these circumstances you will be detained for a week and fined Â£1.
Can go. But sir.
Spare me your thanks.
Good Morning. But...
I said good morning.
I've been thinking so I'm not going to let you get away with it so easily. Listen, Beaumont...
So you don't want to fight, do you? I prefer not.
Can we make peace, Yankee? As well? I just saw Elsa.
He spoke to the dean and confessed.
Then you will be expelled.
Row, you one-shot Yankee. Wait until you get out of here and you'll see.
Put your distance, Jenkins! The name is Sheridan.
Okay, okay, I'll take note.
Come on, Jenkins... that's it, Sheridan!
Come on, you soldiers, let's go to 44.
Oh, that's fine.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Gee, that's swell photography.
Well, we'd better get back to the hotel and get our things packed.
'Cause the boat sails at twelve o'clock tonight.
Not for me it doesn't.
What do you mean?
I've decided to stay awhile.
In fact, if my plans work out right...
I may never go back.
We've got to go back, or we'll lose ourjob at the fish market in des moines.
So what?
There are plenty of fish markets here in Paris.
Garcon!
Oui, monsieur?
Er, another glass of milk.
And two fresh straws.
You know what?
I think you're hiding something from me.
Oh... "Roses are red, candy is sweetâ...
"This is something I've sent you to eat."
"Ollie".
Oh, it's too funny!
But the flowers are beautiful.
Oh, candy!
Who is he?
He's the American guest in number four.
But we must not ridicule his generosity. Really, he and his friend are very kind.
- Mr Hardy?
- Yes, ma'am.
I want to thank you for your photograph.
You're welcome.
And for the beautiful flowers.
Oh, shucks, it... it was just a thought.
And the delicious chocolates.
Well, I thought maybe you might want something to nibble on...
While you were smelling the flowers.
What are you so happy about?
Stanley, can you keep a secret?
- Sure.
- I'm in love.
You don't tell me!
Who is it?
The most gorgeous creature in the world.
Georgette, the innkeeper's daughter.
Well, I don't blame you.
She sure is a swell dish.
She certainly...
Yes, sir.
Don't call her a "dish"!
She's the girl that I'm going to marry.
Get a load of this diamond ring.
Boy, it sure is a load!
Yes, sir.
Say, when are you going to get married?
Just as soon as I ask her.
Why don't you ask her now?
Then we can all go out and celebrate.
That's just what I intended to do.
We'll get cleaned up, and I'll go down and...
Pop the question.
That's a good idea.
We sure will have a lot of fun, now.
You sure can pick 'em. I never saw anything like it be...
What are you doing with that cushion?
Well, I keep on bumping me head.
See?
Move it in front of the window, where you can stand up.
How anyone could be so stupid...
As to stand there and continually bump their head...
Is beyond me.
Ow!
Ooh!
Why don't you stand in the window?
Why don't you mind your own business?
!
What is all this?
A holiday of some sort, eh?
It's this. The girls think he's funny.
Yes, this one. Yes.
But remember, georgette - you are a married woman.
And francois is a little bitjealous.
Oh, papa.
He's not serious.
Oh, yes.
- It's just the American way of having fun.
- Oh, yes, yes. Might be.
Well, run along, you girls.
Back to your work. Come, come, come, come, come, come, come!
Francois!
Francois.
It is so good to see you.
After such a long time.
Why didn't you let us know you were coming?
I wanted to surprise georgette. Where is she?
Georgette!
Shush.
Yes, papa?
Francois!
Oh, darling.
Oh, my darling georgette. I've waited every day, every hour, every minute.
My poor francois.
How I worried about you, way out in that lonely post in Morocco.
Oh, it was lonely. Terribly lonely. But that's all over now.
I've got great news for you.
I've made arrangements for you to join me when I go back.
Oh, darling!
I'm so happy.
I'm so happy, francois.
You must be hungry?
I'll get you something to eat.
Well? How about a nice, cool drink?
Well, that's great.
It'll just put me in the mood.
Yes, sir.
Throw it over your shoulder.
What can I do for you?
My friend and I would like a bottle of wine.
And bring three glasses.
- Three glasses?
- Yes.
We thought maybe you'd like to join us?
You know, I feel as fidgety as a jitterbug.
- You do?
- Yeah.
- What's the matter?
- Well, I'm nervous!
You know, Stanley?
This will be the first time I've ever been married.
Say, now's a good time. Go on, now.
- Why don'tcher?
- No.
Go on - tell her.
What's the matter?
You scared?
I'll tell her for yer, eh?
No - not now.
I know just how you feel. Let me fix it for you.
- I can fix it. Just leave it-â- - shush!
Say, he's got something to tell you.
- Something to tell me?
- Yeah.
He's nuts about yer.
"Nuts"?
Just plain nuts.
Oh, oui.
No, I don't mean that. I mean he's crazy about yer.
He's going to marry you. Aren't you, Ollie?
Go on - start popping!
Tell her.
You want to marry me...?
Well... that is, if you don't mind.
Honestly!
You make fun of me.
No, he's not kidding. He's on the level.
- Aren't you, Ollie?
- Why, certainly.
I was never more sincere in my life.
That's very nice of you, I'm sure.
But that can never be.
Oh, won't you give me one chance, georgette?
Go on. Why don'tcher?
Is there someone else?
Oh, yes.
Very much so.
I'm so sorry.
Well, that's that!
No use crying over split milk.
Well, I guess we'd better be going, eh?
- Come on, we'll...
- You go ahead.
What's the matter, aren't you going out with me?
I want to be...
Alone.
Oh. You won't be long, darling?
No, darling. But it's absolutely necessary I report to headquarters.
Will you be back right away?
Just as quick as I can.
Don't worry about it.
You'll get over it all right.
To think... that this would happen to me.
Just at a time in my life when I needed something real.
Something wholesome.
Something...
Tender.
Why don't you try a nice, fat, juicy steak?
That'll make you feel better, if you have something to eat.
You don't understand.
Get me some smelling salts.
Oh!
That better now?
Get-â- get-â-
it won't come off!
Get this off!
Put some water on my head.
Get a towel!
Ah!
There. Now, is that better?
Make it wet!
Oh!
Oh!
Is there anything else I can do for yer?
Yes!
Leave me alone!
Don't talk to me like that, after all the hospital I've given yer.
Tried to give yer candy an'...
A nice fat, juicy steak.
I've waited on you with your hands an' feet.
Tried to tell you that there's plenty more girls.
You don't have to worry about that.
D'oh!
If I felt as bad as you, I'd go and drown myself.
Stanley, you've given me an idea.
What?
I'm going to follow your advice.
Good.
And drown myself.
Oh, wait a minute, now. Listen I...
I was only kidding.
This is no time for kidding!
I know, but don't you think you ought to think it over?
- Have you ever been drowned before?
- I have thought it over.
And since georgette has given me the air...
I have nothing left to live for.
Oh, don't be silly.
What do you mean "don't be silly"?
!
This is a far, far better thing I do now...
Than I have ever done before.
Well, I...
- Well, goodbye, Ollie.
- Goodbye, Stanley.
Good luck.
Where're you going?
Well, I don't want to get my name dragged into this.
What...?
What's this for?
Now, when I count three - we'll both jump in.
What have I got to jump in there for?
I'm not in love!
So that's the kind of a guy you are.
After all I've done for you, you let me jump in there alone.
Do you realise that...
After I'm gone...
That you'd just go on living by yourself?
People would stare at you, and wonder what you are?
And I wouldn't be here to tell them.
There'd be no one to protect yer.
Do you want that to happen to you?
I never thought of that.
I'm sorry if!
Hurt your feelings, Ollie.
I didn't mean to be so dispolite.
That's all right, Stanley.
Let bygones be bygones.
This is going to be easier than you think.
Now, move this over here for me.
Don't do that!
Are you ready?
Goodbye, Ollie.
Goodbye, Stanley.
One.
Two.
- Ollie?
â what?
I just thought of something.
Listen.
You remember once you were telling me that...
When we passed away, we'd come back...
On this earth in some other form?
Like a bird or a dog or a...
Horse or something?
- Oh, you mean "reincarnation"?
- Yeah, yeah - that's it.
Well, now that we're going to go...
What would you like to be when you come back?
I don't know. I've never given it much thought.
I like horses.
I guess I'd like to come back as a horse.
What would you like to be, when you come back?
Oh, I'd rather come back as myself.
I always got along swell with me.
You can't come back as yourself!
Now come on, and stop wasting my time.
Are you ready?
- Goodbye, Ollie.
- Goodbye!
One.
Two.
Ollie?
Just thought of something.
Do you think the water's deep enough?
Maybe you might bump your head if it isn't. Just...
Well, I never thought of that.
Whew!
Huh!
Termites!
Hey.
We can'tjump in there.
There's a feller watching us.
What are you trying to do, talk me out of this?
I came here to jump in this river...
And that's what we're going to do!
Now you quit this horsing around...
Or I'll jump in without you!
- Don't leave me, Ollie.
- Well, are you ready?
- All right.
- Goodbye, Ollie.
Shut up!
One.
Two.
Pardon me, gentlemen.
What seems to be the trouble?
Well if you don't mind, we're going to jump in the river.
But why commit such a foolish action?
Surely your troubles can't be as bad as all that.
Well, that's what I've been trying to tell him.
All because he fell in love with a dame.
Now isn't that silly?
No woman is worth that.
I should say not.
You haven't seen her.
If you knew her, as I know her...
I understand. But don't forget, there are plenty more fish in the sea.
He's not in love with a fish!
It's a girl, you see she-â- that's just an expression, my friend.
I realise perfectly how you feel...
But, er, you've too much to live for.
Sure, you've got your dog - and there's me.
Life is too precious to throw away on account of...
Some woman who probably isn't worthy of you.
He's right, Ollie.
Oh, she's worthy all right.
But there was another man!
And if I could meet him face to face...
What I'd do to him would be nobody's business!
Yes, sir!
Well... advice is cheap.
Maybe if you'd listen to my suggestion...
Your problem would be solved?
What is your suggestion?
Join the foreign legion.
What for?
To forget.
Say, that's not a bad idea, Ollie.
Better than jumping in here.
You could forget, and all our troubles...
You're right, Stanley.
Thank you, mister - for telling us.
It was a pleasure. Goodbye and good luck.
Goodbye.
Gee!
That's great, isn't it?
Now we don't have toâ-...
Say, we can'tjoin the foreign legion!
We've got to be back in des moines on the 17th.
Well... you ready?
- One.
- Just a minute, Ollie.
Hey, mister?
If we join the foreign legion...
How long will it take him to forget?
No time at all. Just a matter of a few days.
Well, that's swell, then.
We'll have plenty of time.
Great.
Now we don't have to worry about it.
Say, we won't need this, will we?
Right shoulder... arms!
Present... arms!
Order... arms!
Take command, captain.
Lieutenant. Close-order drill for the first platoon.
Very well, sir.
These clothes sure don't fit you very well, do they?
Oh, they'll be all right for now.
We'll only use them for a few days...
Until I forget.
That's right, too.
Left turn.
Left!
Right shoulder... turn!
One step... turn!
Left flank... march!
Right flank... march!
To the rear... march!
Squad turn about - march!
To the left flank... march!
To the right flank... march!
Squad turn about - march!
Right flank... march!
Left!
Halt!
Pardon us.
Well, look who's here!
Hey, Ollie - look.
Well, blow me down!
What a small world!
Well, we followed your advice.
Yeah, but nothing's happened yet. Has it, Ollie?
Show these men to the commandant.
Yes, sir.
Well, we'll be seeing yer.
- Goodbye.
- Take care of yourself.
- Goodbye.
- Don't he look good?
Sure does.
Hey, hey!
When are you gonna have dinner?
Attention!
Er, good morning.
I'll now assign you to your duties.
Reveille at five. You dress quickly...
Make up your bunks and get ready for inspection.
Inspection until seven.
Ten minutes for breakfast.
You drill until one and march until four.
What about lunch?
You'll have that while marching.
You have inspection until six.
Fifteen minutes for mess...
Kitchen duties until ten.
Inspection until eleven, then taps.
That is all.
If we have to do all that, you won't have time to forget.
Why don't you tell him?
Er, how much do we get for all this work?
One hundred centimes a day.
Well, that's not bad.
Er, how much is that in American money?
Oh, "American money"?
It's equivalent to about three cents a day.
Of course, it varies with the rate of exchange.
Well, how much do we get for overtime?
There ain't gonna be any overtime.
If you think...
That you're gonna get that much work outta me...
For three cents a day, brother...
You are crazy!
Is that so?
Ab-soâiutely!
Yeah, and that goes for me, too.
'Cause we don't work for less than twenty-five cents a day.
Do we, Ollie?
Uh, uh, uh, uh... uh!
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm!
Oh!
Phew!
- Come on, get to work!
- What do you think this is?
Get back to work!
Get back to work!
Haven't I got enough trouble...
Without you making it tougher?
Well, it's your own fault.
If you hadn't fallen in love with georgette, we wouldn't be here.
Wouldn't have to...
Will you stop reminding me of that?
Here I am trying to forget, and you keep...
Talking about it all the time!
Now here's another day wasted!
Well, maybe you don't try hard enough?
If you can't forget, why don't you try and pretend to forget?
How can anybody pretend to forget?
Well, I know if it was me, I'd sit down...
And relax.
I'd close my eyes, and I'd concentrate...
And I'd think of nothing.
Wouldn't be long, then. That's what I'd do.
Say, I think you've got something there.
I know I've got something.
Why don't you take a whirl at it?
Now, don't think of anything.
I won't.
I know it's tough, to forget a swell gal like that.
Gorgeous hair, an'...
Lovely eyes.
Beautiful teeth.
Ruby lips.
Gorgeous.
I can see her now.
So can I.
Will you shut up?
!
How can I concentrate, when you keep...
Talking about her all the time?
Now, keep quiet!
Let me alone!
Now siddown!
Hey, Ollie?
If you don't stop bothering me, I'm gonna...
Punch you in the nose.
Didn't I... tell you to quit that?
Ooh!
Ooh... ooh!
You'll hear about this later!
Hey, lads?
When you get through with that washing...
The cook wants yer to manicure them vegetables...
For tomorrow's stew.
I beg your pardon?
You heard.
Well, can you beat that?
How's he think we're going to do all this workâ...
Stanley.
I feel something coming over me.
You do?
A miracle has happened.
What?
I've completely forgotten.
You mean, you've forgotten georgette?
Who's georgette?
Gee, that's swell!
Now we can finish the washing and we can go home.
Finish, nothing - we're going now!
Now yer talking!
Absolutely.
And I found them asleep.
And when I told them to go back to work...
They threw wet laundry in my face!
Oh, they did, eh?
Well, I'll show them what it means to disobey my orders!
- Goodbye. Bye.
- Goodbye.
Gee, I'm sure glad to get out of this joint.
Me too!
- Have you got everything?
- Uh huh.
Now we'll go over to that commandant guy...
And tell him we're through.
And at the same time I'll give him a piece of my mind.
I don't blame yer.
Three cents a day?
Huh!
Left turn.
Left!
Turn out the guard and place them both under arrest!
Yes, sir.
Say, what's the big idea of keeping us waiting?
- Do you know what?
â what?
He's not here.
Well, of course he's not here.
Well, let's go look for him.
Look, nothing!
I'll leave him a note.
Oh, iwouldn't bother to leave him a note.
Just leave him a "ps".
Good enough for him.
Now, he can put that in his pipe and smoke it!
Maybe he doesn't smoke a pipe?
Well, whatever he smokes, anyway.
Well, you've got to be careful about those things.
What'd you say in the note, Ollie?
I said plenty!
And if I could've spelt "raspberry", I'd have told him a lot more!
That'll learn him.
- "Three cents a day"!
- Right!
Never during my army career have I been so grossly insulted!
Just wait till I get my hands on them!
Attention!
"Shine on, shine on harvest moon, up in the sky."
"I ain't had no iovin' since January, April, June or July."
"Snow time, t'aint no time to stay outdoors and spoon."
"Shine on, shine on harvest moon for me and my gal."
Goodbye, goodbye.
I wonder what time the train leaves for Paris?
The sooner the better, for me.
Say, what... which way to the depot?
Just around the corner.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
Let no one pass through that gate...
No matter what happens.
Yes, sir.
Come on.
Say...
We're not going to take a plane, are we?
Huh, I should say not!
I wonder what keeps them up?
I don't know.
But I know what keeps me down.
Me too.
Good old "terra cotta" for me, any time.
Permiscously.
- Francois!
- Georgette, darling.
Now I'm so happy.
At last I am here with you.
Have you missed me?
Every day has been a year, darling.
I'll bring the car for you. You wait here, just a moment.
Could you tell us the way to the railroad depot?
Monsieur Hardy!
Georgette!
So you've changed your mind?
Darling, I forgive you...
Everything.
Say, I thought you said you'd forgotten her?
Don't be silly - how can I forget my little georgette? Aww.
Oh, monsieur. I...
I understand. Stanley - we wish to be alone.
Come on.
Why?
Oh!
Darling!
Ooh!
Oh, this is... oh!
Oh, please... please, monsieur Hardy!
What's the big ideal?
The idea is that this lady happens to be my wife.
Oh, is that so?
Your wife?
!
- Yes, you would-be homewrecker!
- Francois!
Francois, please don't hit him. You don't understand.
Kindly step into the car, my dear...
I want to speak to this gentleman alone.
Now, once more I'm going to give you a piece of advice.
Keep away from my wife!
If I ever see, or hear, of you being in her presence again...
I'll see to it that your worthless carcass lies...
Sizzling in the desert sun, at the mercy of the vultures!
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Hey, mister?
You don't have to worry about us.
We're leaving right now. Aren't we, Ollie?
- We certainly are!
- Yes, sir.
Fall in!
Who's he talking to?
Fall in!
What do you mean, "fall in"?
We're through. Didn't you get our note?
Yes, I got your note, and when you signed it...
You signed your own death warrant.
You're under arrest for desertion.
Now, fall in!
Oh, butâ-...
Throw them into jail, and have the guard...
To keep a close watch on them.
Yes, sir!
Forward, march!
Halt!
Two deserters.
Deserters, eh?
Come on. I'll show you to your suite.
Get in!
Hey, come on here, what's...
Get in!
Don't push me!
Revolution, eh?
!
Huh!
Huh, I'll see you at sunrise.
I'll learn them.
I'll show them where to get off at.
Huh!
But what did we do?
- What did you do?
- Sure.
Why, you know...
What are you?
What, what!
Get in there!
Get... in there!
Hey, mister?
What?
You forgot your keys.
Look.
Why don't you keep your mouth shut?
The prisoners have been found guilty...
And will be shot at sunrise.
There's a nice pickle we're in.
Shot at sunrise.
I hope it's cloudy tomorrow.
- Say, Ollie?
- What?
You still want to come back as a horse?
I don't care if I never come back.
I'll play you another one, now.
Shut up!
Oh!
Oh.
Go to sleep!
Put that thing down!
Huh!
Well, guess we'd better get some sleep.
What?
Get in there.
What for?
Sshh!
Never mind "what for" - hurry up.
Come on and get in.
Need to let a feller know...
Take this candle.
Sshhl.
Now go ahead. Goon
Say, where are we going?
This tunnel leads to the outside wall.
We're making our escape.
Well, are we allowed to do that?
Go ahead!
I was only asking.
"Are we allowed to do that?"
Isn't this fun?
They shan't know where we are.
It sure is, I'm dying with laughter.
Go ahead.
Ooh!
Don't you hit me!
See what you've done?
Now we've got to dig our way out!
Go back to the cell and get those tin plates.
I don't want to go back to the cell.
Will you hurry?
This is our last chance.
Why do I have to always do everything?
Always me!
Me, me.
Put your head down.
Never you!
Bring the prisoners.
Yes, sir.
All right, come on, you. The sun's up. Come on.
Ooooh!
- Gone!
Escaped!
- What?
Give me the commandant.
Sir. The prisoners have escaped!
What?
!
The prisoners have escaped?
- Then find them!
- Yes, sir.
I want both those prisoners brought back, dead or alive!
Call out the entire post, if necessary.
I wonder what time it is?
Now how do I know?
We should be beyond the wall by now.
- Seems like we've been working...
- I guess you're right.
We'd better start digging up.
That's a good idea.
Oh, stop all this nonsense, now. Sshh!
Don't you dare go back to Paris again...
And leave me alone, see?
Darling.
Oh, uh, bring up a bottle of that...
Special vintage wine from the cellar, will you?
Yes, sir.
Oh, dear!
Will you get out of here?
- I'm only trying to help!
- Every time I try to get dressed...
You come in and annoy me. Now go!
I wonder where we are?
Maybe some saloon outside the fort?
See if the coast is clear.
I don't want to see if the coast is clear.
Sssshhhh!
Go ahead.
Open it!
Sshh!
Georgette?
May I come in?
Georgette?
- Yes, dear.
- You all right?
Yes. Fine, thanks.
Oohh!
At a time like this, you had to do that!
Quick, help me get her on the bed!
Get her feet.
Quick, get me a glass of water.
Look out!
Don't do that!
Uh!
What is the meaning of this?
!
What do we say?
You think up your story, I've got mine!
Now pay strict attention, all of you.
The men who were to be shot this morning have escaped.
Be sure all gates are closed, and make a...
Thorough search of the entire barracks.
Whoever brings them back will be given...
The reward of six weeks' furlough.
That's all!
Halt!
Let's cover up the hole.
What?
See if they're gone.
Yeah. We've given them the slip.
Good!
Now let's get out of here.
Hey, Stan!
Look
- I'm over here!
Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into.
Ollie!
Is that really you?
Of course it's me.
Gee, I'm glad to see yer.
What do we care if we were expelled?
The war's gonna start, so we would've left anyhow.
War!
Isn't it exciting, Scarlett?
- Those fool Yankees want a war.
- We'll show them! Fiddle-dee-dee.
War, war, war!
This war talk's spoiling all the fun at every party.
I get so bored I could scream.
Besides, there isn't going to be any war.
- Not gonna be any war?
- Of course there'll be a war.
If either of you boys says "war" once again.. ..I'll go in the house.
- But, Scarlett!
- Don't you want us to have a war?
Well..
But remember, I warned you.
I've got an idea!
We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue at Twelve Oaks.
You're eating barbecue with us, aren't you?
I haven't thought about that yet.
I'll think about that tomorrow.
We want all your waltzes.
First Brent, then me, then Brent, and so on.
- Promise?
- Why, I'd just love to.
If only I didn't have every one of them taken already.
- You can't do that to us!
- We'll tell you a secret. A secret?
Who by?
You know Melanie Hamilton?
Ashley Wilkes' cousin? She's visiting..
That goody-goody! Who wants to know about her?
Anyway, we heard.. They say..
Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her. - Wilkeses always marry their cousins.
- Do we get those waltzes?
Of course.
- It can't be true!
Ashley loves me!
- Scarlett!
- What's gotten into her?
- Suppose we made her mad?
Where are you going without your shawl and the night air coming?
How come you didn't ask them gentlemen to supper?
You got no more manners than a field hand.
After me and Miss Ellen done labored with you!
Come on in before you catch your death of dampness.
No!
I'm going to wait for Pa to come home.
Come on in here!
Come on!
Quitting time!
- Who says it's quitting time?
I's the foreman. I say when it's quitting time at Tara.
Quitting time!
Quitting time!
There's none in the county can touch you, and none in the state.
Pa!
How proud of yourself you are!
Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, so you've been spying on me.
Like your sister, you'll tell your mother that I was jumping again.
You know I'm no tattletale like Suellen.
But after you broke your knee last year jumping that fence..
I'll not have me own daughter telling me what I shall jump and not jump.
It's my own neck, so it is.
All right, Pa, you jump what you please. - How are they at Twelve Oaks?
- The Wilkeses?
In the stew you'd expect with a barbecue and talking nothing but war.
Bother the war! Was there anyone else there?
Their cousin Melanie and her brother, Charles.
Melanie Hamilton is a pale-faced, mealy-mouthed ninny!
Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.
Ashley Wilkes couldn't like anyone like her.
What's your interest in Ashley and Miss Melanie?
Nothing. Let's go into the house.
Has he been trifling with you?
Has he asked you to marry him?
- No. - Nor will he.
I had it in strict confidence from John Wilkes today..
..Ashley's going to marry Melanie.
It'll be announced tomorrow night at the ball.
I don't believe it!
Here!
Where are you off to?
Scarlett!
What are you about?
Have you been running after a man who's not in love with you?
When you might have any other?
I haven't been running after him, it's just a surprise.
Now, don't be jerking your chin at me!
If Ashley wanted to marry you, I'd have misgivings.
I want my girl to be happy. You'd not be happy with him.
I would! I would!
What's the difference who you marry?
So long as he's a Southerner.
And when I'm gone I'll leave Tara to you.
I don't want it. It doesn't mean anything..
Do you mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara.. ..that land doesn't mean anything to you?
Land is the only thing in the world worth working for..
..worth fighting for, worth dying for. - It's the only thing that lasts!
- You talk like an Irishman. It's proud I am that I'm Irish.
Don't you be forgetting.. ..that you're half Irish too.
To anyone with a drop of Irish blood in them..
..the land they live on is like their mother.
But there now. You're just a child. It'll come to you, this love of the land.
There's no getting away from it if you're Irish.
Here she comes!
Scarlett, Suellen, Carreen, your mama's home!
Acting like a wet nurse to them white-trash Slatterys..
..instead of eating her supper.
Set up the fire!
Got no business wearing herself out..
Pork!
Take the lamp out on the porch.
Wearing herself out. Mr. Gerald, Miss Ellen's home!
Waiting on them poor white trash.
Shut up, dog!
Barking in the house!
Get up from there! Don't you hear Miss Ellen?
Get out there and get her medicine chest!
We was worried about you, Miss Ellen.
It's all right, Pork.
I'm home.
Mrs. O'Hara, we finished plowing the creek bottom today.
What do you want me to start on tomorrow?
Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come from Emmie Slattery's bedside.
Your child has been born.
My child, ma'am?
I'm sure I don't understand.
Has been born and mercifully has died.
Good night, Mr. Wilkerson.
I fix your supper myself and you eats it.
- Yes, after prayers, Mammy.
Mr. O'Hara, you must dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.
Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara?
He's the best overseer in the county.
He must go tomorrow morning, the first thing!
- No.
- Yes.
The Yankee Wilkerson and the white-trash Slattery girl?
- We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.
- Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.
I wanna wear Scarlett's green dress.
I don't like your tone, Suellen. Your pink gown's lovely.
- Can't I stay up for the ball?
- You may wear my garnets.
Why can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow?
Scarlett.
You look tired, my dear. I'm worried about you.
I'm all right, Mother.
Why can't I stay up for the ball?
I'm 13 now.
You may go to the barbecue.
I didn't want your tacky dress anyhow!
- Hush up!
- Prayers, girls.
..and to all the saints, that I have sinned in thought, word and deed..
..through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault.
Therefore, I beseech thee, blessed Mary, ever virgin..
..blessed Michael the Archangel..
..blessed John the Baptist..
..the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul, and all the saints..
Ashley doesn't know I love him.
I'll tell him that I love him.. ..and then he can't marry.
Hear thee Almighty, most merciful Lord..
..grant us pardon, absolution and remission of our sins.
Just hold on and suck in!
Mammy, here's Miss Scarlett's vittles.
Take it back to the kitchen.
I won't eat a bite. Yes'm, you is!
You's gonna eat every mouthful.
No, I'm not!
Put on the dress. We're late already.
- What my lamb gonna wear?
- That.
No, you ain't! You can't show your bosom before 3:00!
I'm gonna speak to your ma!
If you say one word to mother, I won't eat a bite.
Well..
Keep your shawl on. I ain't aiming for you to get freckled..
..after the buttermilk I done put on you, bleaching them freckles.
Now, Miss Scarlett. You come on and be good and eat just a little, honey.
No! I'm going to have a good time today and eat at the barbecue.
If you don't care what folks says, I does!
You can always tell a lady by how she eats in front of folks like a bird.
I ain't aiming for you to go to John Wilkes' and gobble like a hog!
Fiddle-dee-dee!
Ashley told me he likes girls with a healthy appetite.
What gentlemens says and thinks is different things.
And I ain't noticed Mr. Ashley asking for to marry you.
Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need a having it come right back up again.
Why is it a girl has to be so silly to catch a husband?
Scarlett O'Hara! If you're not down here by the time I count 10.. - ..we'll go without you!
- I'm coming, Pa!
One, two, three, four, five..
Oh, dear!
My stays are so tight, I'll never get through the day without belching!
Well, John Wilkes. - It's a grand day for the barbecue.
- So it seems, Gerald. Why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?
She's settling accounts with the overseer, but she'll be along tonight.
- Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.
- Thank you kindly, India.
Your daughter's getting prettier every day, John.
Here are the O'Hara girls. We must greet them.
I can't stand Scarlett. She throws herself at Ashley.
That's your brother's business.
You must remember your duties as hostess.
Good morning, girls.
Good morning, Scarlett.
India Wilkes, what a lovely dress!
I just can't take my eyes off it.
Good morning, Miss Scarlett.
You look mighty fine this morning, Miss Scarlett.
It's a pleasure to see you, Miss Scarlett.
Ashley!
Scarlett, my dear!
I've been looking for you everywhere.
I've got something I must tell you.
Can't we go someplace quiet?
Yes, I'd like to, but I have something to tell you too.
Something I hope you'll be glad to hear.
Come say hello to my cousin Melanie first.
Oh, do we have to?
She's been looking forward to seeing you again.
Melanie!
- Here's Scarlett.
- Scarlett!
I'm so glad to see you again.
Melanie, what a surprise to run into you here.
I hope you'll stay with us a few days.
I hope I shall stay long enough for us to become real friends.
- I do want us to be.
- We'll keep her here, won't we?
We'll make the biggest fuss over her!
If anybody can give a girl a good time, it's Ashley.
Our good times must seem silly to you. You're so serious.
Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.
I've always admired you.
I wish I could be more like you.
You mustn't flatter me and say things you don't mean.
Nobody could accuse Melanie of being insincere.
Could they, my dear?
She's not like you, is she, Ashley?
He never means a word he says to any girl.
Why, Charles Hamilton, you handsome old thing, you!
But, Miss O'Hara, I..
Was it kind to bring your good-looking brother here to break my poor heart?
Now that Charles is your beau, she's after him like a hornet.
Charles, I want to eat barbecue with you.
Don't go philandering with any other girl, because I'm mighty jealous.
I won't, Miss O'Hara.
I do declare, Frank Kennedy!
You look dashing with those new whiskers.
Thank you, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
Charles and Wade asked me to eat with them, but I told them I promised you.
You needn't be so amused. She's after your beau now.
That's mighty flattering of you, Miss Scarlett.
I'll see what I can do.
Why's your sister mad?
You sparking her beau?
As if I couldn't do better than that old maid in britches.
Brent and Stuart, you handsome old things! - I didn't mean it.
I'm mad at you!
- What have we done?
You haven't been near me all day!
I wore this old dress for you.
I was counting on eating with you.
- You are, Scarlett.
- Of course you are, honey.
I never can make up my mind which of you is the handsomest.
I was awake all last night trying to figure it out.
- Cathleen, who's that?
- Who?
That man looking at us and smiling.
The nasty dark one.
Don't you know?
That's Rhett Butler.
He's from Charleston.
He has a most terrible reputation.
He looks as if he knows what I look like without my shimmy.
My dear, he isn't received.
He spends his time up North because his folks won't speak to him.
He was expelled from West Point, he's so fast.
And there's that business about the girl he wouldn't marry.
Tell, tell!
He took her out buggy-riding in the late afternoon without a chaperon..
..and then he refused to marry her!
No, but she was ruined just the same.
Ashley..
- Happy?
- So happy.
You seem to belong here..
..as if it had all been imagined for you.
I like to feel that I belong to the things you love.
- You love Twelve Oaks as I do.
- Yes, Ashley.
I love it as more than a house.
It's a whole world that wants only to be graceful and beautiful.
It's so unaware that it may not last forever.
You're afraid of what may happen if the war comes?
But we don't have to be afraid for us.
No war can come into our world, Ashley.
Whatever comes, I'll love you..
..just as I do now, until I die.
Isn't this better than a table?
A girl hasn't got but two sides to her at a table.
- I'll get her dessert.
- She said me!
Allow me, Miss O'Hara?
I think..
I think Charles Hamilton may get it.
Thank you, Miss O'Hara.
Thank you!
Go get it, boy!
Isn't he the luckiest..
Miss O'Hara..
..I love you.
I don't guess I'm as hungry as I thought.
Why do I have to take a nap?
I'm not tired.
Well-brought-up ladies takes naps at parties.
It's time you behave and act like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.
When we were in Saratoga, I didn't see Yankee girls taking naps.
And you won't see no Yankee girls at the ball, neither.
How was Ashley today?
He didn't pay much attention to you.
You mind your own business!
You'll be lucky you don't lose whisker-face Kennedy.
You're sweet on Ashley, and his engagement's being announced tonight.
That's as much as you know.
You ought to behave yourself!
Acting like poor white-trash children!
If you's old enough for parties, you should act like ladies!
Who cares?
We've borne enough insults from the Yankees.
We'll keep our slaves with or without their approval.
'Twas the sovereign right of Georgia to secede from the Union.
The South must assert herself by force of arms.
After we've fired on the Yankee rascals at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight.
- There's no other way.
- That's right!
Let the Yankees ask for peace.
The situation's very simple. The Yankees can't fight and we can.
There won't be a battle.
They'll turn and run.
- One of us can lick 20 Yanks.
- We'll beat them in one battle.
Gentlemen can always fight better than rabble.
Gentlemen always fight better.
What does the captain of our Troop say?
Well, gentlemen, if Georgia fights, I go with her.
I hope the Yankees let us leave the Union in peace.
Ashley, they've insulted us!
You can't mean you don't want war?
Most of the miseries of the world were caused by wars.
And when the wars were over, no one ever knew what they were about.
Now, gentlemen. Mr. Butler's been up North, I hear.
Don't you agree with us?
I think it's hard winning a war with words.
What do you mean, sir?
There's not a cannon factory in the whole South.
What difference does that make to a gentleman?
It'll make a great difference to a great many gentlemen, sir.
Are you hinting that the Yankees can lick us?
No, I'm not hinting.
I'm saying plainly, the Yankees are better equipped than we.
They've got factories, shipyards, coal mines..
..and a fleet to bottle up our harbors and starve us.
All we've got is cotton and slaves, and arrogance.
I refuse to listen to any renegade talk!
- I'm sorry if the truth offends you.
- Apologies aren't enough, sir.
I hear you were turned out of West Point, Mr. Rhett Butler.
And you aren't received in any family in Charleston. Not even your own!
I apologize again for all my shortcomings.
Perhaps you won't mind if I look over your place?
I seem to be spoiling everybody's brandy and cigars..
..and dreams of victory.
That's what you can expect from somebody like Rhett Butler.
You did everything but call him out.
- He refused to fight.
- Not quite there, Charles. - He refused to take advantage of you.
- Take advantage of me?
He's one of the best shots in the country, as he's proved many times.
- He's got steadier hands than yours.
- Well, I'll show him!
Please. Don't go tweaking his nose anymore.
You may be needed for more important fighting.
If you'll excuse me, Mr. Butler's our guest.
I think I'll just show him around.
Ashley!
Ashley..
Scarlett.
Who are you hiding from in here?
What are you up to?
Why aren't you upstairs, resting with the other girls?
What is this, Scarlett, a secret?
Oh, Ashley.. Ashley!
- I love you.
- Scarlett!
I love you, I do!
Isn't it enough that you gathered every other man's heart today?
You've always had mine. You cut your teeth on it.
Don't tease me now.
Have I your heart, my darling?
I love you, I love you!
You mustn't say such things. You'll hate me for hearing them.
I could never hate you, and I know you must care about me.
You do care, don't you?
Yes, I care.
Can't we go away and forget we ever said these things?
But how can we do that?
Don't you..? Don't you want to marry me?
I'm going to marry Melanie.
But you can't! Not if you care for me!
Oh, my dear, why must you make me say things that will hurt you?
How can I make you understand?
You're so young, you don't know what marriage means.
I know I love you, and I want to be your wife.
You don't love Melanie.
She's like me, Scarlett.
She's my blood and we understand each other.
But you love me!
How could I help loving you?
You have all the passion for life that I lack.
That kind of love isn't enough for two people as different as we are.
Why not say it, you coward?
You're afraid to marry me.
You'd marry that fool who can only say..
.."yes," "no" and raise a passel of mealy-mouthed brats!
You mustn't say that!
Who are you to tell me I mustn't?
You led me on! - You made me believe you'd marry me.
- Scarlett, be fair!
- I never at any time..
- You did!
It's true, you did! I'll hate you till I die!
I can't think of anything bad enough to call you!
Has the war started?
Sir, you should have made your presence known.
In the middle of that beautiful love scene?
That wouldn't have been tactful, would it?
But don't worry. Your secret is safe with me.
- Sir, you are no gentleman.
- And you, miss, are no lady.
I don't hold that against you.
Ladies never held any charm for me.
First you take advantage of me, then you insult me!
I meant it as a compliment.
I hope to see more of you, when you're free of the spell of Mr. Wilkes.
He doesn't strike me as good enough for a girl of your.. What was it?
Your "passion for living."
How dare you! You aren't fit to wipe his boots!
And you were going to hate him for the rest of your life.
She certainly made a fool of herself running after all the men.
That's not fair, India.
She's so attractive, men naturally flock to her.
Melanie, you're just too good to be true.
- Didn't you see her going after Charles?
- And she knows Charles belongs to me.
You're wrong, India.
Scarlett's just high-spirited and vivacious.
Men flirt with girls like that, but they don't marry them.
I think you're being very mean to her.
Miss O'Hara!
Miss O'Hara!
Mr. Lincoln's called volunteers to fight against us!
Don't you men think about anything important?
But it's war! Everybody's going off to enlist.
I'm going too!
Everybody?
Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?
To see us go?
I'll cry into my pillow every night.
Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.
You're the most beautiful girl in the world, and the sweetest, the dearest.
I couldn't hope that you could love me.
I'm so clumsy and stupid and not nearly good enough for you.
But if you could think of marrying me, I'd do anything in the world for you.
Just anything, I promise.
What did you say?
Miss O'Hara, I said, "Would you marry me?"
Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.
You will?
You'll marry me? You'll wait for me?
- I don't think I'd want to wait.
- You'll marry me before I go?
Oh, Miss O'Hara!
Scarlett.
- When may I speak to your father?
- The sooner the better.
I'll go now, I can't wait.
Will you excuse me, dear?
Dear!
Mr. O'Hara! Mr. O'Hara!
- It'll be a week before they call me.
- A week till they take you away from me!
I thought of you at our wedding yesterday..
..and I hoped yours would be as beautiful. - And it was!
- Was it?
Now we're really and truly sisters.
- Charles!
- Melanie.
Don't cry, darling.
The war will be over in a few weeks, and I'll be coming back to you.
Miss Scarlett!
I don't care! I'm too young to be a widow.
Miss Scarlett!
Why, I'd just go around scaring people in that thing.
You shouldn't be around people. You's in mourning!
For what?
I don't feel anything.
Why should I have to pretend and pretend?
What is it?
Oh, poor baby!
What is it?
My life is over!
- Nothing will ever happen to me anymore!
Oh, Mother, I know you think I'm horrible.
But I just can't bear going around in black.
It's bad enough not being able to go to parties.
But looking this way too?
I don't think you're at all horrible.
It's only natural you want to look young and be young when you are young.
Oh, baby!
How would you like to visit somewhere?
Savannah, perhaps?
What would I do in Savannah?
Well, Atlanta then.
There's lots going on there.
And you can stay with Melanie and her Aunt Pittypat.
Melanie?
Yes.
Yes, I could, couldn't I?
Oh, Mother, you're sweeter than anybody in the world!
You'd like it, really?
All right, then.
Now stop your crying and smile.
You can take Prissy with you.
Start packing Miss Scarlett's things, Mammy.
I'll go write the necessary letters.
Atlanta!
Savannah would be better for you. You'll get in trouble in Atlanta.
What are you talking about?
You know what I's talking about. I'm talking about Mr. Ashley Wilkes.
He'll come to Atlanta for his leave and you waiting for him just like a spider!
- He belongs to Miss Melanie..
- Go pack my things like Mother said!
They're all whispering, and I know it's about her!
What's it matter, Pittypat?
Scarlett's living under my roof, so they think I'm responsible for her.
And for a widow to appear in public at a social gathering..
..every time I think of it, I feel faint.
You know Scarlett came here only to help raise money for the Cause.
It was splendid of her to make the sacrifice.
Anyone hearing you talk would think she came to dance instead of sell things.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have important news!
Glorious news!
Another triumph for our magnificent men in arms!
General Lee has completely whipped the enemy..
..and swept the Yankee army northward from Virginia!
And now, a happy surprise for all of us.
We have with us tonight, that most daring of all blockade runners..
..whose fleet schooners, slipping past the Yankee guns..
..have brought us here the very woolens and laces we wear tonight.
I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that will-o'-the-wisp of the bounding main.
None other than our friend from Charleston..
..Captain Rhett Butler!
Permit me.
Captain Butler, such a pleasure to see you again.
I met you last at my husband's home.
That's kind of you to remember, Mrs. Wilkes.
Did you meet Captain Butler at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?
Yes, I.. I think so.
Only for a moment. It was in the library.
You had broken something.
Yes, Captain Butler, I remember you.
Ladies, the Confederacy asks for your jewelry on behalf of our noble Cause.
We aren't wearing any. We're in mourning.
Wait.
On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes and Mrs. Hamilton.
Thank you, Captain Butler.
Just a moment, please.
But it's your wedding ring, ma'am.
It may help my husband more off my finger.
Thank you.
That was a very beautiful thing to do.
Here.
You can have mine too.
For the Cause.
And you, Mrs. Hamilton. I know just how much that means to you.
Melanie?
- Dr. Meade?
- I need your approval..
..for something we want to do that's rather shocking.
Will you excuse us?
I'll say one thing. The war makes the most peculiar widows.
I wish you'd go away!
If you had any raising, you'd know I'd never want to see you again!
Now, why be silly?
You've no reason for hating me. I'll carry your guilty secret to my grave.
I'd be very unpatriotic to hate a great hero of the war.
I declare, I was surprised you turned out to be a noble character.
I can't bear to take advantage of your little-girl ideas.
I'm neither noble nor heroic.
- But you are a blockade runner?
- For profit, and profit only.
You don't believe in the Cause?
Rhett Butler is the only cause I know.
The rest doesn't mean much to me.
And now, ladies and gentlemen..
..I have a startling surprise for the benefit of the hospital.
Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the reel with the lady of your choice..
..you must bid for her!
Caroline Meade, how can you let your husband conduct this slave auction!
Darlene Merriwether, how dare you criticize me!
Melanie told the doctor that if it's for the Cause, it's quite all right.
She did?
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Where are my smelling salts?
- I think I shall faint.
- Don't you dare faint, Pittypat!
If Melanie says it's all right, it is all right.
Come, gentlemen, do I hear your bids?
Make your offers!
Don't be bashful, gentlemen!
Twenty dollars! Twenty dollars for Miss Maybelle Merriwether!
Twenty-five dollars for Miss Fanny Elsing!
Only $25 to give your..
- One hundred and fifty dollars in gold.
- For what lady, sir?
For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
- For whom, sir?
- Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning.
But I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles would be proud to..
Dr. Meade, I said Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
She will not consider it, sir.
Oh, yes, I will!
Choose your partners for the Virginia reel!
We've shocked the Confederacy.
It's like blockade running, isn't it?
It's worse.
I expect a very fancy profit out of it.
I don't care what you expect.
I'm gonna dance and dance!
Tonight I wouldn't mind dancing with Abe Lincoln himself!
Another dance and my reputation will be lost forever.
With enough courage you can do without a reputation.
Oh, you do talk scandalous!
You do waltz divinely, Captain Butler.
Don't start flirting with me. I'm not one of your plantation beaus.
I want more than flirting from you.
What do you want?
I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara, if you'll take that Southern belle simper off your face.
Someday I want you to say to me the words I heard you say to Ashley Wilkes.
"I love you."
That's something you'll never hear from me as long as you live.
How sweet. How kind.
He is a thoughtful gentleman.
Why doesn't he say something about my sacrifice?
Oh, the darling thing!
Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely!
You didn't really bring it all the way from Paris just for me.
Yes, I thought it was about time I got you out of that fake mourning.
Next trip I'll bring you some green silk for a frock to match it.
- Oh, Rhett.
- It's my duty to our.. ..brave boys at the front to keep our girls at home looking pretty.
It's so long since I had anything new!
How do I look?
Awful!
Just awful!
What's the matter?
This war's stopped being a joke when a girl doesn't know the latest fashion.
Oh, Rhett!
But, Rhett, I don't know how I'd dare wear it!
You will, though.
And another thing, those pantalets!
I don't know a woman in Paris who wears pantalets anymore.
What do they..?
You shouldn't talk about such things.
You don't mind my knowing about them, just my talking about them.
I can't go on accepting these gifts, though you're awfully kind.
I'm not kind. I'm tempting you.
I never give without expecting something in return. I always get paid.
I won't marry you to pay for the bonnet.
Don't flatter yourself. I'm not a marrying man.
Well, I won't kiss you for it either.
Open your eyes and look at me.
No, I don't think I will kiss you.
Although you need kissing, badly.
That's what's wrong with you.
You should be kissed, and often. And by someone who knows how.
And I suppose you think you're the proper person!
I might be, if the right moment ever came.
You're a conceited, black-hearted varmint!
I don't know why I let you come and see me.
I'll tell you why, Scarlett.
I'm the only man over 16 and under 60 who's around to show you a good time.
But cheer up. The war can't last much longer.
Really, Rhett?
There's a battle going on now that ought to fix things..
- ..one way or the other.
- Oh, Rhett. Is Ashley in it?
So you haven't gotten the wooden-headed Mr. Wilkes out of your mind.
- Yes, I suppose he's in it.
- But tell me, where is it?
Some little town in Pennsylvania called Gettysburg.
Casualty lists! Casualty lists!
Here you is.
They was fighting for them so, it got tore in half.
Scarlett, you look. The W's at the end.
Wellman, Wendel, White, Whitman, Wilkens, Williams, Woolsey, Wortman..
Scarlett, you've passed him!
He isn't there!
He isn't there!
Ashley's safe, he isn't listed!
Oh, he's safe.
Scarlett, you're so sweet to worry about Ashley like this for me.
I must go to her.
Don't, my dear.
Let's go home.
Dr. Meade, not..?
Yes, our boy Darcy.
I was making these mittens for him.
He won't need them now.
Well, I'm gonna enlist.
I'll show them! I'll kill those Yankees!
You hush your mouth.
You think it'll help your mother to have you shot too?
It's a black day, Scarlett. Haven't had bad news, have you?
- Ashley's safe.
- I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.
There are so many others.
- Any of your friends?
- About every family in the county. - The Tarleton boys, both of them.
- Yes.
Look at them. All these poor tragic people.
The South's sinking to its knees. It'll never rise again.
The Cause.
The cause of living in the past is dying right in front of us.
I never heard you talk like that.
I'm angry.
Waste always makes me angry and that's what this is, sheer waste!
But don't you be downcast.
Ashley's still alive to come home to the women who love him.
Both of them.
You're here!
Oh, you're here! You're really here at last!
Oh, my dear, I've waited so long!
Melanie, my dear, my darling wife!
But we're forgetting Scarlett.
Scarlett, dear.
Why, is this any way to greet a returning warrior?
Ashley, I..
Merry Christmas, Ashley.
Come on, old gentleman, come on. We's ate all your wives.
We's ate all your little chicks.
You got nobody to worry your head about leaving.
Come on.
Now you just stand still so you.. ..can be Christmas for the white folks.
Now, hold on!
Hold on!
Don't go getting so uppity.
Even if you is the last chicken in Atlanta.
Let's not talk about the war.
Let's talk Twelve Oaks and Tara and times before there was a war.
Could we have the wine?
Why did you say there wasn't enough?
There's plenty. It's the very last of my father's fine Madeira.
He got it from his uncle Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah..
..who married his cousin Jessica Carroll of Carrolton..
..who was his second cousin and akin to the Wilkeses too.
I saved it to wish Ashley a merry Christmas.
But you mustn't drink it all at once, because it is the last.
I meant it, my dear. It was a lovely Christmas gift.
Only generals have tunics like this.
I'm so happy you like it.
Where did you get the cloth?
It was sent by a Charleston lady.
I nursed her son while he was in the hospital before he died and..
You will take good care of it, won't you?
You won't let it get torn.
Promise me.
You mustn't worry.
I'll bring it back to you without any holes in it.
- Good night, my dear.
Uncle Peter, is it time for Mr. Ashley to leave?
Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.
Melanie isn't going to the depot?
She hasn't changed her mind?
No, ma'am, she's laying down.
She's so upset, Mr. Wilkes told her she can't even come downstairs.
Ashley..
Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.
Scarlett, I'd rather remember you as you are now.
Not shivering at the depot.
All right.
Ashley, I've got a present for you too!
Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful!
Tie it on me, my dear.
While Melly was making a new tunic, I made this to go with it.
You made it yourself?
Well, then I shall value it all the more.
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you.
There's something you can do for me.
What is it?
Will you look after Melanie for me?
She's so frail and gentle, and she loves you so much.
- If I were killed..
- You mustn't say that! It's bad luck. Say a prayer, quickly.
You say one for me.
We shall need all our prayers. Now the end is coming.
- The end?
- The end of the war..
..and the end of our world, Scarlett.
But you don't think the Yankees are beating us?
Oh, Scarlett, my men are barefooted now!
And the snow in Virginia's deep.
When I see them, and I see the Yankees coming and coming..
..always more and more!
When the end does come, I shall be far away.
It'll be a comfort to me to know that she has you.
You will promise, won't you?
Yes.
Is that all, Ashley?
All except.. goodbye.
Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go!
- You must be brave.
You must! - No, no!
How else can I bear going?
Oh, Scarlett! You're so fine and strong and beautiful.
Not just your sweet face, my dear..
..but you.
Ashley, kiss me.
Kiss me goodbye.
- No, Scarlett. No!
- Oh, Ashley, I love you.
I've always loved you. I've never loved anyone else.
I only married Charles just to hurt you.
Ashley, tell me you love me.
I'll live on it the rest of my life!
Goodbye.
When the war's over, Ashley.
When the war's over.
And there's a place back home..
..where a wild plum tree comes to flower in the springtime..
..down by the creek, you know.
Yes, I know, I know.
When we were little, my brother Jeff and I used to..
I told you about my brother Jeff, didn't I, ma'am?
I know I did.
He..
We don't know where Jeff is now, ma'am.
Since Bull Run, we haven't heard anything and..
Please, we must have your temperature now.
Just take this in your mouth and not talk anymore.
Not just now.
Melanie, I'm so tired. I've got to go home.
Aren't you tired, Melanie?
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
This might be Ashley..
..and only strangers here to comfort him.
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
They could all be..
..Ashley.
I've been waiting one solid hour to speak to you, Mrs. Wilkes.
Go on, you trash. Don't you be pestering these ladies.
- Don't talk to her.
- It's all right. Who are you?
My name's Belle Watling. But that don't matter.
You think I got no business here.
Tell me what you want to see me about.
First time I come here, I says, "Belle, you're a nurse."
They didn't want my kind of nursing.
They was more than likely right.
Then I tried giving them money.
My money wasn't good enough either!
The old peahens!
I know a gentleman who says you're a human being.
If you are, which they ain't, you'll take my money for the hospital.
What are you doing here?
Haven't you been told twice already?
This time I'm conversing with Mrs. Wilkes!
You might as well take my money.
It's good money, even if it is mine.
- I'm sure you're very generous.
- I'm a Confederate, like everybody else.
Of course you are!
Some folks here wouldn't feel that way.
But maybe they ain't as good Christians as you.
Look, Mrs. Meade, it's a great deal of money.
Ten, 20, 30, 50!
And it's not our paper money, it's gold!
Let me see that handkerchief.
R.B.!
And she's driving away in Rhett Butler's carriage!
Oh, if I just wasn't a lady, what wouldn't I tell that varmint!
"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."
"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures."
"He restoreth my soul."
"He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake."
"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.."
"..
I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me."
"Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me."
The Yankees!
Yankees!
Oh, Dr. Meade, they're getting closer.
They'll never get into Atlanta. Never get through old Peg Leg Hood.
Give me something for the pain!
Give me something for the pain!
Sorry, son, we haven't got anything to give you.
These animals is driving me crazy!
What luck! You got my jack.
Give me an ace and I'll start another war.
And I'll bid the moon.
..that I never see you and my Pa again.
This leg's got to come off.
No, don't!
Leave me alone!
I'm sorry, soldier.
- We're all out of chloroform.
- We'll operate without it.
No, no, you won't!
You can't do it.
I won't let you do it!
Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off. It's gangrene.
No!
Oh!
I haven't seen my family in three days.
I'm going home for half an hour.
Orderly, give me a lift!
Nurse, you can free this bed.
Miss Scarlett!
Why, Frank Kennedy.
Miss Suellen. Is she well?
When did they bring you in?
Are you bad hurt?
- Suellen. Is she..?
- She's all right.
Dr. Wilson needs you in the operating room.
He's gonna take off that leg. Better hurry.
I'll be back.
No!
You leave me alone!
Don't! I can't stand it!
No, don't!
Don't cut!
Don't cut!
Don't!
Don't!
Please!
Where's the nurse?
Dr. Wilson's waiting.
Let him wait!
I'm going home! I've done enough!
I don't want any more men dying and screaming.
Big Sam!
Big Sam!
Big Sam!
Almighty Moses!
It's Miss Scarlett!
Big Sam!
Big Sam.
Sam, Elijah, Prophet, Apostle. I'm so glad to see you.
Tell me about Tara, about my mother. She didn't write me.
- She gone got sick. - Sick?
Just a little bit sick, that's all.
Your pa went wild when they wouldn't let him fight.
He had fits when they took us to dig the ditch for the soldiers.
Your ma said the Confederacy needs it.
We's digging for the South.
- Was there a doctor?
- We've got to march.
Don't worry, we'll stop them Yankees.
Goodbye, Big Sam. Goodbye, boys. If you get sick or hurt, let me know.
- Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Scarlett!
Scarlett!
Whoa. Climb into this buggy. This is no day for walking.
You'll get run over!
Oh, Rhett.
Drive me to Aunt Pitty's, please.
Panic's a pretty sight, isn't it?
Just another of Sherman's calling cards.
He'll pay us a visit soon.
I gotta get out of here before the Yankees come!
Leave your work at the hospital?
Or have you had enough of death and lice and men chopped up?
I suppose you weren't meant for sick men.
Don't talk like that. I'm so scared!
I wish I could get out of here.
Let's get out together.
No use letting the South come down around your ears.
There are too many nice places to go and visit.
- Mexico, London, Paris..
- With you?
Yes, ma'am.
With a man who understands and admires you for what you are.
I figure we belong together, being the same sort.
I've been waiting for you to grow up and get Ashley out of your heart.
Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to have a baby in another month or so.
It'll be hard loving a man with a wife and baby clinging to him.
Well, here we are. Are you going with me or are you getting out?
I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler. I'll hate and despise you till I die!
Oh, no, you won't, Scarlett.
Miss Scarlett!
Miss Scarlett!
Folks is all going to Macon, and folks is running away!
I can't bear those cannonballs right in my ears!
I faint every time I hear one.
Uncle Peter, look out for that trunk.
- You aren't leaving?
- I may be a coward.. ..but oh, dear!
Yankees in Georgia!
How did they ever get in?
I'm going too. Prissy, go pack my things.
Wait, I won't be a minute.
- Do you really think you ought to?
- Scarlett!
What is this?
You ain't planning on running away?
Don't try to stop me. I'm never going back to that hospital.
I've had enough of smelling death, of rot and death.
I'm going home! I want my mother. My mother needs me.
Listen to me! You must stay here.
Without a chaperon?
It simply isn't..
Good heavens, this is war, not a garden party!
- Melanie needs you.
- Oh, bother Melanie!
She's ill already. She shouldn't even be having a baby.
Can't we take her along?
Want her to be jounced over rough roads and have the baby ahead of time?
It isn't my baby.
You take care of her!
We haven't enough doctors to look after a sick woman.
You've got to stay.
What for?
I don't know anything about babies being born.
I knows!
I knows!
I knows how to do it. I's done it lots and lots.
Let me, doctor. Let me. - I can do everything.
- Good. I'll rely on you to help us.
Ashley's fighting in the field. Fighting for the Cause.
He may never come back. He may die.
Scarlett, we owe him a well-born child.
Ashley.
If you're coming, Scarlett, hurry!
I promised Ashley something..
Then you'll stay?
Good. Go along, Miss Pittypat. Scarlett's staying.
Go on, Uncle Peter.
I don't know what to do.
It's like the end of the world!
Uncle Peter, my smelling salt!
Melanie, Melanie! It's all your fault!
I hate you!
I hate you!
And I hate your baby!
If only I hadn't promised Ashley.
If only I hadn't promised him!
Stop!
Stop! Stop! Please, stop.
Are the Yankees coming?
The army's pulling out.
Pulling out and leaving us to the Yankees?
Not leaving, evacuating.
Before Sherman cuts the McDonough road.
It can't be true!
What'll I do?
Better refugee south, right quick.
Prissy!
Prissy!
Go pack my things and Melanie's too. We're going to Tara.
The Yankees are coming!
Scarlett!
Scarlett!
Melly, we're going to..
Melly..
I'm sorry to be such a bother, Scarlett.
It began at daybreak.
But..
But..
But the Yankees are coming.
Poor Scarlett.
You'd be at Tara now with your mother, wouldn't you?
If it weren't for me.
Oh, Scarlett, darling.
You've been so good to me.
No sister could have been sweeter.
I've been lying here thinking..
..if I should die..
..will you take my baby?
Fiddle-dee-dee, Melly.
Aren't things bad enough without you talking about dying?
- I'll send for Dr. Meade.
- Not yet, Scarlett.
I couldn't let Dr. Meade sit here for hours..
..while all those poor, wounded boys..
Prissy!
Prissy, Prissy!
Come here, quick!
Go get Dr. Meade.
Run! Quick! The baby.
Don't stand there like a scared goat. Run!
Hurry, hurry!
I'll sell you south, I will.
I swear I will!
Where's that Prissy?
This room's like an oven already and it isn't noon yet.
Don't worry, Melly.
Mother says it always seems like the doctor will never come.
If I don't take a strap to that Prissy!
Oh, Melly..
Know what I heard about Maybelle Merriwether?
You remember that funny-looking beau of hers?
The one with the uniform like ladies' red flannels?
You don't have to keep on talking for my sake.
I know how worried you are.
Oh, Melly.. I'll just go and fetch you some cooler water.
You're slow as molasses in January.
Where's Dr. Meade?
- I never seen him, Miss Scarlett. - What?
He ain't at the hospital.
A man told me that the doctor's down at the car shed.. ..with the wounded soldiers..
Well, why didn't you go after him?
Miss Scarlett, I's scared to go down there at the car shed.
There's folks dying down there. And I's scared of dead folks!
Go sit by Miss Melly.
And don't you be upsetting her or I'll whip the hide off you.
- Have you seen..?
- Move aside, lady, please.
Dr. Meade?
Dr. Meade. Dr. Meade, at last!
Thank heaven you're here. I need every pair of hands.
Now, come, child, wake up.
We got work to do.
But Melly's having her baby. You've got to come with me!
Are you crazy?
I can't leave these men for a baby.
They're dying!
Hundreds! Get a woman to help.
But there isn't anybody. Dr. Meade, she might die. Die?
Look at them, bleeding to death in front of my eyes!
No chloroform. No bandages. Nothing!
Run along and don't bother me.
Don't worry, child. There's nothing to bringing a baby.
- Bring the stretchers in here.
- Dr. Meade?
Yeah, I'm coming.
Is the doctor come?
No, he can't come.
Oh, Miss Scarlett, Miss Melly bad off.
He can't come. There's nobody to come.
You've got to manage without the doctor. I'll help you.
Oh, Lordy, Miss Scarlett!
Well, what is it?
Lordy, we's got to have a doctor!
I don't know nothing about birthing babies!
- What do you mean?
- I don't know..
You told me you knew everything!
I don't know why I lied!
Ma ain't never let me around when folks was having them.
Scarlett!
Scarlett!
Miss Scarlett!
Stop it!
Go light a fire on the stove.
Boil water in the kettle.
Get me a ball of twine, clean towels and the scissors.
Don't tell me you can't find them!
Go get them and get them quick!
Scarlett! Scarlett!
- Scarlett!
- Coming, Melly.
Coming!
You better go before the Yankees get here.
You know I won't leave you. It's no use.
I'm gonna die.
Don't be a goose, Melly. Hold on to me.
- Hold on to me!
- Talk to me, Scarlett. Please, talk to me.
Don't try to be brave.
Yell! There's nobody to hear.
Ma says if you puts a knife under the bed, it cuts the pain.
Captain Butler!
Captain Butler! Captain Butler!
- Who do you want?
- Captain Butler.
He's upstairs. Belle Watling's giving a party. Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Captain Butler!
Oh, Captain Butler!
What's all the rumpus about?
I's got a message for Captain Butler, Mrs. Watling.
Captain Butler, you come out here in the streets to me!
- What is it, Prissy?
- Miss Scarlett done sent me for you.
Miss Melly, she done had her baby today.
A fine baby boy.
And Miss Scarlett and me, we brung it.
Are you telling me Scarlett..?
It was mostly me, Captain Butler. Only Miss Scarlett, she helped me a little.
But I don't expect no doctor could have done no better.
Only, Miss Melly, she feel kind of poorly now it's all over.
Yes, I can believe that.
And the Yankees is coming. And Miss Scarlett, she says..
Captain Butler, the Yankees is here!
Please come and bring your carriage for us right away!
I'm sorry, but the army took my horse and carriage.
You better come upstairs. I'll see what I can do.
Oh, no, Captain Butler.
Ma would wear me out with a cornstalk if I was to go into Mrs. Watling's.
Any of you beauties know where I can steal a horse for a good cause?
Whoa!
- Is that you, Rhett?
- We's here, Miss Scarlett!
I knew you'd come.
Nice weather we're having.
Prissy tells me you're..
If you make any jokes now, I'll kill you!
- Don't tell me you're frightened?
- I'm scared to death! If you had sense, you'd be scared too.
- Oh, the Yankees!
- No, not yet.
That's what's left of our army blowing up the ammunition.
We gotta get out of here!
At your service. Where are you going?
- Home, to Tara.
- They've been fighting around Tara.
You're going to parade through there with a sick woman, a baby and a darkie?
Do you intend leaving them?
They're going with me, and you can't stop me!
It's dangerous jouncing Mrs. Wilkes over open country.
I want my mother!
I want to go home to Tara!
Tara's probably been burned.
The woods are full of stragglers.
The least they'll do is take the horse.
It's not much, but I had trouble stealing it.
I'm going home if I have to walk every step of the way!
I'll kill you if you try to stop me! I will, I will!
I will, I will!
All right, darling, all right. Now you shall go home.
I guess anybody who did what you've done today can take care of Sherman.
Stop crying.
Now blow your nose like a good little girl.
- What're you doing?
- I'm packing!
Well, stop it and come and get the baby!
Melly? - Melly?
- Mrs. Wilkes? - We're taking you to Tara.
- Tara?
It's the only way, Melly.
They'll burn the house over our heads if we stay.
It's all right, Melly.
My baby.
My poor baby.
- Can you put your arms around my neck?
Never mind.
Ashley, Charles!
What's she want?
Ashley's picture and Charles' sword.
Get them.
What's that?
Our gallant lads set fire to the warehouses.
Enough ammunition in boxcars to blow us to Tara.
- We have to get across the tracks.
- Not that way!
We have to.
McDonough road's the only one the Yankees haven't cut yet.
Wait, I forgot to lock the front door!
- What are you laughing at?
- At you, locking the Yankees out.
Oh, dear!
I wish they'd hurry.
I wouldn't be in such a hurry to see them go.
With them goes the last semblance of law and order.
Scavengers aren't wasting any time.
Better get out of here fast.
There's a horse!
Give us that horse!
Down the alley! Cut him off!
Give me that horse!
Oh, Miss Scarlett!
Haven't left much to take.
We'll make a dash for it before the fire reaches that ammunition.
Come on!
Throw me your shawl.
You'll like it better if you don't see anything.
Take a good look, my dear.
It's a historic moment.
Tell your grandchildren how you watched the Old South disappear one night.
They were gonna lick the Yankees in a month.
The poor gallant fools.
They make me sick.
Getting us all into this by swaggering and boasting.
That's the way I felt once about their "swaggering and boasting."
I'm so glad you aren't with the army.
You can be proud. Proud that you've been smarter than all of them.
I'm not so proud.
Why did you stop?
This is the turn to Tara. Let the horse breathe a bit.
Mrs. Wilkes.
Miss Melly done fainted way back, Captain Butler.
She's better off.
She couldn't stand the pain if she were conscious.
Scarlett, are you still determined to do this crazy thing?
Oh, yes, yes. I know we can get through, Rhett.
Not we, my dear, you.
I'm leaving you here. You're what?
Rhett, where are you going?
- I'm going to join the army. - You're joking.
- I could kill you for scaring me so.
- I'm very serious, Scarlett.
I'm going to join up with our brave lads in gray.
But they're running away.
They'll turn and make a last stand.
When they do, I'll be with them. - I'm a little late, but better late..
- You must be joking!
Selfish to the end, aren't you?
Thinking of your own hide, never a thought for the Cause.
How could you do this to me?
And why should you go now that it's all over, and I need you?
- Why?
Why?
- Why?
I've always had a weakness for lost causes, once they're really lost.
Or maybe..
Maybe I'm ashamed of myself.
Who knows?
You should die of shame to leave me alone and helpless!
You? Helpless?
Heaven help the Yankees if they capture you.
Now climb down here. - I want to say goodbye.
- No!
Climb down!
Rhett, please don't go! You can't leave me, please.
I'll never forgive you!
I'm not asking you to forgive me. I'll never forgive myself.
If a bullet gets me, I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot.
There's one thing I do know, and that is I love you, Scarlett.
In spite of you and me and the world going to pieces, I love you.
Because we're alike. Bad lots, both of us.
Selfish and shrewd, but able to look things in the eye and call them by name.
Don't hold me like that!
Scarlett.. Look at me.
I love you more than I've ever loved any woman.
And I've waited longer for you than any woman.
Let me alone!
A soldier of the South loves you.
Wants your arms around him.
Wants to carry the memory of your kisses into battle.
Never mind about loving me.
You're a woman sending a soldier to his death with a beautiful memory.
Scarlett, kiss me.
Kiss me once.
You low-down, cowardly, nasty thing, you!
They were right.
Everybody was right. You aren't a gentleman.
A minor point at such a moment.
Here.
If anyone lays a hand on that nag, shoot him.
But don't make a mistake and shoot the nag.
Go on!
I want you to go. I hope a cannonball blows you into a million pieces..!
Never mind the rest.
I follow your general idea.
And when I'm dead on the altar of my country, I hope your conscience irks you.
Goodbye, Scarlett.
Come on, you.
We're going home.
Oh, my poor baby.
Don't worry.
Mother will take care of him when we get home.
Miss Scarlett, I's powerful hungry.
- We's got to have something to eat.
We're nearly at Twelve Oaks. We'll stop there.
Go on!
Oh, Ashley. Ashley, I'm glad you're not here to see this.
The Yankees.
The dirty Yankees!
Prissy! Come tie up this cow.
We don't need no cow, Miss Scarlett.
We'll be home soon, and I's scared of cows.
Tie her onto the back of the wagon with your petticoat.
We need milk for the baby, and we don't know what we'll find at home.
Melly, we're home!
We're at Tara.
Hurry!
Move, you brute!
Miss Scarlett, it's dead!
I can't see the house.
Is it there?
I can't see the house.
Have they burned it?
It's all right! It's all right!
They haven't burned it.
It's still there!
Mother!
Mother, I'm home!
Mother!
Mother, I'm home!
Mother, let me in.
It's me.
Oh, Pa!
I'm home.
I'm home.
Katie?
Katie Scarlett!
Oh, darlin'!
Mammy!
Mammy, I'm home.
Honey child..
Mammy, I'm so..
Where's Mother?
Why..
..Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen, they was sick with the typhoid.
They had it bad, but they's doing all right now.
- Just weak, like little kittens.
- But where's Mother?
Well..
Miss Ellen. She went down to nurse that Emmie Slattery..
..that white trash, and she took down with it too.
Then last night, she..
Mother?
Mother?
Mother?
Mother?
Miss Scarlett, honey.
If there's anything I can do, Miss Scarlett..
- What did you do with Melly?
- Don't worry your pretty head.
I done slapped her in bed, along with the baby.
You better put that cow into the barn.
There ain't no barn no more.
- Yankees burned it for firewood.
- This was their headquarters.
They camped all around.
Yankees in Tara?
Yes'm, and they stole most everything they didn't burn.
All the clothes and all the rugs, and even Miss Ellen's rosaries.
I'm starving. Get me something to eat.
There ain't nothing to eat, honey. They took it all.
All the chickens?
Everything?
They took them first.
What they didn't eat, they carried off.
Don't tell me any more about what "they" did!
What's this, Pa?
- Whiskey?
- Yes, daughter.
Katie Scarlett, that's enough.
Your not knowing spirits, you'll make yourself tipsy.
I hope it makes me drunk.
I'd like to be drunk.
Oh, Pa..
What are those papers?
Bonds.
They're all we've saved, all we have left.
Bonds.
But what kind of bonds, Pa?
Why, Confederate bonds, of course.
Confederate bonds.
What good are they to anybody?
I'll not have you talking like that.
Oh, Pa, what are we going to do with no money.. ..and nothing to eat?
We must ask your mother.
That's it.
We must ask Mrs. O'Hara.
- Ask Mother?
- Yes.
Mrs. O'Hara will know what's to be done.
Now don't be bothering me.
Go out for a ride.
I'm busy.
Oh, Pa..
Don't worry about anything.
Katie Scarlett's home.
You needn't worry.
What'll we do with nothing to feed those sick folks and that child?
I don't know, Mammy.
I don't know.
We ain't got nothing but radishes in the garden.
Miss Scarlett, Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen..
..they's fussing to be sponged off.
- Where are the other servants?
- Only just me and Pork left.
The others went to war or runned away.
I can't take care of that baby and sick folkses too!
I's only got two hands.
Who's gonna milk that cow, Miss Scarlett?
As God is my witness..
As God is my witness, they're not going to lick me.
I'm going to live through this, and when it's all over.. ..I'll never be hungry again.
No, nor any of my folk.
If I have to lie, steal, cheat, or kill..
..as God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again!
My back's near broken.
Look at my hands!
Mother said you could always tell a lady by her hands.
I guess things like hands and ladies don't matter so much anymore.
Rest, Sue. You're not well yet.
I can pick cotton for both of us.
Scarlett's hateful! Making us work in the fields..
Too bad about that. Get back to work.
I can't do everything at Tara myself.
What do I care about Tara? I hate Tara!
Don't you ever dare say you hate Tara again!
It's the same as hating Pa and Ma.
There's something I must speak to you about.
What is it?
I don't like the way you're treating Prissy and Mammy.
You must be firm with inferiors, but gentle with them.
Especially darkies.
I know.
But I'm not asking them to do what I don't do myself.
Nevertheless, I don't like it.
I shall speak to Mrs. O'Hara about it.
- What are you doing out of bed?
- I must talk to you. You're all working so hard. I can't just lie in bed.
Go upstairs. You're as weak as a newborn colt.
- Please, let me.
- Stop being noble.
I don't need you making yourself sick so you'll never be any use.
Oh, I didn't think of it that way.
Who's there?
Halt or I'll shoot!
You all alone, little lady?
You ain't very friendly, are you?
You got anything else besides these earbobs?
You Yankees have been here before.
Regular little spitfire, ain't you?
What do you got hidden in your hand?
Scarlett, you killed him.
I'm glad you killed him.
Scarlett, what happened?
What is it, Scarlett? What is it?
Don't be scared!
Your sister was cleaning a revolver and it went off and scared her.
- Thank goodness! - We got enough to frighten us.
Tell Katie Scarlett she must be more careful.
What a cool liar you are, Melly.
We gotta get him out of here and bury him.
If the Yankees find him here..
I didn't see anyone else. I think he must be a deserter.
Even so, we've gotta hide him.
They might hear about it, and then they'd come and get you.
I could bury him in the arbor where the ground is soft..
..but how will I get him out of here?
- We'll both take a leg and drag him.
- You couldn't drag a cat.
Scarlett.. Would it be dishonest if we went through his haversack?
I'm ashamed I didn't think of that myself.
You take the haversack. I'll search his pockets.
You look.
I'm feeling a little weak.
I think it's full of money.
Melly, look. Just look!
Ten, 20, 30..
Don't stop to count it now. We haven't got time!
Do you realize this means we can eat?
Look in his other pockets.
Hurry, hurry!
We've got to get him out of here.
If he bleeds across the yard, we can't hide it.
Give me your nightgown.
I'll wad it round his head.
Don't be silly, I won't look at you.
If I had on pantalets, I'd use them.
Thank heavens I'm not that modest.
Now go back to bed. You'll be dead if you don't.
I'll clean up my mess when I've buried him.
No, I'll clean it up.
Well, I guess I've done murder.
I won't think about that now.
I'll think about that tomorrow.
Katie Scarlett!
It's over! It's over!
It's all over, the war.
Lee surrendered!
- It's not possible.
- Why did we ever fight?
Ashley will be coming home.
Yes, Ashley will be coming home.
We'll plant more cotton.
Cotton ought to go sky-high next year.
The flag that makes you free
So we sing the chorus From Atlanta to the sea
While we were marching through Georgia
Get out of the road, rebel!
Have you room for a dying man?
Not for any Southern scum, alive or dead.
Get out of the way!
I reckon he'd rather try and walk it, at that.
Jump, you gray-backed beggars!
Acts like they won the war.
You come on, give me them pants, Mr. Kennedy.
Come on!
Scrub yourself with that lye soap, 'fore I scrub you myself.
I'm gonna put these britches in the boiling pot.
The whole army's got the same troubles.. ..crawling clothes and dysentery.
It's humiliating how you're treating him.
You'd be a sight more humiliated if Mr. Kennedy's lice gets on you.
Oh, come on, Beau!
We must leave this gentleman alone because he's tired and he's hungry.
I don't mind, ma'am. Good to see a youngster again.
Nice little fella.
Another two years, and we could've had him in Cobb's Legion.
- Were you in Cobb's Legion?
- Yes, ma'am.
Why, then, you must know my husband, Major Wilkes?
Oh, yes, ma'am.
He was captured at Spotsylvania, I think.
Captured?
Oh, thank heaven! Then he isn't..
- My poor Ashley, in a Yankee prison.
- Melanie?
Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming.
Come along, Beau.
I'll watch out for him. We're good friends.
Thank you.
I slave day and night just so we can have enough food..
..and you give it away to scarecrows.
- I'd sooner have a plague of locusts.
- Don't scold me, Scarlett.
I've just heard that Ashley was taken prisoner.
- Ashley a prisoner?
- Yes.
And maybe if he's alive and well, he's on some Northern road right now.
Maybe a Northern woman is giving him some of her dinner..
..and helping my beloved to come back home to me.
- I hope so, Melly.
- Miss Scarlett?
I want to take up something with your Pa, but he doesn't seem to..
Perhaps I can help you. I'm head of the house now.
Well, I..
I.. Miss Scarlett, I was aiming to ask for Suellen.
Are you telling me you haven't asked for her after all these years?
The truth is, I'm so much older than she is..
..and now I haven't a cent to my name.
Who has, nowadays?
Miss Scarlett, if true love carries any weight with you..
..you can be sure your sister will be rich in that.
I'd go and get myself a little business, if we're engaged.
- As soon as I'm on my feet again..
- All right, Frank. I'm sure I can speak for Pa.
You go ask her now.
Thank you. Thank you, Miss Scarlett.
Excuse me, Mrs. Wilkes.
Excuse me.
What seems to be the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?
More trouble than he guesses.
He's finally asked for Suellen's hand.
Oh, I'm so glad. It's a pity he can't marry her now.
It'd be one less mouth to feed.
Oh, another one!
- Hope this one isn't hungry.
- He'll be hungry.
I'll tell Prissy to get an extra plate..
Ashley!
Ashley!
Miss Scarlett!
Don't spoil it.
Turn me loose, you fool. Turn me loose! It's Ashley!
He's her husband, ain't he?
- Miss Scarlett?
- High time you got back.
- Did you get the horse shod?
- Yes'm, he's shod.
Fine thing, horses get shoes and humans can't.
Here, stir this soap.
Miss Scarlett, ma'am?
I gotta know how much money have you got left. In gold.
Ten dollars. Why?
That won't be enough.
What are you talking about?
Well, I see'd that old no-count white-trash Wilkerson..
..that used to be Mr. Gerald's overseer here. He's a regular Yankee now, and he was making a brag..
..that his Carpetbagger friends run the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.
- How much more we got to pay?
- I hear the taxman say $300.
Three hundred..!
It might just as well be 3 million.
But we gotta raise it, that's all.
Yes'm. How?
- I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.
- He ain't got no $300.
Well, I can ask him if I want to, can't I?
Asking ain't getting.
Ashley..
They say Abe Lincoln got his start splitting rails.
Just think what heights I may climb to, once I get the knack.
Ashley, the Yankees want $300 more in taxes.
What shall we do?
Ashley, what's to become of us?
What becomes of people when their civilization breaks up?
Those with brains and courage come through all right.
Those that haven't are winnowed out.
For heaven's sake..
..don't talk nonsense when it's us being winnowed out!
You're right, Scarlett.
Here I am talking tommyrot about civilization..
..while your Tara is in danger.
You've come to me for help, and I've none to give.
Oh, Scarlett, I'm a coward.
You, Ashley?
A coward?
What are you afraid of?
Mostly of life becoming too real for me, I suppose.
Not that I mind splitting rails.
But I do mind very much losing the beauty of that life I loved.
If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.
But the war did come.
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.
I saw men crumple up in agony when I shot them.
And now I find myself in a world which for me is worse than death.
A world in which there's no place for me.
I can't make you understand.
You don't know the meaning of fear.
You never mind facing realities.
You never want to escape from them as I do.
Escape?
Ashley, you're wrong.
I do want to escape too.
I'm so very tired of it all.
I've struggled for food and for money. I've weeded, hoed and picked cotton till I can't stand it.
I tell you, the South is dead. It's dead!
The Yankees and Carpetbaggers have it and left nothing for us.
Oh, Ashley.. Let's run away.
We'd go to Mexico.
They want officers in the Mexican army. We'd be happy.
I'd work for you. I'd do anything for you!
You don't love Melanie.
You said you loved me at Twelve Oaks.
And anyway, Melanie can't..
Dr. Meade said she can't have more children.
I could give you..
Can't we ever forget Twelve Oaks?
You think I could ever forget? Have you?
Can you honestly say you don't love me?
- No, I don't love you.
- It's a lie!
Even so, do you think I'd leave Melanie and the baby?
You couldn't leave your father and the girls.
I'm sick of them. I'm tired of them!
Yes, you're sick and tired. That's why you're talking this way.
You've carried the load for all of us.
From now on, I'll be more help to you. I promise.
There's only one way you can help me. Take me away.
There's nothing to keep us here.
Nothing?
Nothing except honor.
Please, Scarlett. Please, dear. You mustn't cry.
You mustn't. Please, my brave dear, you mustn't.
You do love me! You do love me!
- No, don't, don't.
- You love me.
We won't do this. I tell you, we won't do it!
It won't happen again.
I'll take Melanie and go.
- Say it. You love me.
- All right, I'll say it.
I love your courage and stubbornness so much that I could forget..
..the best wife a man ever had. But I'm not going to forget her!
Then there's nothing left for me.
Nothing to fight for.
Nothing to live for.
Yes, there is something.
Something you love better than me..
..though you may not know it.
Tara.
Yes.
I still have this.
You needn't go.
I won't have you all starve, simply because I threw myself at your head.
It won't happen again.
It's Emmie Slattery.
- Yes'm, it's me.
- Stop!
You haven't forgotten your old overseer, have you?
Emmie's Mrs. Wilkerson now.
Get off those steps, you wench!
Get off this land!
You can't speak that way to my wife.
Wife? High time you made her your wife.
Who baptized your brats after you killed my mother?
We came out here to pay a call.
A friendly call, and talk business with old friends.
Friends? When were we ever friends?
Still high and mighty, ain't you?
Well, I know all about you.
Your father's turned idiot.
You can't pay your taxes, and I come to offer to buy the place from you.
To make you a right good offer.
Emmie wants to live here.
Get off this place, you dirty Yankee!
You'll see who's running things when you're sold out for taxes.
I'll buy this place and I'll live in it!
But I'll wait for the sheriff's sale.
That's all of Tara you'll ever get!
You'll be sorry for that.
We'll be back!
I'll show you who the owner of Tara is!
Pa, come back!
Pa, come back!
Yankee coward!
Pa!
Lordy, Miss Scarlett, that's Mr. Gerald's watch!
You take it. It's for you. Pa'd want you to have it.
You ain't got no business parting from this watch now.
You needs all your valuables to sell for that tax money.
Do you think I'd sell Pa's watch?
And don't cry. I can stand everybody's tears but yours.
Oh, Mammy, Mammy!
You've been brave so long. You just gotta go on being brave.
- Think about your Pa like he used to be.
- I can't think about Pa. I can't think of anything but that $300.
Ain't no good thinking about that. Ain't nobody got that much money.
Nobody but Yankees and Scalawags got that much money now.
Rhett.
Who that?
A Yankee?
Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale..
..and I haven't any clothes.
Go and get Ma's old box of dress patterns.
- What you up to?
- You'll make me a new dress.
Not with Miss Ellen's portières!
Great balls of fire! They're my portières now.
I'm going to Atlanta for $300, and I've got to look like a queen.
- Who's going with you?
- I'll go alone.
That's what you think! I's going with you and that new dress.
- Mammy, darling.
- No use to try to sweet talk me.
I knows you since I put diapers on you.
I said I's going with you, and going I is!
Kings in trade, eh? Too good for me, major.
It's a pity the war wasn't a poker game.
You'd done better than Grant, with far less effort.
What is it?
There's a lady to see Captain Butler. Says she's his sister.
Another sister?
This is a jail not a harem, captain.
No, she ain't one of those. She's got her mammy with her.
She has?
I'd like to see this one, major.
Without her mammy.
Let's see, my losses for the afternoon come to what?
Three hundred and forty?
My debts do mount up, don't they, major?
All right, corporal, show Captain Butler's "sister" to his cell.
Thank you, major.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
It's hard to be strict with a man who loses money so pleasantly.
- Rhett!
- Scarlett! My dear little sister!
It's all right, corporal.
My sister has brought me no files or saws.
Can I really kiss you?
On the forehead, like a good brother.
No, thanks. I'll wait and hope for better things.
I was so distressed when I heard you were in jail. I couldn't sleep for thinking.
It's not true they'll hang you?
Would you be sorry?
- Oh, Rhett.
- Well, don't worry yet. They trumped up a charge, but they really want my money.
They think I made off with the Confederate treasury.
- Well, did you?
- What a leading question.
Let's not talk about things like money.
How good of you to come and see me.
And how pretty you look!
How you do run on, teasing a country girl like me.
Thank heavens you're not in rags.
I'm tired of women in rags. Turn around.
You look good enough to eat, and prosperous.
I've been doing very well.
Everyone's well at Tara, only..
..I got so bored, I thought I'd treat myself to a visit to town.
You're heartless, but that's part of your charm.
You've got more charm than the law allows.
I didn't come to talk silliness about me.
I was so miserable at the thought of you in trouble.
I was mad at you when you left me on the road to Tara. - And I still haven't forgiven you.
- Don't say that.
Well, I must admit I might not be alive now, only for you.
When I think of myself with anything I could possibly hope for..
..not a care in the world, and you here in this horrid jail.
And not even a human jail, Rhett, a horse jail!
Listen to me trying to make jokes..
..when I really want to cry.
In a minute I shall cry.
Scarlett.. Can it be possible that..?
Can what be possible, Rhett?
That you've grown a woman's heart? A real woman's heart.
I have, Rhett.
I know I have.
It's worth being in jail just to hear you say that.
It's well worth it.
You can drop the moonlight and magnolia.
Things have been going well at Tara?
What've you done with your hands?
- I went riding without my gloves..
- You've been working like a field hand!
Why did you lie, and what are you up to?
- I almost believed you cared.
- But I do care!
Let's get down to the truth. You want something enough.. ..to put on quite a show in your velvets.
What is it?
Money?
I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.
I lied when I said everything was all right.
Things are as bad as they possibly could be.
And you've got millions.
What collateral do you have?
- My earbobs.
- Not interested.
- Mortgage on Tara.
- What would I do with a farm?
- I'd pay you out of next year's cotton.
- Not good enough.
You once said you loved me.
If you still love me..
You haven't forgotten, I'm not a marrying man.
No, I haven't forgotten.
You're not worth $300.
You'll never mean anything but misery to any man.
I don't care what you say, only give me the money.
I won't let Tara go! I can't while there's a breath left in my body.
Oh, Rhett, won't you please give me the money?
I couldn't if I wanted to.
My funds are in Liverpool, not Atlanta.
If I drew a draft, they'd be on me like a duck on a June bug.
So you see, my dear, you've abased yourself to no purpose.
Here, here. Stop it!
You want the Yankees to see you like this?
Take your hands off me, you skunk!
You knew what I wanted.
You knew you wouldn't lend me the money and you let me go on!
I enjoyed hearing what you had to say.
Cheer up.
Come to my hanging, I'll put you in my will.
I'll come to your hanging!
I'm just afraid they won't hang you in time to pay the taxes on Tara!
Tell him Belle Watling.
Where you been?
I thought you deserted Captain Butler.
I keep myself occupied.
Who that?
I ain't never see'd hair that color before in my life.
You know a dyed-haired woman?
Wish I knew that one.
She'd get my money for me.
Whatever they done to you in there..
..they didn't do no more than you deserve for visiting white trash.
- Fresh and green. - Right off the farm.
- What you doing tonight, Susie?
- That's a Georgia peach!
Nothing like that in Ohio.
You know what we'll do?
What?
We're gonna give every one of you 40 acres and a mule.
- And a mule?
- Forty acres and a mule!
- Because we're your friend.
And you're gonna become voters and vote like your friends do!
- What's your hurry?
- What's come over this town?
Yankees have come over it.
Same as they've come over all of them.
Out of our way, trash!
Get out of the way here!
It can't be Miss Scarlett!
- Frank Kennedy!
- And Mammy. It's good to see home folks.
- I didn't know you were here. - I didn't know you were.
Didn't Suellen tell you about my store?
Did she? I don't remember.
- This?
- Won't you come in, look around a bit?
I don't suppose it looks like much to a lady..
..but I can't help being proud of it.
- You're not making money?
- Well, I can't complain.
In fact, I'm mighty encouraged. Folks tell me I'm just a born merchant.
Won't be long before Miss Suellen and I can marry.
- Are you doing as well as all that?
- Yes, I am. I'm no millionaire yet..
..but I've cleared $1000 already.
And lumber too.
- That's only a sideline.
- A sideline, Frank?
With all the good Georgia pine around Atlanta, and all this building?
Well, all that takes money, Miss Scarlett..
..and I gotta think about buying a home.
Why would you want a home?
For Suellen to set up housekeeping.
Here in Atlanta. You'd want to bring her to Atlanta.
There wouldn't be much help in that for Tara.
I don't know what you mean.
I don't mean a thing.
How'd you like to drive me to my Aunt Pitty's?
Nothing'd give me more pleasure.
You better stay to supper.
Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable, and I'd like a long visit.
You act on me just like a tonic, Miss Scarlett.
And will you tell me all the news.. ..of Miss Suellen?
What's the matter?
Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?
Oh, no, no.
I thought surely she had written you.
I guess she was ashamed to write you. She should be ashamed.
How awful to have such a mean sister.
You must tell me. Don't leave me on tenterhooks.
Well, she's going to marry one of the county boys next month.
She got tired of waiting, was afraid she'd be an old maid and..
Oh, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.
It's cold, and I left my muff at home.
Would you mind if I put my hand in your pocket?
But, Melanie, you don't realize what she's done!
She's gone and married my Mr. Kennedy!
He's my beau and she's married him!
- She did it to save Tara.
- I hate Tara! I hate Scarlett! She's the only thing I hate worse than Tara!
It's all my fault.
I should've committed robbery to get that tax money for you.
I couldn't let you do anything like that.
Anyway, it's done now.
Yes, it's done now.
You won't let me do anything dishonorable..
..yet you'd sell yourself in marriage to a man you didn't love.
You won't have to worry about my helplessness anymore.
What do you mean?
I'm going to New York.
I've arranged for a position in a bank.
But you can't do that.
I counted on you to help me start a lumber business and..
I counted on you.
I don't know anything about the lumber business.
You know as much as you do about banking..
..and I'd give you half the business.
That's generous of you, Scarlett. But it isn't that.
If I go to Atlanta and take help from you again..
..I'd bury any hope of ever standing alone.
Oh, is that all?
You could gradually buy the business, and then it would be your own and..
No, Scarlett.
Oh! Ashley!
Ashley!
Scarlett?
Scarlett, what is it?
Ashley's so mean and hateful!
What have you done?
She wanted me to go to Atlanta.
To help me start my lumber business.
And he won't help me!
How unchivalrous of you. Why, think, Ashley, think!
If it hadn't been for Scarlett, I'd have died in Atlanta..
..and maybe we wouldn't have little Beau.
When I think of her picking cotton and plowing..
..just to keep food in our mouths, I could just..
Oh, my darling.
All right, Melanie.
I'll go to Atlanta.
I can't fight you both.
Come on, lift them feet!
There's your new mill hands, Mrs. Kennedy.
The pick of all the best jails in Georgia.
- They look thin and weak.
They're the best you can lease.
If you'll give Johnnie Gallegher a free hand.. ..you'll get what you want out of them.
All right, you're the foreman.
Just keep the mill running and deliver my lumber when I want it.
Johnnie Gallegher's your man, miss.
But remember.. ..no questions and no interference.
That's a bargain. Start in the morning.
Come on, get a move on there!
But this isn't right, and you know it. Bad enough to be a businesswoman..
Why do you complain?
You wouldn't own a mill if I didn't take over.
But I didn't want the mill.
We couldn't buy it if you hadn't pressed our friends for their debts.
Isn't that right, Ashley?
Are you running a charitable institution?
Go back to the store, and go home and take your medicine.
Sugar, don't you think..? Great balls of fire!
Don't bother me.
And don't call me "sugar."
All right.
All right.
Good night, Ashley.
My, my! She can get mad quicker than any woman I ever saw.
I don't like to interfere..
..but I wish you'd let me hire darkies and not use convicts.
We could do better.
Darkies' pay would break us. Convicts are cheap.
If we give Gallegher a free hand..
A free hand? That means he'll starve and whip them.
Didn't you see them? Some are sick.
How you do run on. If I let you alone, you'd give them chicken..
..and tuck them in with quilts.
I won't make money out of the enforced labor and misery of others.
You didn't mind owning slaves.
That was different. We didn't treat them that way.
I'd have freed them when father died..
..if the war hadn't already freed them.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.
Do you forget what it's like without money?
Money is the most important thing in the world.
I don't intend to be without it again.
I'll make enough the only way I know how so the Yankees can't take Tara.
We're not the only Southerners who've suffered.
Look at all our friends.
They're keeping their honor and kindness.
And they're starving.
I've no use for fools who won't help themselves.
I know what they say about me. I don't care.
I'll befriend Carpetbaggers and beat them at their own game.
And you'll beat them with me.
That's it. Pull it a little over to that side.
- Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.
- Good afternoon.
- Business is certainly growing.
- It certainly is.
You're doing business with the people..
..who robbed us, tortured us and left us to starve.
All that's past.
I intend to make the best of things, even if they are Yankee things.
And do you know that Dr. Meade actually saw her..
- ..peddling lumber to Yankees herself?
- That isn't all.
It's shocking what she's doing to my brother.
She's even taken to driving her own buggy.
My dear Mrs. Kennedy. My very dear Mrs. Kennedy!
I don't see how you have the gall to face me!
You could've had my millions if you'd just waited a while.
Oh, how fickle is woman!
What is it you want?
I have things to do.
Will you satisfy my curiosity on a point which has always bothered me?
Well, what is it?
Tell me, do you never shrink from marrying men you don't love?
How'd you get out of jail?
Why didn't they hang you?
Oh, that! There's nothing much that money won't buy.
I observe it's even bought you the honorable Mr. Wilkes.
So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.
I believe you're jealous of him.
You still think you're the belle of the county, the cutest trick in shoe leather.
- That every man is in love with you.
- Let me by.
Don't be angry. Tell me, where are you going?
- I'm going out to the mill.
- Through Shantytown alone? It's dangerous to drive alone through all that riffraff.
Don't worry about me.
I can shoot straight, if I don't have to shoot too far.
What a woman!
Give me a quarter.
Let go of my horse!
Hold this horse.
- Let go!
- Give me that gun.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Miss Scarlett!
Wait! Miss Scarlett, wait!
Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett! - It's Sam!
- Big Sam?
Miss Scarlett, wait!
Sam! Sam!
Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett? Did they hurt you?
Don't you cry.
Big Sam will get you out of this in a jiffy.
Horse, make tracks!
Get to Tara as quick as you can and stay there.
I will. I's had enough of them Carpetbaggers.
Thank you, Mr. Frank.
Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
Goodbye, Sam. Thank you.
Change your dress and go over to Miss Melly's.
I've got to go to a political meeting.
How can you go to a political meeting after what I've been through?
Oh, sugar. You're more scared than hurt.
Nobody cares about me.
You all act as though it were nothing at all.
The men talk about protecting our women..
..and then after what happened to me, Frank went to a political meeting.
And if it won't pain you too much, India Wilkes..
..tell me why you're staring at me.
Has my face gone green?
It won't pain me. What happened today was just what you deserved.
With any justice, you'd have gotten worse.
- India, hush up. - Let her talk.
She's always hated me.
Ever since I took Charles away, though she won't admit it.
If she thought anybody'd notice, she'd walk the street naked.
I do hate you!
You've done all you could to lower the prestige of decent people.
Now you've endangered the lives of our men..
..because they've got to..
India! We'd better not say any more, or one of us will be saying too much.
What's going on that I don't know about?
Somebody's coming up the walk.
Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.
Will you hand me the pistol, Mrs. Meade?
Whoever it is..
..we know nothing.
Where have they gone?
Tell me. It's life or death.
Don't tell him. He's a Yankee spy.
Quickly. There may be time.
- How'd you know?
- I played poker with Yankees.
They knew there'd be trouble. They sent the cavalry out.
Your men are walking into a trap.
Don't tell him. He's trying to trap you.
Out the Decatur road. The old Sullivan plantation. They're meeting in the cellar.
I'll do what I can.
What's this about?
If you don't tell me, I'll go crazy.
We thought it best not to tell you.
The men have gone to clean out the woods where you were attacked.
It's what many of our Southern men have had to do to protect us.
And if they're captured, they'll be hanged.
And it will be your fault.
Another word and you leave, India.
Scarlett did what she had to do.
Our men are doing what they think they have to do.
Frank.. ..and Ashley.
Oh, it isn't possible.
There's horses, Miss Melly.
Here they come.
We're sewing, we're sewing!
Open the door.
Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.
Who is Mrs. Wilkes?
I am Mrs. Wilkes.
- I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes.
- He's not here.
- Are you sure?
- Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word!
I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.
If you give me your word, I won't search the house.
Mr. Wilkes is at a political meeting at Mr. Kennedy's store.
He's not at the store. There's no meeting tonight, no political meeting.
We'll wait outside till he and his friends return.
Surround the house. Put a man on each door and window.
Keep on with your sewing, ladies.
And I'll read aloud.
"The Personal History and Experience of David Copperfield."
"Chapter One." "I am born."
"To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born.."
"Chapter Nine. I have a memorable birthday."
"I pass over all that happened at school.."
"..until the anniversary of my birthday came round in March."
"Except that Steerforth was more to be admired than ever, I remember nothing."
"He was going away at the end of the half-year.."
"..if not sooner, and was more spirited and independent than before."
"But beyond this, I remember nothing."
"I remember nothing."
Melly, they're drunk!
Leave this to me, Scarlett.
And, please, say nothing.
- You stupid fool!
Will you shut up, for the love of..
Hello, Melly.
So you've got my husband intoxicated again.
Well, bring him in.
I'm sorry, your husband's under arrest.
If you arrest all the drunks in Atlanta, you must arrest a good many Yankees.
Bring him in, Captain Butler, if you can walk yourself.
- Wait.
- I wanna tell you a story.
Listen, doctor, I..
Put him down in that chair.
Now, captain, please leave my house..
..and try to remember not to come here again.
That's fine thanks I get for bringing him home.. ..and not leaving him in this shameful condition.
Now, boys, all together..
Dr. Meade! I'm astonished at you!
Oh, Ashley! How can you do this to me?
I ain't so very drunk, Melly.
Take him to the bedroom. Lay him out on the bed.
- Don't touch him.
He's under arrest. - Now, Tom. What do you want to arrest him for?
I've seen him drunker.
I've seen you drunker. And you've seen me..
He can lie in the gutter for all I care. I'm not a policeman.
He led a raid on that Shantytown where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble.
A lot of shanties were burned. A couple of men were killed.
It's time you rebels learned you can't take the law into your own hands.
What are you laughing at?
This isn't your night to teach that lesson.
These two have been with me tonight. Yes, sir.
With you, Rhett?
Where?
I don't like to say in the presence of ladies.
You'd better say.
Come out on the porch and I'll tell you.
Speak out. I think I have a right to know where my husband's been.
Well, ma'am.. ..we dropped in on a friend of mine..
..and the captain's.
A Mrs. Belle Watling.
We played cards and drank champagne, and, well..
Now you've done it. Did you have to show me up in front of my wife?
Now, I hope you're satisfied.
These ladies won't be speaking with their husbands.
Well, Rhett, I had no idea.
Look here, will you take an oath that they were with you tonight at Belle's?
Ask Belle if you don't believe me.
She'll tell you.
Will you give me your word, as a gentleman?
As a gentleman?
Why, certainly, Tom.
Well, if I've made a mistake, I'm sorry.
I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes.
If you'll leave us in peace.
Well, I say I'm sorry.
Well, I am sorry.
Come on, sergeant.
Lock that door.
- Oh! - Ashley!
He's all right. It's only in the shoulder.
Get him on the bed where I can dress the wound.
I think I can walk.
It's not worth the effort.
Which way?
In here.
Mammy, I want hot water.
And lint for bandages.
What can I use for a probe?
If I only had my bag.
Were you really there? What did it look like?
Does she have cut-glass chandeliers, plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?
Good heavens, Mrs. Meade, remember yourself.
Captain Butler, tell me what happened, all that happened.
I was too late.
When I got to the Sullivan place, there had already been a skirmish.
I found Mr. Wilkes wounded, and Dr. Meade was with him.
I had to prove they'd been somewhere, anyplace but where they were.
- So I took them to Belle's.
- And she took them in?
She's by way of being an old friend of mine.
Oh, I'm sorry..
I'm sorry I couldn't think up a more dignified alibi.
This isn't the first time you've come between me and disaster.
It isn't likely that I'd question any device of yours.
And now I'll go and see what Dr. Meade needs.
Oh, Ashley.. Ashley..
Have you no interest in what's become of your own husband?
Did Frank go with you to Belle Watling's?
No.
Well, where is he?
He's lying out on Decatur Road..
..shot through the head.
He's dead.
Who is it?
It's Mrs. Watling.
Oh, Mrs. Watling. Won't you come in the house?
Oh, no, I couldn't do that, Mrs. Wilkes.
You come in and sit a minute with me.
How can I thank you enough for what you did for us?
I got your note saying you would call on me and thank me.
Why, Mrs. Wilkes, you must have lost your mind.
I came as soon as it was dark to say you mustn't think of any such thing.
Why, I'm..
Well, you're..
It wouldn't be fitting at all.
It wouldn't be fitting for me to thank a woman who saved my husband's life?
Mrs. Wilkes, there ain't never been a lady nice to me like you was.
I mean, about the money for the hospital.
I don't forget a kindness.
I thought about you being widowed with a little boy.. ..if Mr. Wilkes got hung.
He's a nice little boy, your boy is, Mrs. Wilkes.
I got a boy myself, so I..
You have?
Does he live..?
Oh, no, he ain't here in Atlanta. He ain't never been here.
He's off at school.
I ain't seen him since he was little.
Anyways, if it had been that Mrs. Kennedy's husband by hisself..
..I wouldn't have lifted a finger, no matter what Rhett said.
She's a mighty cold woman..
..prancing about Atlanta by herself.
She killed her husband same as if she shot him.
You mustn't say unkind things about my sister-in-law.
Please don't freeze me, Mrs. Wilkes.
I forgot how you liked her.
She just ain't in the same class with you, and I can't help it if I think so.
Well, anyways, I gotta be going.
I'm scared somebody'll recognize this carriage if I stay any longer.
That wouldn't do you no good.
And, Mrs. Wilkes, if you ever see me on the street..
..you don't have to speak to me.
I'll understand.
I should be proud to speak to you.
Proud to be under obligation to you.
I hope we meet again.
Oh, no.
That wouldn't be fitting.
- Good night, Mrs. Wilkes.
- Good night, Mrs. Watling.
And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.
She's brokenhearted about her husband.
Great balls of fire!
Captain Butler's here.
I told him you was prostrate with grief.
Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.
She says she's coming.
I don't know why she's coming, but she's coming.
You don't like me, Mammy.
Don't you argue with me. You don't. You really don't.
It's no good, Scarlett.
- What?
- The cologne.
I don't know what you mean.
I mean you've been drinking. Brandy. Quite a lot.
Well, what if I have? Is that any of your affair?
Don't drink alone.
People always find out, and it ruins a reputation.
What is it?
This is more than losing old Frank.
Oh, Rhett, I'm so afraid.
I don't believe it. You've never been afraid.
I'm afraid now. I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.
You look pretty healthy.
And maybe there isn't any hell.
Oh, there is. I know there is. I was raised on it.
Far be it from me to question the teachings of childhood.
Tell me what you've done that hell yawns before you.
I ought never to have married Frank.
He was Suellen's beau, and he loved her, not me.
And I made him miserable, and I killed him.
Yes, I did. I killed him.
Rhett, for the first time..
..I'm finding out what it is to be sorry for something I've done.
Here. Dry your eyes.
If you had it all to do over again, you'd do no differently.
You're like the thief who isn't sorry he stole..
..but he's terribly sorry he's going to jail.
I'm glad Mother's dead.
I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me.
I always wanted to be like her, calm and kind..
..and sadly, I've turned out disappointing.
You know, Scarlett, I think you're on the verge of a crying jag.
So I'll change the subject and say what I came to say.
Say it, then, and get out!
- What is it?
- I can't go on any longer without you.
Oh! You really are the most ill-bred man to come here at a time..
I made up my mind you were the only woman for me.. ..the first day I saw you.
Now you have a mill and Frank's money..
..and won't come to me as you did to the jail.
- So I see I shall have to marry you.
- I never heard of such bad taste.
Would you be convinced if I fell to my knees?
Turn me loose and get out.
Forgive me for startling you with my impetuous sentiments..
..my dear Scarlett..
I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.
But you must have noticed that for some time..
..the friendship I've felt for you has ripened into a deeper feeling.
A feeling more beautiful, more pure, more sacred..
Dare I name it? Can it be love?
Get up off your knees. I don't like your common jokes.
This is an honorable proposal of marriage.. ..made at what I consider a most opportune moment.
I can't go all my life waiting to catch you between husbands.
You're coarse and you're conceited.
And I think this conversation's gone far enough.
Besides, I shall never marry again.
Oh, yes, you will. And you'll marry me.
You?
You?
I don't love you.
And I don't like being married.
Ever think of marrying just for fun?
Marriage, fun?
Fiddle-dee-dee! Fun for men, you mean.
Do you want them to hear you?
You've been married to a boy and an old man.
Why not try a husband of the right age, with a way with women?
You're a fool, Rhett Butler..
..when you know I shall always love another man.
Stop it. You hear me? Stop it.
Don't. I shall faint.
I want you to faint. This is what you're meant for.
None of those fools have kissed you like this.
Your Charles or your Frank or your stupid Ashley.
Say you're going to marry me.
Say yes. Say yes.
Yes.
Are you sure you meant it? You don't want to take it back?
No.
Look at me, and try to tell me the truth.
Did you say yes because of my money?
Well, yes, partly.
Partly?
Well, you know, Rhett, money does help.
- And, of course, I am fond of you.
- Fond of me?
If I said I was madly in love with you, you'd know I was lying.
- You say we have a lot in common..
- Yes, you're right, my dear.
I'm not in love any more than you are.
Heaven help the man who ever really loves you.
What kind of ring would you like?
A diamond ring, and do buy a great big one.
You'll have the biggest and most vulgar ring in Atlanta.
I'll take you to New Orleans for the most expensive honeymoon.
- That'd be heavenly.
- I'll buy your trousseau for you too.
How wonderful..
..but you won't tell anybody, will you?
Still the little hypocrite.
Won't you kiss me goodbye?
You've had enough kissing for one afternoon.
You're impossible.
You can go. I don't care if you never come back.
But I will come back.
What are you thinking about, Scarlett?
I'm thinking about how rich we are.
I can keep the lumber business too?
Yes, of course you can, if it amuses you.
Now that you're so rich, you can tell everybody to go to the devil.
But you were the main one I wanted to go to the devil.
Don't scrape the plate. I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.
Oh, Rhett, can I have a chocolate one stuffed with meringue?
If you don't stop being a glutton, you'll get as fat as Mammy.
And I'll divorce you.
It'd be nice if you bought something for Mammy.
Why should I buy her a present when she called us both mules?
Mules? Why mules?
She said we could give ourselves air and get slicked up like racehorses..
..but we were just mules in horse harness and we didn't fool anybody.
I never heard anything more true.
Mammy's a smart old soul.
And one of the few people I know whose respect I'd like to have.
- I won't give her a thing.
- Then I'll take her a petticoat.
My mammy said when she went to heaven..
..she wanted a red taffeta petticoat so stiff that it'd stand by itself..
..and so rustley the Lord would say it's made of angels' wings.
She won't take it from you.
She'd rather die than wear it.
That may be. But I'm making the gesture just the same.
Wake up.
Wake up!
You were having another nightmare.
Oh, Rhett. Rhett, I was so cold and hungry and so tired.
I couldn't find it.
I ran through the mist and I couldn't find it.
- Find what, honey?
- I don't know.
I always dream the same dream, and I never know.
It seems to be hidden in the mist. Darling..
Oh, Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream that I found it, and that I'm safe?
Dreams don't work that way.
But when you get used to being safe and warm..
..you'll stop dreaming that dream.
And, Scarlett, I'm going to see that you are safe.
Rhett, would you do something for me if I asked you?
You know I would.
Will you take me away from here?
- Don't you like New Orleans?
- I love New Orleans..
..but I want to go home and visit Tara.
Will you take me to Tara?
Yes, Scarlett. Of course I will.
We'll go tomorrow.
You get your strength from this red earth of Tara.
You're part of it and it's part of you.
I'd give anything to have Tara the way it was before the war.
Would you?
Go ahead and make it that way.
Spend whatever you want.
Make it as fine a plantation as it ever was.
Oh, Rhett!
Rhett, you are good to me.
Can we still have our big new house in Atlanta?
Yes. And it can be as ornate as you want.
Marble terraces, stained-glass windows.
Won't everyone be jealous!
I want everybody who's been mean to me to be pea-green with envy.
I don't care.
Scarlett's hateful..
..building that new house just to show off!
And even taking our servants!
Oh, darling, you mustn't think unkindly of her.
She's made it possible for us to keep Tara, always.
Yes, and what good is Tara?
She's had three husbands, and I'll be an old maid!
Great Jehoshaphat! Great Jehoshaphat!
Lordy, we sure is rich now.
That's ridiculous! Why can't I go in?
I'm entitled to at least see what my own child looks like.
You control yourself.
You'll be seeing it for a long time.
I'd like to apologize about its not being a boy.
Oh, hush your mouth. Who wants a boy?
Boys aren't any use.
Don't you think I'm proof of that?
Have a drink of sherry.
Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?
She sure is.
You ever see a prettier one?
Miss Scarlett was mighty near that pretty when she come, but not quite.
Have another glass.
Mammy? What's that rustling noise I hear?
Lordy, that ain't nothing but my red silk petticoat you done give me.
Nothing but your petticoat?
I don't believe it.
Pull up your skirt.
Mr. Rhett, you is bad.
Yea, Lordy!
You sure took a long enough time about wearing it.
Yes, sir. Too long.
No more mule in horse's harness?
Mister Rhett, Miss Scarlett was bad telling you about that.
You ain't holding that against old Mammy, is you?
I don't hold it against you.
I just wanted to know.
Have another glass. Here, take the whole bottle.
Dr. Meade says you can go in now, Captain Butler.
This sure is a happy day to me.
I done diapered three generations of this family's girls.
And it sure is a happy day.
Oh, yes, Mammy. The happiest days are when babies come.
I wish..
Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful.
What do you suppose they'll name her?
Miss Scarlett done told me if it was a girl.. ..she was going to name it Eugenia Victoria.
Yes, she's a beautiful baby.
The most beautiful baby ever.
Yes..
Do you know that this is your birthday?
That you're a week old today?
Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony, the likes of which.. ..this town has never seen.
Yes, I'm going to send her to the best schools in Charleston.
Yes, and her will be received by the best families in the South.
And when it comes time for her to marry..
..well, she'll be a little princess.
Certainly making a fool of yourself.
Why shouldn't I?
She's the first person who's ever completely belonged to me.
Great balls of fire! I had the baby, didn't I?
- It's Melanie.
May I come in? - Come in.
Yes, come in and look at my daughter's beautiful blue eyes.
Most babies have blue eyes when they're born.
Don't tell him anything. He knows everything about babies.
Nevertheless, her eyes are blue and they'll stay blue.
As blue as the Bonnie Blue flag.
That's it. That's what we'll call her. "Bonnie Blue Butler."
Try again, Mammy.
Twenty inches.
Twenty inches.
I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.
You simply gotta make it 181/2 again.
You done had a baby.
And you ain't never gonna be no 181/2 inches again. There ain't nothing to do about it.
There is something to do about it.
I'm just not going to get old and fat before my time.
I just won't have any more babies.
I heard Mr. Rhett say that he'd be wanting a son next year.
Tell Captain Butler I decided not to go out.
I'll have supper in my room.
I got your message.
I'll have them bring my supper up here too.
No objections to that, I hope?
No. Yes.
Uh..
I mean, I don't care where you have your supper.
Rhett..
- Yes?
- You see..
Well, I've decided..
Well, I hope I don't have any more children.
My pet, as I told you before Bonnie was born..
..it's immaterial to me whether you have one child or 20.
No, but you know what I..
Do you know what I mean? I do.
And do you know I can divorce you for this?
You're low enough to think of that.
If you had any chivalry in you, or were nice..
Look at Ashley Wilkes.
Melanie can't have any more children and he..
You've been to the lumber office this afternoon.
What has that got to do with it?
Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.
Pray, go on, Mrs. Butler. It's no use.
You wouldn't understand.
- You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.
- Sorry for me?
Yes, sorry for you because you throw away happiness with both hands..
..and reach out for something that'll never make you happy.
I don't know what you're talking about.
If you were free and Melly were dead and you had your precious Ashley..
..do you think you'd be happy?
You'd never know him, never even understand his mind..
..any more than you understand anything, except money.
Never mind about that. I want..
You may keep your sanctity.
It'll work no hardship on me.
You don't care?
The world is full of many things and people..
..and I shan't be lonely.
I will find comfort elsewhere.
Well, that's fine.
But I warn you, in case you change your mind, I intend to lock my door. Why bother?
If I wanted to come in, no lock could keep me out.
I knew most women were cheats..
..hypocritical and hard, but this one.. - It ain't no use.
- What do you mean?
I mean you're poisoned with her.
I don't care what she's done to you. You're still in love with her.
- It pleasures me none to say it.
- Maybe so, but I'm through with her.
You've gotta think of the child.
Child's worth 10 of the mother.
You're a shrewd woman, Belle.
And a very nice one.
Yes, Rhett?
I was just thinking of the difference between you and..
You're both hardheaded businesswomen, and successful.
But you've got a heart, Belle.
And you're honest.
Goodbye, Rhett.
Goodbye, Belle.
She'll be a wonderful horsewoman.
Look at those hands. And that seat!
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!
Why we have to wheel a baby when we have servants..
- Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.
- Captain Butler. Good morning, Scarlett.
Making fools of ourselves in front of these buffaloes.
If you'd thought of your position, you wouldn't have to.
But as it is, we're going to cultivate every female dragon of the Old Guard..
- Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.
- Captain Butler.
Good morning, Scarlett.
So the millionaire speculator is turning respectable.
Money can't buy what I want for Bonnie.
I'll admit I've been at fault too.
Bonnie will have a place among decent people.
Even if we both have to crawl on our bellies to every fat old cat..
Good morning, Mrs. Meade.
Good morning, Captain Butler.
Good morning, Scarlett.
Mrs. Merriwether, I have great regard for your knowledge.
- Could you give me some advice? - Why, certainly.
My Bonnie sucks her thumb.
I can't stop her.
You should make her stop! It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.
I know, I know. She has such a beautiful mouth too.
- I tried putting soap on her nails.
- Soap? Bah!
Put quinine on her thumb and she'll stop sucking it quick enough. Quinine!
I never would have thought of it.
I can't thank you enough.
You've taken a great load off my mind.
Good morning.
Good morning, Dolly.
Wasn't that Captain Butler?
Good morning, Caroline. I was just thinking..
..there's a great deal of good in a man who would love a child so much.
But of course there is.
Fanny Elsing told Dr. Meade that Captain Butler finally admitted..
..that he was honored for his services at the Battle of Franklin.
No, and did I tell you that Captain Butler made..
..a stupendous contribution to the Association for the Beautification.. - ..of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?
- No!
My grandbaby, Napoleon Picard, is giving a party for Bonnie next week.
Why, Dolly Merriwether, it was my idea to give a party for Bonnie.
Why, Caroline Meade, how can you say a thing like that?
Watch Daddy put your pony over it, Bonnie.
Now, watch!
Daddy, let me!
Let me!
All right, darling.
Put her on, Pork.
Up we go!
Lordy mercy! There he goes again.
Grip tightly with your legs. Lean forward and go with him.
Hold your reins properly in a firm hand.
That was fine. I knew you'd do it.
When you're older, I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.
You'll be the best horsewoman in the South.
Give your daddy a kiss.
Mr. Rhett? Mr. Rhett! Mr. Rhett!
Did you see her? Wasn't she wonderful?
Mr. Rhett, I done told you and told you..
..it just ain't fitting' for a girl to ride astraddle with her dress flying up. All right.
I'll teach her to ride sidesaddle.
And I'll buy her a blue velvet riding habit. She'll love that.
A nice black broadcloth is what little girls wear.
Oh, now, Mammy, be reasonable.
Well, I don't think it's fitting', but..
It ain't fitting', it just ain't fitting'.
It ain't fitting'.
Why, Scarlett, what are you doing downtown at this time of day?
Well, Ashley, I just..
Why aren't you helping Melly with my surprise birthday party?
Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed to know anything about that.
Melly'd be so disappointed if you weren't surprised.
I won't let on.
I'll be the most surprised man in Atlanta.
As long as you're here, let me show you the books..
..so you can see how bad a businessman I am.
Don't let's fool with any books today.
When I'm wearing a new bonnet..
..all the figures I ever knew go right out of my head.
Figures are well lost when the bonnet's as pretty as that.
Scarlett, you know, you get prettier all the time.
You haven't changed a bit since our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks..
..where you sat under a tree surrounded by dozens of beaus.
That girl doesn't exist anymore.
Nothing's turned out as I expected, Ashley.
Nothing.
Yes, we've traveled a long road since the old days, haven't we?
Oh, the lazy days..
..the warm, still, country twilight..
..the high, soft Negro laughter from the quarters..
..the golden warmth and security of those days.
Don't look back, Ashley.
Don't look back.
It drags at your heart till.. ..you can't do anything but look back.
I didn't mean to make you sad, my dear.
I never want you to be anything but completely happy.
Oh, Ashley!
- Who is it?
- Only your husband.
Come in.
Am I actually being invited into the sanctuary?
You're not ready for Melanie's party.
I've got a headache, Rhett.
You go without me and make my excuses to Melanie.
What a white-livered little coward you are! Get up!
You're going to that party and you'll have to hurry.
- Has India dared..? - Yes, India has.
- Everyone in town knows the story.
- Kill them for spreading lies.
I don't kill people who tell the truth.
No time to argue. I won't go!
I can't go until this misunderstanding clears up.
You won't cheat Melly out of publicly ordering you out of her house.
There was nothing wrong. India hates me so. I can't go.
If you don't show your face tonight, you'll never be able to again.
I don't care, but you won't ruin Bonnie's chances.
You're going to that party, for her sake. Get dressed.
Wear that.
Nothing modest or matronly will do for this occasion.
And put on plenty of rouge.
I want you to look your part tonight.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny Which nobody can deny Which nobody can deny
- Good night, Scarlett.
- But, Rhett..
You're going into the arena alone.
The lions are hungry. Don't leave me.
Don't.
You're not afraid?
What a lovely dress, darling.
India wasn't able to come.
Will you be an angel?
I do need you to help me receive my guests.
Mrs. Meade.. ..here's our darling Scarlett.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Why, Scarlett.
- Good evening.
Ashley, aren't you going to get our Scarlett a glass of punch?
Did you have a good time at Miss Melly's party? Yes.
Now, Mammy, be sure and leave word.
If Captain Butler asks for me when he comes back, I'm asleep.
Yes'm.
Come in, Mrs. Butler.
Come here.
Sit down.
No reason you shouldn't have a nightcap, even if I am here. I didn't want a drink.
I heard a noise..
You heard nothing of the kind. You wouldn't have come if you thought I was here.
- You must need a drink badly. - I do not.
Take it.
Don't give yourself airs.
I know you drink on the quiet, and I know how much you drink.
Do you think I care if you like your brandy?
- You're drunk and I'm going to bed.
- I'm very drunk..
..and I intend getting still drunker before the evening's over.
But you're not going to bed. Not yet.
Sit down.
So she stood by you, did she?
How's it feel to have the woman you've wronged cloak your sins?
You're wondering if she knows all about you and Ashley.
You're wondering if she did it just to save face.
You're thinking she's a fool for doing it, even if it saved your hide..
- I will not listen.
- Yes, you'll listen.
Miss Melly's a fool, but not the kind you think.
She has too much honor to conceive of dishonor in anyone she loves.
And she loves you.
Though just why she does, I'm sure I don't know.
If you weren't so drunk and insulting, I could explain everything.
- As it is, though.. - You get out of that chair once more..
Of course, the comic figure in all this is the long-suffering Mr. Wilkes.
Mr. Wilkes, who can't be mentally faithful to his wife..
..and won't be unfaithful to her technically.
- Why doesn't he make up his mind?
- Rhett, you..
Observe my hands, my dear.
I could tear you to pieces with them.
And I'd do it if it'd take Ashley out of your mind forever.
But it wouldn't.
So I'll remove him from your mind forever, this way.
I'll put my hands so.
One on each side of your head.
And I'll smash your skull between them like a walnut.
And that'll block him out.
Take your hands off me, you drunken fool!
You know, I've always admired your spirit, my dear.
Never more than now, when you're cornered. I'm not cornered.
You'll never corner me or frighten me.
You've lived in dirt so long, you can't understand anything else.
You're jealous of something you can't understand. Good night.
Jealous, am I?
Yes, I suppose I am.
Even though I know you've been faithful to me all along.
How do I know?
Because I know Ashley Wilkes and his honorable breed.
They're gentlemen.
That's more than I can say for you or for me.
We're not gentlemen.
And we have no honor, have we?
It's not that easy, Scarlett.
You turn me out while you chase Ashley, while you dream of Ashley.
This is one night you're not turning me out.
How are you feeling this morning?
Well, this misery in my back.. ..ain't so good.
You act mighty happy this morning.
I am, Mammy. I am.
Oh, she wept with delight When he gave her a smile
And trembled with fear at his frown
I, um.. I'd like to extend my apology for my conduct of last night.
Oh, but, Rhett.
I was very drunk..
..and quite swept off my feet by your charms.
You needn't bother to apologize. Nothing you do surprises me.
I've been thinking, and I believe it would be better for both of us..
..if we admitted we made a mistake and got a divorce.
- A divorce? - Yes.
There's no point in holding on to each other.
I'll provide for you. You've plenty of grounds.
Just give me Bonnie, and you can say what you please.
Thank you, but I wouldn't dream of disgracing the family with a divorce.
You'd disgrace it if Ashley were free.
Makes my head spin to think how quickly you'd divorce me.
Wouldn't you?
Answer me. Wouldn't you?
Please go now and leave me alone.
I'm going. That's what I came to tell you.
I'm going on a very extended trip to London.
- And I'm leaving today. - Oh.
I'm taking Bonnie with me.
Please get her duds packed right away.
You'll never take my child out of this house.
She's my child too. You're mistaken if you think I'm leaving her here..
..with a mother who doesn't consider her reputation.
You're a fine one to talk.
You think I'll let her out when you'll have her around people like Belle?
If you were a man, I'd break your neck for that.
I'll thank you to shut your mouth.
As for you giving yourself airs about motherhood.. ..a cat's a better mother than you are.
Have her things packed for me in an hour, or I warn you..
..I've always thought a lashing with a whip would benefit you immensely.
Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.
- Hello, Uncle Rhett.
- Hello, Beau.
Daddy, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you all morning.
I've been hunting for a rabbit skin to wrap my little Bonnie in.
Give your best sweetheart a kiss.
Bonnie, I'm going to take you on a long trip to fairyland.
Where? Where?
I'll show you the Tower of London, where the little princes were..
..and London Bridge.
London Bridge?
Will it be falling down?
Well, it will if you want it to, darling.
Daddy, dark!
Dark! Bonnie!
Bonnie! It's all right, Bonnie. Who put out that light?
Nurse! - Daddy, dark!
- Yes, yes, yes.. What's the matter with my Bonnie?
A bear!
Oh, a bear?
A big bear?
Dreadful big! And he sat on my chest!
I'll stay here and shoot him if he comes back.
Oh, good evening, Mr. Butler.
I told you never to leave this child alone in the dark.
Children are often afraid of the dark, but they get over it.
Let her scream for a night.. Let her scream?
Either you're a fool or an inhuman woman.
If you want her to grow up cowardly.. Cowardly?
There isn't a cowardly bone in her body.
You're discharged.
As you say, sir.
Where's Mother?
Bonnie..
Aren't you happy here in London with me? I wanna go home.
Miss Bonnie! And Captain Butler!
Miss Scarlett!
Hello, Mammy!
Honey child!
Miss Scarlett, they's back.
They's back! Bonnie! Bonnie, baby.
Darling baby! You glad to be home?
Daddy gave me a kitten.
But London's a horrid place.
Where's my pony?
I wanna go out and see my pony.
You go out and see your pony.
Where's my pony?
I want to go out and see my pony.
You run along with Mammy.
Come on, honey child. Mammy sure missed you, honey.
Mrs. Butler, I believe.
Mammy said you'd come back.
Only to bring Bonnie.
Apparently any mother, even a bad one, is better than none.
You mean you're going away again?
What perception, Mrs. Butler. Right away.
- In fact, I left my bags at the station.
You're looking pale.
Is there a shortage of rouge?
Or can this wanness mean you've been missing me?
If I'm pale, it's your fault.
Not because I've been missing you, but because..
Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.
It's because I'm going to have a baby.
Indeed.
And who's the happy father? You know it's yours.
I don't want it any more than you do.
No woman would want the child of a cad like you.
I wish it were anybody's child but yours!
Well, cheer up. Maybe you'll have an accident.
Is she better?
Has she asked for me?
Don't you understand? She's delirious.
Rhett..
I want Rhett!
What's the matter, honey?
Did you call somebody, child?
It's no use. It's no use!
Dr. Meade's left.
- Scarlett's dead.
- Oh, no, she's much better.
Really she is.
There, there, Captain Butler, you're beside yourself.
She'll very soon be well again. I promise you.
She never wanted this baby.
Not want a baby?
Why, every woman wants a baby.
You do, but she doesn't. Not my children.
She told me she didn't want any more.
I wanted to hurt her because she'd hurt me.
And I did.
You mustn't tell me these things. It's not fair to..
I didn't know about this baby until she fell.
If I'd only known, I'd have come straight home.
Well, of course you would.
And then when she told me there on the steps, what did I do? What did I say?
I laughed and I said..
But you didn't mean it.
I know you didn't mean it.
But I did mean it.
I was crazy with jealousy.
She's never cared for me. I tried to make her care, but I couldn't.
You're so wrong. Scarlett loves you a great deal.
Much more than she knows.
If that were true, I'd wait forever.
If she'd only forgive me.
She will. You must be patient.
No, it's not possible.
If you only knew who she really loved..
You wouldn't believe it.
Surely you haven't listened to idle gossip.
No, Captain Butler. I wouldn't believe it.
There, there. Scarlett's going to get well, and there can be other babies.
She couldn't even if she wanted to.
But of course she could!
I'm going to.
No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it.
It's too dangerous.
Children are life renewing itself, Captain Butler.
And when life does that, danger seems very unimportant.
I've never before known anyone who was really brave.
I pray God things go well with you, Miss Melly.
And I want to thank you for all you've done for me and for Scarlett.
From my heart, I thank you.
Miss Scarlett's feeling a heap better today, Mr. Rhett.
Thank you, Mammy.
I've come to ask your forgiveness..
..hoping our life together has another chance.
Our life together?
When did we ever have a life together?
Yes, you're right.
But I'm sure if we could only try again, we could be happy.
What is there to make us happy now?
Well, there's Bonnie..
..and I love you, Scarlett.
When did you discover that?
I've always loved you, but you've never given me a chance to show it.
And just what do you want me to do?
To begin with, give up the mill, Scarlett.
We'll go away. We'll take Bonnie and have another honeymoon. Give up the mill?
It's making more money than ever.
I know, but we don't need it. Sell it.
Or give it to Ashley.
Melanie's been such a friend to us. Melanie!
If you'd only think more about me!
I am thinking of you.
And I'm thinking that, well..
..maybe the mill's taking you away from me and Bonnie. I know what you're thinking.
Don't bring Bonnie into it.
- You're taking her away from me.
- But she loves you.
You've made her love you and not me.
She's so spoiled now, that..
Mommy, Daddy! Watch me.
We're watching, darling.
You're mighty pretty, precious.
So are you. I'm going to jump. Watch me, Daddy.
I don't think you ought to do much jumping yet.
You just learned to ride sidesaddle.
I will so jump. I can jump better than ever, because I've grown.
I moved the bar higher.
Don't let her do it, Rhett.
No, Bonnie, you can't.
If you fall off, don't cry and blame me!
Rhett, stop her.
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
She's just like Pa.
Just like Pa..!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Lordy, Miss Melly. I sure is glad you's come.
Oh, Mammy, this house won't seem the same without Bonnie.
How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?
Miss Melly, this here's done broke her heart.
I didn't fetch you on Miss Scarlett's account.
What that child got to stand, the good Lord give her strength to stand.
It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.
He done lost his mind these last couple of days.
Oh, no, Mammy, no.
I ain't never seen no man, black or white, set such store on any child.
When Dr. Meade say her neck broke..
..Mr. Rhett grabbed his gun and run out and shoot that poor pony.
And for a minute, I think he gonna shoot hisself.
Oh, poor Captain Butler.
Miss Scarlett called him a murderer for teaching that child to jump.
She said, "You give me my baby what you killed."
And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't never cared nothing about Miss Bonnie.
It like to turn my blood cold, the things they say to one another.
Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.
And then that night..
..Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself in the nursery with Miss Bonnie.
He wouldn't open the door when Miss Scarlett beat on it and hollered.
And that's where he's been for two whole days.
Oh, Mammy!
This evening, Miss Scarlett shouted through the door and said:
"The funeral's set for tomorrow."
He says, "You try that, and I kills you tomorrow."
"Do you think I's gonna put my child in the dark when she's so scared of it?"
Oh, Mammy, Mammy!
- He has lost his mind!
- Yes'm, that's the God's truth. He ain't gonna let us bury that child. You gotta help us.
Oh, but I can't intrude.
If you can't help us, who can?
Mr. Rhett always set great store by your opinion.
Please, Miss Melly.
I'll do what I can, Mammy.
Get away from that door and leave us alone.
It's Mrs. Wilkes, Captain Butler. Please let me in.
I've come to see Bonnie.
Oh, Lord, please help Mr. Rhett in this hour of his grief.
Mammy.. I want you to make a good deal of strong coffee..
..and bring it up to Captain Butler. I'll go and see Miss Scarlett.
But..
Captain Butler's willing for the funeral to take place tomorrow morning.
Hallelujah! I expect the angels fights on your side, Miss Melly.
Miss Melly! Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy.
And try.. Try to get me home.
Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
Where is my mother going away to?
And why can't I go along, please?
We can't always go along, Beau, as much as we may want to.
You're going back to bed now.
Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying.
She can't be.
She hasn't your strength. She's never had any.
- She's never had anything but heart.
- You knew that too?
Why do I have to go back to bed? It's morning.
It isn't really morning yet.
You may come in now, Scarlett.
Dr. Meade, please let me see her. I've been waiting here two days.
I've got to tell her that I was wrong about something.
She knows you were wrong. She wants to see Scarlett.
Miss Melly's going to die in peace.
Don't ease your conscience.. ..telling her things that make no difference now.
You understand?
It's me, Melly.
Promise me?
Anything.
Look after my little son.
I gave him to you once before. Remember?
The day he was born.
Please, Melly, don't talk this way.
I know you'll get well.
Promise me.. college.
Yes, and Europe, and a pony. Whatever he wants, but..
..oh, Melly, do try.
Ashley..
What about Ashley, Melly?
Look after him for me..
..just as you looked after me.. ..for him.
I will, Melly.
Look after him..
..but never let him know.
Good night.
Promise?
What else, Melly?
Captain Butler.
- Be kind to him.
- Rhett?
He loves you so.
Yes, Melly.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
You ladies may come in now.
Rhett..
Ashley!
I don't know where the mate to this is.
She must've put it away.
Stop it! Hold me. I'm so frightened!
I'm so frightened!
Scarlett, what can I do?
I can't live without her.
Everything I ever had is going with her.
Oh, Ashley..
You really love her, don't you?
She's the only dream I ever had that didn't die in the face of reality.
Dreams. Always dreams with you. Never common sense.
Scarlett, if you knew what I've gone through!
Ashley, you should've told me years ago that you loved her and not me.
And not left me dangling with your talk of honor.
But you had to wait till now, now when Melly's dying..
..to show me that I could never mean any more to you.. ..than this Watling woman does to Rhett.
And I've loved something that doesn't really exist.
But somehow..
..I don't care.
Somehow, it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter one bit.
Oh, Ashley.. Ashley, forgive me.
Don't cry.
She mustn't see you've been crying.
Ashley!
Melly!
Melly!
Rhett! Rhett!
Rhett, where are you?
Rhett, wait for me!
Rhett, wait for me!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Come in.
Rhett..
Melanie, she's..?
Well, God rest her.
She was the only completely kind person I ever knew.
A great lady. A very great lady.
So she's dead. That makes it nice for you, doesn't it?
How can you say such a thing?
You know how I loved her, really.
No, I don't know that I do.
It's to your credit that you could appreciate her.
Of course I appreciated her. She thought of everybody except herself.
- Why, her last words were about you.
- What did she say?
She said, "Be kind to Captain Butler.."
"..he loves you so."
- Did she say anything else?
She asked me to look after Ashley too.
It's convenient to have the first wife's permission, isn't it?
What do you mean?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving you, my dear.
All you need now is a divorce, and your dreams of Ashley can come true.
Oh, no!
No, you're wrong. Terribly wrong.
I don't want a divorce.
Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight, when I knew I loved you..
..I ran home to tell you. Oh, darling, darling!
Please don't go on with this.
Leave us some dignity out of our marriage.
Spare us this last.
This last?
Do listen to me! I must have loved you for years, only..
..I was such a fool, I didn't know it.
Please believe me. You must care.
Melly said you did.
I believe you. And what about Ashley Wilkes?
I never really loved Ashley.
You certainly gave a good imitation of it, up to this morning.
No, Scarlett. I've tried everything.
If you'd met me halfway, even when I came back from London.
I was so glad to see you. I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.
Then when you were sick, and it was all my fault.
I hoped that you'd call for me. But you didn't.
I wanted you. I wanted you desperately..
..but I didn't think you wanted me.
It seems we've been at cross purposes, doesn't it?
But it's no use now.
As long as there was Bonnie, there was a chance we might be happy.
I liked to think that Bonnie was you, a little girl again.
Before the war and poverty had done things to you.
She was so like you.
And I could pet her and spoil her, as I wanted to spoil you.
But when she went, she took everything.
Rhett, please don't say that.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry for everything.
My darling, you're such a child.
You think that by saying, "I'm sorry," all the past can be corrected.
Here, take my handkerchief.
Never, in any crisis of your life, have I known you to have a handkerchief.
Rhett! Rhett, where are you going?
I'm going to Charleston, back where I belong.
Please. Please take me with you.
No. I'm through with everything here.
I want peace.
I want to see if somewhere.. ..there isn't something left in life of charm and grace.
- You know what I'm talking about?
- No! - I only know that I love you!
- That's your misfortune.
Rhett!
Rhett! Rhett!
Rhett!
If you go, where shall I go? What shall I do?
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
I can't let him go.
There must be some way to bring him back.
Oh, I can't think about this now.
I'll go crazy if I do.
I'll think about it tomorrow.
But I must think about it!
What is there to do?
What is there that matters?
You mean to tell me, Scarlett, Tara doesn't mean anything?
Land's the only thing that matters.
It's the only thing that lasts.
Something you love more than me, though you may not know it.
Tara. It's this from which you get your strength, the red earth of Tara.
Land's the only thing that matters.
The only thing that lasts.
Something you love more than me, though you may not know it.
..from which you get your strength.
Tara.
Land's the only thing that matters.
Something you love more.
- ..the red earth of Tara.
- Tara! - Tara!
Tara!
Home. I'll go home.
And I'll think of some way to get him back.
After all, tomorrow is another day!

Private Van, you'll ride with the driver.
Okay, pal.
You can't cross Fifth Avenue until the parade is finished.
- How long will that be?
- Don't ask me, buddy.
Goodbye, babe.
We'll miss you terribly.
Yeah, don't kid the troops.
Goodbye, honey.
Remember?
You promised to write.
Sure, sure.
Every day.
Hey, goodbye, beautiful.
Goodbye, Harry.
What's the new address?
Care of NVA, National Vaudeville Artists.
They'll know where I am.
Goodbye.
Hey, you've been swell to me.
Oh, you've been wonderful to us, Harry.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Goodbye!
Don't forget, Harry.
One of these days we're gonna see his name up in electric lights, biggest star on Broadway.
You ought to realize, Harry, this is the wrong season to be looking for openings in outdoor stuff.
Every carnival attraction is set.
You should've come back sooner.
Yeah, I know.
I shouldn't have let the war last so long.
- But you ain't licked.
- No, I ain't licked.
No, all your friends, and you got a million of 'em, they all have the utmost respect for you, Harry.
Sure, sure.
Plenty of respect, but no job.
Oh, now don't be like that, Harry.
You'll get a job.
You, with your talent and fine war record.
All we gotta do is slap a little ad in the Billboard, and... before you know it--
So you went into a speakeasy and told the man you wanted a cocktail, did you?
- And I suppose you drank the cocktail.
- Huh?
I merely asked, did you drink the cocktail?
You can't expect me to believe that you went into a speakeasy and told the man you wanted a cocktail, and then didn't drink it? Oh, come now.
I couldn't.
- Why not?
Were you paralyzed?
- No!
I didn't drink it because...
- Because why?
- Because the Manhattan any.

Now, the miracle remedy.
Old Doctor Maltee's Marvelous Elixir.
Discovered in the desert of Arizona by Warhoo, chief of the Kickapoo Indians.
Right, Chief?
Unfortunately, Chief Warhoo doesn't speak a word of English or he'd tell you all about it.
But words don't mean a thing, friends.
You'll have to try the medicine to find out the marvelous results.
Cheese it, Harry, the cops.
Well, what do you want?
Madam, I bring you the golden gilt of knowledge, the new University Encyclopedia.
It tells you the facts of life.
I don't want any facts.
I got too many of them already.
As I pass among you, I shall ask you to produce some objects, either from your pockets or wearing apparel.
These will be identified instantly by Madame Zuleika.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
Please note that I have no radio broadcasting sets concealed.
This is entirely mental.
All I ask of you is that you concentrate.
Just anyone, any object.
Oh, Thank you.
Thank you, Madame.
Speak.
Hurry up!
What is it?
Concentrate!
Say something.
Hurry up!
What am I holding?
Concentrate!
It's, uh... medicine.
What kind?
Concentrate!
Headache powders.
Very good, Zuleika!
Thank you, Madame.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to say, the charges have been made that all these articles which I obtained, and which are identified instantly by the telepathic genius of Madame Zuleika, have been handed to me by confederates of mine
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want once and for all to disprove these ridiculous charges before you, the good citizens of this fair city of Omaha.
We have the good fortune to have with us tonight, sitting right up here, the honorable Thomas MacCreevy, and his very charming wife, Mrs. MacCreevy.
I shall ask them to furnish me with an object.
I'm sure that you all know that the honorable Thomas MacCreevy and his very lovely wife are no confederates of mine.
We don't know no such thing!
I shall treat that remark with the contempt it so richly deserves.
Now, Mr. MacCreevy, if you will be so kind.
Or perhaps, Mrs. MacCreevy will oblige.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very kindly.
Now, we can get it.
Concentrate.
Uh, concentrate!
Concentrate!
Do you see that water she's drinking?
It's gin.
Now you can't keep Mrs. MacCreevy waiting.
Concentrate!
There's... a disturbance here.
Telepathic waves are all... all confused.
- She's drunk!
- Sure.
We...
We must dispel this confusion.
The waves must get through.
Uh, everybody concentrate!
Now, can't you concentrate?
"Now, can't you concentrate?" "Now, can't you concentrate?"
Concentrate.
It's a vanity case!
- It's what?
- A vanity case!
It's a vanity case.
- Tell 'em to bring down that curtain.
- Yes, sir.
Your kind attention for just one moment!
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, one and all, please remember that the greatest scientists sometimes slip up with their experiments.
So, with your kind indulgence, we will continue with our performance and attempt to demonstrate--
So, the whole audience could hear?
The whole dumb audience?
- Quiet!
- Some dame.
Where is she?
I'll break her neck!
Was it you?
- Me?
- Yes, you!
You cheap little acrobat!
You were standing in the wings when we went on!
Why, I was talking to this gentleman, wasn't I?
- Sure.
- I wasn't even watching your stupid act, was I?
- No.
- I'll find out who it was!
And when I do, I'll beat the living tar out of her!
Shut up!
Shut up, Madame!
What I wanna know is who rung that curtain down?
- Yes!
- I did!
What about it?
Nothing.
I just wanted to know.
Well, now you do know.
Come on, next act!
Flash the orchestra!
- Ready, Fellara?
- Just a minute.
They're deliberately trying to ruin...
Excuse me, Mr. Van.
The whole cheesy bunch is out to get us!
Clear the stage!
- Come on, Madame, let's get out of here.
- You ready, Fellara?
- Take it away.
- All right, all right!
Who do you suppose hollered at Zuleika from the wings?
I don't know.
Probably the ghost of PT Barnum trying to help out a pal.
What's gonna happen to you now, Harry?
Well, she'll have a fine hangover tomorrow.
Then, she'll take the pledge and swear she'll never take another drink, so help her.
And then, next week in Little Rock, she'll feel another cold coming on, and it'll be the same thing all over again.
Then, one day, you'll look at Billboard and see
"Harry Van At Liberty" again.
Yeah, that's show business.
Oh, yes, yes.
The gay, carefree world of entertainment.
Come on, old lady.
- Good night, Harry.
- Good night, Jim.
Good night, Moppo.
Be a good girl.
Well, what can I do for you?
If it's an autograph, I'm sorry, I never learned to read or write.
No, I'm not collecting autographs, Mr. Van.
I have something rather important to tell you.
What is it, babe?
Do you mind if I sit down?
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
But anyway, have a seat.
And if you see a bottle of champagne standing around, open her up.
Now, what's on your mind?
I want to confess.
You'll find the church right around the corner.
I was the one that prompted Madame Zuleika.
- You?
- Yes, I couldn't help it, Mr.--
Say, who are you, anyway?
I'm one of the Fellara troupe.
- Yes, I know you're an acrobat, but what--
- Oh, you noticed me.
Well, we've been on the same bill a week, haven't we?
Yes, but you never seem to pay any attention to anyone.
Say, why did you holler out like that tonight and ruin the act?
Anybody can see that she was in an alcoholic fog, so thick that your signals couldn't get through it.
I knew what you were trying to say.
Well, how did you know that?
I've been watching your act, Mr. Van.
I couldn't help picking up some of the code.
I mean, your tone of voice when you say "Concentrate."
There are subtle changes that mean different things.
Where did you learn words like "subtle"?
Oh, I haven't always been an acrobat, Mr. Van.
I attended the University in Vienna.
I've worked with Freud, Jung, all the great teachers.
From the University in Vienna to the Eldorado in Omaha.
- Some jump.
- Yes.
That's been my whole life.
Today, the mountain tops.
Tomorrow, the Dead Sea.
Yeah, I guess you're right, sister.
But you haven't yet explained why you tried to feed Madame Zuleika.
I had to, Mr. Van, because...
Because I have a great admiration for you.
Oh!
You like my electrical personality, huh?
No, nothing as obvious as that.
I think you have a very remarkable brain.
So, you've noticed that, too, hmm?
I also have a very remarkable brain.
Yeah, and a very remarkable way of talking for a girl who makes her living swinging by her teeth.
Well, I was born for excitement, adventure, danger.
I've had all of them.
I'll have a lot more before I come to a violent death.
So, you even got that arranged.
Well...
So, what are your plans for supper?
Oh, Mr. Van!
Are you inviting me?
Well, don't look at me like that.
I'm only offering to buy you a cup of coffee because I appreciate your kind motives in busting up our act tonight.
Oh, that's very sweet of you, Mr. Van.
I'll get dressed right away.
I'll be proud to be seen in a restaurant with you.
Wait till you see the restaurant.
Here it is.
Daka's Place-Eats.
Oh, what beautiful simplicity in those words.
- They tell the whole story.
- Yeah.
Evening, Daka.
How you are, Mr. Van?
How you are, lady?
Special tonight, corned beef hash.
Corned beef hash is always special.
Give me a cup of coffee and some doughnuts.
- What'll you have, babe?
- Oyster stew.
Are the oysters strictly fresh?
Oh, sure.
We fly 'em in every day from Baltimore in airplane.
- Oyster stew.
- Oyster stew!
And I'll have corned beef hash with two poached eggs, whole-wheat toast buttered, and grade A milk.
- Okay.
- Aren't you gonna have some dessert?
Oh, yes.
I'll order that later.
I guess you have to eat a lot to keep your teeth in training for that iron jaw act, huh?
Yes!
In old Russia, we used to serve an entire roast ox before lunch just as an hors d'oeuvre.
You've certainly lived on a big scale, babe.
My name isn't Babe.
It's Irene.
Don't worry about that.
I call everybody "babe."
Perhaps that's why I don't like it.
I'm not everybody.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I should have realized you're pretty exclusive.
I am.
But I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Mr. Van.
That's all right.
I'm not seriously injured.
You see, I was really born to live in a palace.
So, it isn't always easy for me to adjust myself to Daka's Place-Eats.
Well, here's your food.
Perhaps that'll help the adjustment.
85 cents.
She hasn't finished ordering yet.
Careful how you handle those knees.
- Ouch!
- Yeah.
Yeah, you gotta do it like this.
That's a technique you learn after you get the Ritz out of your mind.
Oh, I haven't got a table napkin.
I'll get it.
Ain't one napkin enough?
Not for a repast like this.
Thank you very much, Mr. Van.
Hey, listen, Irene, you can discard the Mr. Van.
- My name's Harry.
- But I don't like Harry.
What's the matter with it?
It sounds cheap.
Isn't your name Henry?
No.
And it isn't Harold either.
Very well, Harry.
Whatever I call you, I think you're sweet.
Eat your stew.
Where did you get your education, Harry?
What makes you think I got one?
Oh, I know you have.
You're like me.
You're a student of life.
Well, I worked my way through college selling encyclopedias.
I knew you had culture.
What college was it?
Oh, no college in particular.
But, you know, my line of selling talk was so good, I fell for it myself.
I bought the whole dull bunch of encyclopedias and read 'em from cover to cover.
Here, try the hash.
Oh, there isn't any ketchup.
No.
So there isn't.
Excuse me, babe.
You're so very kind.
Yeah, I think you're right.
You know what makes my blood boil?
I mean, it makes me so furious to think that you're only a...
- What is the word for it?
- Word for what?
A stooge.
That's it.
A stooge for that drunken old hag.
Hey, choose your words more carefully, babe.
I tell you, my name is Irene.
Well, whatever it is, no cracks out of you about Zuleika.
She's a very wonderful, wonderful woman.
A genius!
And besides that, I'm not a stooge.
I'm the one who does the real brain work in the act.
You know, Harry, I can learn that code easily.
- You think so?
- I know I could.
Oh, I don't know.
It's a very deep, complicated scientific problem.
Oh, we'd be perfect together, you and me.
I can see the electric sign shining over Piccadilly Circus in London.
It reads "Irene."
Irene the Great!
Assisted by Harry Van.
Hmm, you got nice billing there.
Oh, you'd love London.
I was there as a little girl after I escaped from the Soviets.
Oh, that was a terrible experience.
I must tell you about it, Mr. Van.
Yes.
All right, all right.
But you've got four shows tomorrow, and seeing as how you're still an acrobat, you better get some sleep.
Listen.
Do you know that song?
It's Kak Stranno.
It's Russian.
Oh, it's so lovely.
It takes me back so far to the Winter Palace in Petersburg.
âª Kak Stranno âª
That means "How strange."
It tells such a sad, beautiful story about two people who meet and fall in love for one exquisite moment.
And then, they part.
Like ships that pass in the night.
âª Kak Stranno âª
How strange.
When will you teach me the code, Harry?
Oh, we'll get together soon.
Run over the fundamentals.
- Hi, Frank.
- Good evening, Mr. Van.
- Good evening, Ms. Irene.
- Hello.
Hello, Harry.
Hi, Ed.
Hi, Bert.
Well, good night, babe.
Oh...
- Do we have to say good night?
- Yes, we do.
I'm going to join the boys for a little political discussion.
All right, Harry.
- Good night.
- Good night.
And thanks for giving me such a good time.
Oh, thank you, Irene.
I always enjoy seeing a woman eating.
Don't forget now, brush your teeth carefully.
Tuck yourself in.
And have sweet dreams of old Russia.
How'd the show go tonight?
Oh, just as usual.
A sensation.
You can always wow 'em, Harry.
Yes, we got a very warm reception tonight.
In fact, I'm still burning.
Go for a little drink?
Bert here's got some pre-War rye.
Yeah.
Pre-the-next-war.
But it's all right, though.
I know the guy who made it.
No.
No, thanks, Bert.
I'm going to bed.
- I gotta think about my art.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
We know all about your art.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Thank you very much, sir.
It will be returned immediately.
Now, what is it?
What am I holding, Madame?
- A key.
- What kind of a key?
A key to a room.
- A man's room.
- Very good, Madame.
What else can you tell me about it?
Come.
Come, Madame.
Concentrate.
There are numbers on it.
- Magic, mystic numbers.
- Yes, yes.
I read in the Book of Fate, two-seven-four.
Very good, Madame!
Very good.
Thank you very much, sir.
Say, who gave you permission to wrap my best sock around your head?
When it comes to that, how did you get in here at all?
All the keys in this hotel fit all of the doors.
Oh, so you've been experimenting, huh?
Well, what do you want now?
- Please teach me the code, Harry.
- No!
I tell you, I could learn it.
I know I could!
I know part of it already.
When you were talking about Mr. MacCreevy's wife in the audience, and you said, "Now,"
that means the number is one.
"Can't" means two.
So that when you said, "Now, can't you concentrate,"
that was one-two, which is 12, and 12 is a vanity case.
And "Concentrate"--
Say, where did you find out all these things?
Well, I...
I just figured out by psychology.
Say, you're lying through those pretty teeth.
You've been snooping!
- Well, I--
- Where'd you get that code?
I suppose I might as well tell you.
Well, you'd better.
Oh, so you stole it, huh?
Say, don't you realize the American Society of Magicians could put thieves like you in jail?
Why, Harry, I only went into the dressing room to see Mr. Barzek, and I made friends with little Moppo, and the code was lying there, so I just...
Well, I just borrowed it.
Oh, please forgive me, Harry.
Can't you understand that I...
I just want to improve myself.
I want to be someone.
And if I could only work with you, be your partner, then I--
Sure.
You'd have your name up in lights in London.
"Assisted by Harry Van."
You're a funny kid at that.
I gotta admit it.
And maybe you're right.
Maybe you do deserve something better than just being an acrobat.
But unfortunately, I haven't the time to teach you the whole code.
However, I'll tell you what I'll do.
What, Harry?
I'll read you something out of the encyclopedia.
"This is the article about the subject of truth.
"Truth is the ideal of perfection for which all artists, scientists, and philosophers have striven.
The poet Keats wrote,
'Beauty is truth.
Truth, beauty.
That's all you know on Earth, and all you need to know.'
However, various philosophers, notably the early Greeks, have argued that..."
Watch yourself, miss.
Say, how much is this piece of junk?
75 cents.
75?
Six bits?
That's right.
Say, if that thing's worth more than a nickel, you're crazy.
I'm sorry, brother, I didn't write the prices.
I'm only here to repeat 'em.
Okay, pal.
I'll take the phoney thing.
Which proves I'm crazy, too.
You're right again.
Don't mention it.
Now, babe, it seems as though we have to say goodbye.
You're going north of Sioux Falls, and I'm heading south on the Interstate Time.
The trains pull out in a few minutes.
Do you think we'll ever see each other again, Harry?
Maybe we will, and maybe we won't.
You can't predict anything in show business.
Or in any other kind of a life, I suppose.
No, I guess not.
But I'll be thinking about you, babe.
Oh, I'm sure you will.
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
I'd like to know that you're thinking about me a little bit, too.
Well, I guess it's a mistake in show business to... to remember anything except the part you have to play.
Yup.
Well, even so,
I got you something.
What is it?
I don't know what it is.
You hang neckties on it, I guess.
It's a souvenir.
See, it says so.
"Souvenir of Omaha."
- Did you buy it for me, Harry?
- Yeah, certainly I did.
And what's more, it cost 75 cents.
You know, that's the most expensive present I ever bought for any dame.
What made you want to buy a present for me, Harry?
Oh, I don't know.
It's against my principles.
But you know, Irene,
I've met a lot of dames in my time, and most of 'em are so dumb you have to talk to 'em in sign language.
You're the only one I ever met that I couldn't answer.
Perhaps that's because I'm the only one who recognizes you for the great man that you are.
Hmm, great man, huh?
Great bust!
Tried everything and failed at everything.
But you don't see it that way, babe, because the world you live in isn't the world of facts and figures.
It's the world of dreams.
Maybe that's what I like about you, Irene.
You're so beautifully phoney.
And maybe you're wrong, my darling.
Maybe we two cheap people with our cheap lives...
Maybe we're the only ones in this crazy world who are real.
12:34 train for Sioux City!
Sioux Falls!
Well, we gotta be pulling out now, babe.
We gotta be pulling out now,
I know, but not together.
No, not together.
You go your way and I go mine.
But I got a hunch we'll see each other again, sometime.
Yes, yes.
- Goodbye, Harry.
- Goodbye, Irene.
And thanks for the souvenir.
All aboard!
All aboard!
Hello, Harry, dear.
Hello, Madame.
What?
Goodbye!
Goodbye, Irene!
What are they talking about, Harry?
How should I know?
But you're always saying you know the language.
The last time I said that was when we were in Romania.
That was six countries ago!
When are we gonna get to a decent place to sleep?
When we get to Geneva.
Excuse me, Countess.
Well, what's the trouble now?
Another frontier, I guess.
You know, that's my analysis of what's the trouble with Europe.
Too many frontiers.
They keep waking you up.
Skip it.
What did he say?
Harry?
I'll ask him.
So what's the good word, pal?
I guess we're supposed to get out here.
Come on, grab your baggage, girls.
Is this Geneva?
Does it look like Geneva?
I don't know.
Oh, Harry I'm so cold.
All right, all right!
I'm freezing to death!
- I am so glad to know you, Mr. and Mrs. Cherry.
- How do you do?
It was awfully kind of you to come down and meet us.
It was a pleasure, I assure you.
And I think I can promise that your stay at the Monta Loda Hotel will be a thoroughly enjoyable one.
Civilized people, at last!
Come on, girls, follow me.
The hotel porter is attending to your luggage.
- If you'll just step into the bus--
- Hey, listen, pal.
- Yes?
- You're an American, aren't you?
- I am.
Don Navadel's the name.
- Harry Van's mine.
- Well, Mr. Van, I sure am glad to know you.
- Glad to see you.
- Anything I can do for you?
- Yeah, we'd like to know what's the idea?
The idea?
Of what?
Kicking us off the train, pushing us around.
Say, are you all here, girls?
Wait a minute.
One, two, three, four, five... six.
Yes, Harry, we're all here.
We're entertainers.
Night clubs.
We're trying to get to Geneva, Switzerland.
Well, there's rather serious trouble just now here at this frontier.
Say, perhaps you and the young ladies would like to come up to our hotel for a little while until this situation has been cleared up?
Yeah, Harry, let's go to the hotel!
- Come on.
- We'd like to sleep in a bed for a change!
Oh, no, no, no.
We're not stopping at any hotel.
We gotta get to Geneva!
Hey, look, Harry!
Look what they're doing to our trunks!
Excuse me.
Wait here, girls.
Hey!
Hey!
Could you please be a little more careful with those trunks?
They contain the wardrobe of my act!
Yeah, I'll take vanilla.
Hey, listen, buddy, will you please tell me what I'm supposed to do with these trunks?
- Excuse me, my friend.
- Another white man in this jungle?
How do you do?
My name's Harry Van.
My name is Quillery.
I got six girls with me.
I'm in terrible trouble.
The whole world is in terrible trouble, Mr. Van.
Yeah.
Well, what are we all gonna do about it?
Who can tell?
But I just talked with one of the officials here.
He can speak a little French.
And he said that there are orders that no one is permitted across the frontiers.
But I must get back to my country.
I must get back to Italy!
I'm a German.
They have no right to deny me!
I shall make a protest to our embassy!
Say, there's an American here.
I think he's connected with the local hotel.
Let's go see him.
Maybe he can tell us something.
Oh, Harry, Mr. Navadel's been telling us all about the hotel.
They have winter sports here!
- Yeah, they have that skiing business.
- Skiing.
Never mind the winter sports!
But can't we go up there, Harry?
We're sick of the slats in those smelly day coaches.
These three gentlemen and I wanna know where can find the head man around here. Shut up!
Now, there must be somebody who can tell us when we do get across that border.
The commander of the frontier Post is Captain Kirvline.
- He's stopping at the hotel.
- Oh, let's go up and see him, Harry.
- Yeah, Harry.
Let's go up and get a drink.
- All right.
- What about the bagging?
- Our porter will attend to that.
Hey, portisto!
Here we are, folks.
Dumptsy, Otto, Chris, quick!
Take the luggage.
Say, this place is the berries.
Oh, we can have a swell time here.
After the way we've been betrayed in the Balkans, we can't afford to have a swell time any place.
This is our cocktail lounge.
Rather a magnificent view, isn't it?
Mmm, it's sweet.
What's that big bare patch down there?
It's an airport.
We have a great deal of flying around here.
- Oh, that's swell!
I love aviators!
- You do?
You know, this place looks to me like it's laying an egg.
- Laying a what?
- I mean, you aren't doing much business.
I don't see many customers around.
- This is between seasons.
- Oh.
You run this hotel?
I'm the social manager.
Hmm, a professional greeter, huh?
So, how'd you happen to get here?
I've been a specialist in resort hotel business all the way from Santa Barbara to Saint Moritz.
Perhaps the gentlemen and ladies would care to register now?
No, I'm not registering until I find out what's going on.
Come on, Harry, let's settle down.
We can go to Geneva some other time.
Relax, girls.
I'll attend to the bookings.
And you do not want rooms?
No, pal, I just came up for the view.
Evidently, Mr. Van, you're not fully aware of the present international situation.
Well, I'm aware that the international situation is always regrettable.
- What's wrong now?
-
- Haven't you been reading the papers?
In Bulgaria and Yugoslavia?
No.
- We're on the verge of a war.
- What?
Another one?
- When's that scheduled to begin?
- Any minute now.
And that's why they've closed every frontier in Europe.
Mr. Van, I advise you to be careful how you talk.
Why?
I'm an American citizen, I can say what I please.
Oh, there's Captain Kirvline now.
I tell you, I must go across that frontier.
I cannot delay!
I'm only obeying my orders, Dr. Waldersee.
I can't permit anyone to cross until--
But I must go into neutral territory to continue my experiments!
I'm a scientist, a servant of the whole stupid human race.
I'm working on a cure for cancer, the disease of civilization.
If I delay, my experiments are ruined!
Dr. Waldersee, I am deeply sorry, but I have no choice.
Hey, pal!
Captain Kirvline.
- Yes, Don?
- This is a fellow countryman of mine, Mr. Harry Van.
Will you please tell him that the train for Switzerland will not leave tonight?
Yes, Mr. Van, that's the unhappy fact.
Oh, but listen, Captain, I've got my passports.
All seven of 'em!
Look.
Oh, you're traveling with a large family.
Well, it isn't exactly a family.
There they are in there.
They're blondes.
Lovely girls they are, too, Captain.
And very intelligent.
- In fact, the mothers of tomorrow.
- Hmm?
Oh, uh, well...
That's the first good thing that's happened around here in years.
Hey, girls, come here.
I want you to meet the head man.
Captain Kirvline, this is Ms. Shirley Laughlin, owner of the rottenest voice on two continents.
- Charming.
- Hiya, Captain.
And Ms. Beulah Tremoyne.
Mmm, how do you do?
Beulah's our bubble dancer, and quite a dreamer.
Exquisite.
And next, Ms. Francine Merle, a daughter of the old South.
- Very alluring, eh, Captain?
- Magnificent.
- Thank you ever so much.
I--
- Uh, turn it off, honey.
And next, Ms. Edna Creesh.
She's as good as gold, and twice as tough.
Hiya, toots.
And next, Ms. Elaine Messiger.
I've heard she's a debutante, but she won't talk.
And next, Ms. Bebe Gould, a very, very lovely little number.
- Oh, Harry.
- Yeah.
Bebe's our hula artist.
Come on, kid.
Shake it for the captain.
Hold it, hold it.
Not at these prices.
That's very beautiful...
Well, Mr. Van, I congratulate you.
Oh, it's purely a business with me, Captain.
You see, we're an act.
Harry Van and Les Blondes, it's called.
- Oh, he's cute.
- Hmm, I'll say.
Now, we've got some very attractive bookings at a night spot in Geneva.
But we've got to be there by Thursday, or else we lose the time.
Mr. Van, under the circumstances, it's a pleasure for me to tell you that I cannot let you pass.
But perhaps, in the meantime, you would permit me to buy the young ladies a drink.
Well, all right, but only one apiece.
Oh, thanks, Captain!
We'd love it.
Do you have any more soldiers around here, Captain?
Thousands of 'em.
Well, I guess I might as well register.
I'll need three double rooms, two girls to a room.
And a single for me, adjoining.
I promised their mothers I'd always be within earshot.
What's that?
What is it?
Hey, hey!
What's all the excitement?
Is it a fire?
That's the warning from the airfield down there.
They're testing the combat planes in case of war.
They look pretty tough, don't they?
Yes.
They have the wings of death.
Maniacs.
Obscene maniacs.
All right, all right.
Finish your drinks and come on upstairs.
I'm gonna give you all a bath.
Now, listen to me, you dames.
You may as well know right now, the act is bankrupt.
I got barely enough to get us to Geneva.
So, don't run up any bills around this dump.
Say, Harry, there's a hairdresser here.
- Can't I get a finger wave?
- No!
Can we go skiing?
And risk breaking those pretty legs?
- Mmm, but it's healthy.
- Yeah, but you're not sick.
Those gams of yours are my bread and butter.
Now, remember, we get breakfast free here with our room rent, so eat plenty of that, but lay off on the other meals.
I'm going down to see if there's any more news.
And get off my bed!
Harry, see if there's a movie in town.
Harry, don't queer it for me with the captain.
Look, Mr. Van, they're bringing out the big planes.
They're full of bombs to drop on people.
They can fly from here to Rome, Berlin, or Paris, even all the way to London.
I like the looks of the mountains better.
You belong here in this country?
Well, yes, sir.
That is to say, I didn't used to.
That's my country over there.
You see, after the last war, they decided those mountains must be taken away from my country.
And I went with them.
In one day, I became a foreigner.
Even my old father, he's dead.
But all the writing on the gravestones, they rubbed it out and translated it.
So, now, he's a foreigner, too.
Excuse me, Mr. Van.
That fine car coming up the road must be rich people.
I'll be needed at the door.
Excuse me, please.
Good afternoon.
We have your reservation.
Oh, thank you.
Pardon me.
You're to be with us for a long stay, Madame?
Oh, no.
I'm afraid Mr. Weber must go on at once.
But I should love to stay here in these mountains.
They are so quiet, so cold and impersonal.
We have a marvelous view from here.
This is our cocktail lounge.
Oh, how very nice.
Vienne, Achille!
You must come and see this charming room!
In a moment, my dear.
And from our terrace, on a clear day, you can see for 50 miles.
It really is a view of unparalleled beauty.
Oh, magnificent!
All covered with the beautiful white snow.
I think the whole world should always be covered with snow.
It would be so much more clean, wouldn't it?
Like in my Russia.
White Russia.
You should see the snow from the terrace, Madame.
Oh, and how exciting!
A flying field.
Look, all those big bombers.
There are so many of them.
Isn't it miraculous?
Madame is interested in aviation?
Oh, no.
Just ordinary flying bores me.
But there is no experience in life quite so thrilling as a parachute jump, is there?
I never had that thrill, I'm ashamed to say.
Once, I had to jump when I was flying over the jungle in Indochina.
It was indescribable.
Drifting down, sinking into that great green sea of enchantment and hidden danger.
And you weren't afraid?
No, no.
In moments like that, one is given the sense of eternity.
Yes, sir?
Oh...
Get me a Scotch, and put ice in it.
If you haven't got any ice...
Go out and scoop up some of that beautiful white snow.
Uh, yes, sir.
But your place is really charming.
I must tell everyone in Paris about it.
We are rather proud of it.
There is something about this design.
It suggests, uh, an amusing kind of horror.
It is like somebody's tomb, isn't it?
- What's that?
- Oh, it's merely some kind of warning.
- They're testing it.
- Warning?
Warning against what?
I believe it's for use in case of war.
War?
But there will be no war.
Achille!
Yes, Irene?
Achille, there will be no war, will there?
No, there will be no war.
They're all much too well prepared.
Ah, there, you see?
They will not fight.
Mr. Weber says so, and he knows.
You wish to see your suite now, Mr. Weber?
- Yes, if you please.
- This way, please.
Achille, I'm mad about this place.
We must be sure to tell everyone about this place, Achille.
We must make it fashionable, at once.
Say, who is that?
That's Achille Weber, one of the biggest men in Europe.
I used to see him often at Saint Moritz.
No, no, no, no.
Who's the dame?
Well, I assume she's his wife.
Oh, you only assume it, huh?
Are you implying that she's not?
No, I'm not implying anything.
I'm just being kind of bewildered.
Evidently.
"White Russia."
"Parachute jumper."
- Put it down there.
- Very good, sir.
Thanks, pal.
Hold on.
Mineral water.
Jawohl, Herr Doktor.
It's an old museum piece, period of Louis XV.
You gotta hoard your gum over here.
What is that you're playing?
It's an old Russian song entitled Kak Stranno, meaning "How strange."
One of those morose ballads about how once we met for one immortal moment, like ships that pass in the night.
Or maybe like a couple of trucks sideswiping each other.
And now, I got a hunch we meet again.
How strange.
I'm afraid I was rude to you before.
Oh, that's all right, pal.
I've been rude to lots of people and never regretted it.
There's no reason why you should worry about a punk like me.
You've got important work to do for the benefit of humanity.
You, too, work for humanity, Mr. Van.
- Me?
- Yes, you're a musician.
Yeah, that's a nice name for it.
You know, I used to play piano in picture theatres, but that was the only sound they had, except for peanuts.
Uh, listen to this.
The Waters of the Minnetonka.
Suitable for scenics, Niagara Falls by moonlight.
Or if you play it like this...
Goes fine with a scene where the young Indian chief turns out to be a Yale man.
You know, I've turned my hand to about everything, including your line of business.
- My business?
- Yeah!
Dr. Multee's Elixir, the miracle remedy!
A remedy for what, may I ask?
Oh, it was a cure for almost everything.
All my life, I've been selling phoney goods to people of meager intelligence and great faith.
Hey, Harry, have those officers come up here yet?
Not yet.
Don't be discouraged!
Sit down!
I'm feeling in a generous mood.
- I'm gonna buy you all a drink.
- What?
I hardly think you need bother about jewelry in this place.
Only my bracelets, Achille.
Because you like them.
Oh, but, my dear, there's certainly nobody else in this dismal hotel who can appreciate your charms.
We'll have dinner in there.
Did you get your telephone call?
Yes, I spoke to Felvero.
He was very apologetic over this delay.
But everything is arranged for us to proceed tomorrow.
Oh.
I think I shall go downstairs and have a glass of vodka.
But why, my dear?
We can have it sent up here.
No, Achille.
I would prefer to have it down there.
With all those dreadful people gaping at you?
I don't mind.
I love people.
I shall come right back.
I'll go with you.
It may be amusing.
Good afternoon, Madame.
Good afternoon, Mr. Weber.
Good afternoon, Mr. Navadel.
It is a lovely view!
It is like a landscape on the moon.
Dumptsy!
Get a load of that.
Isn't she gorgeous?
I bet she's a duchess.
Well, anyway a princess.
Hey, Harry, what are you looking at?
She looks to me like a phoney.
Hiya, Cap!
Good afternoon, ladies.
Where's all your boyfriends, Cap?
Oh, excuse me a moment, please.
Mr. Weber.
Madame.
Captain Kirvline, commandant of the frontier station.
- How do you do?
- Captain?
I've just received instructions that you're here, Mr. Weber.
I am to be of assistance to you in every possible way.
Thank you very much.
Won't you join us?
Thank you, sir.
- What would you like?
- Brandy and soda, please.
Irene?
- Vodka, if you please.
- Vermouth for me.
If you please, sir.
Where are they going, Achille?
Probably moving to another airbase farther from the frontier.
Isn't that so, Captain?
Hmm?
Uh, yes, I imagine so.
Say, are they gonna keep that up forever?
You're gonna have to get us some earmuffs, Harry.
Hello, Mr. Quillery.
Sit down and have one.
I'm buying.
Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow, we starve...
Except for breakfast.
I just heard some very ugly rumors down in the town.
They say that war has already been declared.
Rumors.
Rumors.
Everything's rumors!
When are we going to know?
Soon enough, heaven help us.
But we'll stop this war.
We'll save the human race from plunging into mass murder, mass suicide.
Say, what's your line of business, Mr. Quillery?
I'm a preacher, Mr. Van.
You don't say so.
A preacher, huh?
But not in the church.
I used to be a worker in an industry that made poison gas.
Gave me ideas.
Since then, I've gone about the world preaching the message of peace.
The brotherhood of man.
Well, I think you've got a great idea there, pal.
Stick to it.
Attention!
Did you hear what they were saying?
Yeah, I heard, but I couldn't understand.
About the war!
I believe they're saying it's already been declared.
I must go on demand that they let me across the border at once.
That's right, pal.
You're gonna save the world.
You've got no time to lose.
Say, Harry, what's it all about?
I'll tell you later.
- Hey, Don.
- Yes?
Step up the music, will you?
Some of us young people wanna dance.
Sure.
Come on, boys.
Give us a tune with a lot of oomph.
Come on, babe.
Nothing from Berlin except Wagner.
Try Paris.
Perhaps we can get some news from there.
There, that's one Paris station.
Silent.
I'll try another.
Silent.
Try ten-sixteen, Captain Kirvline.
- That's also Paris.
- Thank you.
Probably code messages from the Ministry of War to the army.
If we could only read them.
Seems to me, everybody'd be much happier in Europe if they only knew how to make decent coffee.
There, that's a station in Prague.
Do you understand any of that, Achille?
No, not a word.
Neither do I.
Then I suggest you try London.
And now, to conclude our news program, we shall give you the results of the day's more important football matches.
Sheffield United two, Birmingham one.
England is England, still.
I'll try and get through.
Will the wires be open, Captain?
Yes, I'll try to arrange it, Mr. Weber.
Irene.
- I'll be up presently, Achille.
- Madame.
You look unhappy, Mr. and Mrs. Cherry.
I'm afraid so, but it's difficult to be cheerful under these circumstances, isn't it?
Oh, you must forget the circumstances.
Come here and drink some vodka with me.
We'd love to.
I've never tasted vodka before.
Oh!
Then it is high time!
And your friend.
I do not know his name.
Oh, Mr. Van.
May I present Madame...
Madame...
How do you do?
Glad to make your acquaintance, Madame.
You will join us in a glass of vodka?
Thank you.
- Three glasses.
Auguste!
- Yes, Madame.
Please sit down, Mr. Van.
I know why you're depressed, Mrs. Cherry.
It is the altitude.
After the first exhilaration, there comes a depressive reaction.
Especially for you, who are accustomed to the heavy, Pigwiggian atmosphere of England.
Pigwiggian?
Yes, Pigwig.
Oliver Twist.
You know, your Dickens.
You know England, Madame?
Of course, I know England.
My governess was a sweet old ogre from your North country.
And when I was a little girl,
I used to visit often at Sandringham.
Sandringham?
Yes.
Oh, but that was before your time.
It was in the reign of dear gay King Edward and the beautiful Alexandra.
I used to have such fun playing with my cousin David.
He used to try to teach me to play cricket.
And when I couldn't swing the bat properly, he said, "Oh, you Russians will never be civilized!"
And when I went home to Petersburg,
I told to my uncle what David had said, and he was so amused.
But now, we must drink our vodka.
With your permission.
I drink to his most gracious majesty, the King.
And the president of your United States.
- Thanks.
I'm sure he'll appreciate that.
- Now...
No, no!
You must drink it right down.
Like this.
So, there, you see?
The second glass will go more easily.
I hope so.
You are not married for a long time?
We were married the day before yesterday.
No!
Oh, how thrilling!
Let me offer my congratulations.
Thank you very much.
You see, I've been studying painting there, and we both love Italy. We were married in Florence.
How wonderful.
Florence is the most perfect place to be married in.
Don't you think so, Mr. Van?
Well, I guess any place is perfect for that purpose.
Oh, no!
Not your America.
Too dull.
Too much business.
Not enough romance.
You've, uh, been in America?
Oh, yes.
I have seen it all.
New York, Washington, Palm Beach.
No, no!
I, uh, said America.
Have you ever been in the West?
Certainly, I have.
I flew across your continent!
Did you ever make any parachute landings in any places like, uh...
Kansas or Iowa?
Or Nebraska?
No.
On that flight,
I had no parachute.
You like the vodka now?
Oh, it feels marvelous, in here.
Ah-ha!
I used to laugh so at your funny British Tommies in Arkhangelsk.
They all hated vodka, until one of them thought of mixing it with beer.
- How awful!
- Oh, it was!
But I shall be forever grateful to them, those Tommies.
They saved my life when I escaped from the Soviets.
For days and nights, I don't know how many,
I was driving through the snow, snow, snow, snow, snow, in a little sleigh, with the dead body of my father beside me.
I was in agony from the bayonet wounds of the Bolsheviki.
And the wolves were running along like an escort of dragoons.
You must have been dreadfully afraid.
Oh, no.
I was not afraid for myself.
It was the thought of my father.
Oh, please.
I know you don't want to talk about it anymore.
Oh, no, it is so far away now.
But I shall never forget the moment when I came through the haze of delirium and saw the faces of those Tommies.
Those simple, friendly faces.
And the snow, and the wolves, and the terrible cold, they were all gone!
And I was looking at Kew Gardens.
It was a Sunday afternoon, and a sea of gold and daffodils fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
In the face of real danger, one forgets to be afraid.
Don't you think so, Mr. Van?
I don't know.
I was scared stiff once.
It was when I was working with a mind-reading act.
Really?
You mean, you read people's minds?
Sure.
I could see right through 'em.
Oh, how embarrassing!
I was playing a week in Omaha.
Have you ever been in Omaha, Madame?
Omaha?
Omaha?
Where is that?
Persia?
- It's in Nebraska.
That's one of our states.
- Oh.
If you please, Madame, Mr. Weber would like to see you, if convenient.
Thank you, Dumptsy.
You must tell me later about that mind-reading, Mr. Van.
Whenever you're free.
And do finish the vodka.
All of it!
- Oh, thank you very much, Madame.
- It will help you both so much.
She's an amazing woman, isn't she?
"Amazing" is a feeble word for it.
Well, did you get 'em to call off the war?
I only learned that, when the borders are open, we will be notified.
Is there any news?
Not in this patriotic journal.
Unconfirmed reports from Vienna, London, Rome, Berlin, Moscow, Tokyo.
And a lot of confirmed lies from the local censored press.
If you want to know what is really happening, you must ask the great Mr. Achille Weber upstairs there.
He can give you all the war news, because he made it.
You don't know who the great Mr. Achille Weber is, do you?
Well, I'll tell you.
He's been organizing the arms industry.
Munitions for murder.
In every part of the world, the good desires of men for peace and decency is undermined by the dynamite of jingoism.
So it takes only a spark, set off anywhere, to send it up into one fatal explosion.
Then, love becomes hatred, courage becomes terror, and hope becomes despair.
And that's very nice for Mr. Achille Weber, because he is master of the one real League of Nations,
- the League of the Merchants of Death!
- Nonsense.
- Who speaks?
- I speak!
The eminent Dr. Hugo Waldersee.
And if you love your country so much, why aren't you there now with your rats?
I am not concerned with politics.
I'm a scientist.
- Mineral water.
- That's right, Herr Doctor.
You are a scientist.
And a servant of the people.
And yet, you know that if you were in your own country, you would have to abandon your cure for cancer.
It might benefit too many people.
Your duty would be not to cure, but to kill.
You, a fighter against disease and death would be a Judas goat in a slaughterhouse.
I say, Quillery, do we have to have so much talk about blood
- just before dinner?
- Just before dinner?
That's all you worry about!
What do you care that civilization is falling to pieces as long as you have your dinner and your dinner jacket?
I'm sorry, Quillery, I think we'd better conclude this discussion
- out on the terrace!
-
- Jimmy, don't be a fool!
- You'll gain nothing by thrashing him.
- I'm at your disposal.
- You can't conduct yourself as a gentleman.
- Now, listen, folks.
There's no reason for any heat under the cutter.
We're all buddies here.
Mr. Van is right.
There's no reason for any heat.
My apologies, Mr. Cherry.
Oh, that's all right, old man.
- Come and have a drink.
- No, thank you.
My apologies to you, too, Herr Doctor.
I ask for no apologizing.
If I let my speech run away with me, it's because I have hatred for certain things.
You should hate them, too.
They are the things that make us blind, and ignorant, and dirty.
How would it be if I and the girls put on part of our act here tonight?
For the purpose of the wholesome merriment, and relieving the general tension.
What kind of an act is it?
Don't say "What kind of an act is it" in that tone of voice!
It's good enough for this place.
We'll omit the bubble dance, but I can have Bebe do her hula number if there's a special request for it.
Do you expect to get paid for this?
Certainly not.
I'm offering this out of the goodness of my heart.
Of course, if you care to make any appropriate adjustments on the hotel bill...
All right, Mr. Van, if you think you can entertain us.
- I'll get the girls ready.
- What time do you want the show to go on?
After we eat.
Yes.
Yes!
They what?
Just as I thought, those bombers have gone off on an air raid.
The one mad-dog act of violence all Europe has been fearing.
Then, the next war has started, Achille?
With a vengeance.
But I thought you said they will not fight.
No one could predict what they would do in their desperation!
We must get out of here quickly.
I must send some telegrams.
It'll soon be found out that some of the bombers came from this air base.
Tomorrow night, they'll come over here for revenge.
That will be exciting to see!
- What, an air raid?
- Yes!
With bombs bursting in the snow, sending up great geysers of diamonds.
Great geysers of us, perhaps.
Oh, no, my dear, we leave at once for Biarritz.
It's healthier there.
I can imagine how thrilling it must be in Paris at this moment.
Just like 1914.
All the lovely soldiers singing, marching, marching!
Oh, I am so happy for you, Achille!
What, my dear?
I said, I am so happy for you.
Happy?
Why?
All this wonderful death and destruction everywhere, and you promoted it.
You have a superb imagination, my dear.
It's the quality in you that fascinates me most.
It is what has made you such a brilliant and admirable liar, and so very helpful to me.
Am I right?
Of course, you're right, Achille.
Had I been bound by any stuffy respect for the truth,
I'm sure of it.
Did I ever tell you of my escape from the Soviets?
You've told me about it at least 11 times, and every time it was different.
Well, I made several escapes.
I am always making escapes, Achille.
When I'm worrying about you and your career,
I have to run away from the terror of my own thoughts.
So, I amuse myself by studying the faces of the people I see.
Just ordinary, casual, dull people.
That little English couple, for instance.
I was watching them during dinner, sitting there, close together, holding hands.
And I saw him in his nice, smart British uniform, shooting a little pistol at a huge tank.
And the tank rolls over him.
And his fine, strong body that was so full of the capacity for ecstasy is a mass of mashed flesh and bones, a smear of purple blood, like a stepped on snail.
But before the moment of death, he consoles himself by thinking,
She is bearing the child I gave her.
And he will live to see a better world."
But I know where she is.
She is under a house that has been wrecked by an air raid.
She is as dead as he is.
But he died in action against the enemy gloriously.
But she died in a cellar, not so very gloriously.
There will be many who will die that way in this war, won't there, Achille?
You don't say anything.
Probably, you are bored.
But I like to think about these things, Achille.
And it makes me so proud to think that I am so close to you, who makes all this possible.
That's all very interesting, my dear.
But before you waste too much sympathy on these little people, like your English friends, just ask yourself this, "Why shouldn't they die?"
And who are the greater criminals, those who sell the instruments of death, or those who buy them and use them?
It is they who make war seem noble and heroic.
And what does it all amount to?
Mistrust of the motives of everyone else.
A dog in the manger defense of all they've got.
Greed for the other fellow's possessions!
I assure you, Irene, for such little people, the deadliest weapons are the most merciful.
Quiet!
Quiet!
Ladies and gentlemen, quiet, please!
Thank you so much.
The management of the Hotel Monta Loda has the privilege and the pleasure of presenting for your entertainment tonight a troupe of outstanding American artists who have lately been touring Europe, scoring notable triumphs in Monte Carlo and other centers of gaiety.
I know that you will join with us in giving a really rousing, rip-roaring reception to Harry Van and Les Blondes!
Mr. Van.
Hello, people.
And thanks, Don, for that very, very lovely introduction you gave us.
All I can say is, thanks a million, and I won't settle for a cent less.
Now, in our modest act tonight, we'll be ably assisted by Professor Palota and his talented little team.
Give him a hand, folks!
Please remember, we haven't had much time for rehearsal, so I crave your indulgence if the rhythm isn't all strictly kosher.
Thanks for that laugh, pal.
Thank you very much indeed.
All I ask of you is that "Christian pearl of charity,"
to quote our great American poet, John Greenleaf Whittier.
Give him a hand, folks!
Okey-doke, professor, take it away!
This will be amusing, Achille.
I hope so.

Good evening, Captain.
I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Van, to interrupt your entertainment like this, but... after your charming young ladies have finished,
I wondered, do you think they could be persuaded to have a drink with my comrades?
Yes.
Yes, I think they could.
Tell the boys to sit down.
After this next number, girls, you can join the army.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen!
Our next number will be a stellar presentation by Miss Bebe Gould, entitled Shame on You.
Hit it again, maestro!
âª Shame on you You loveless lover âª âª I rate tops Till you discover âª âª Someone making eyes âª âª Then taking you Right out of my poor arms âª
âª Shame on you It isn't funny âª
- Have you heard the news?
- No!
What's happened?
There's been an air raid!
A terrible air raid!
There's entertainment going on here.
Entertainment?
While tens of thousands of innocent people are dead or dying?
Entertainment?
Mr. Quillery, please!
If you cannot keep quiet, we must ask you to leave!
Keep it up, girls.
Keep it up!
Where did this happen?
Tonight, they dropped 50,000 kilos of terrible death.
Please, this is no time for a news bulletin.
- Tonight, their planes flew over--
- How do you know?
It's on the wireless everywhere.
And I just talked to one of the mechanics.
The planes from that very field down there.
Sit down, will you, pal?
We're trying to give you a little entertainment!
While you sit here eating and drinking, airplanes dropped 50,000 kilos of bombs on innocent people.
Heaven knows how many were killed.
How much of life and beauty is forever destroyed.
And you sit here eating and drinking with them, the murderers!
They did it!
It was their planes from that very field down there.
Assassins!
Here, here!
We can't have any skull-cracking in this club.
Captain, speak to your men before they start something.
- I'll take charge.
- I'm with you, Quillery.
- Jimmy, you keep out of this!
- I say curse you, assassins!
Now, listen, pal.
Harry, don't get yourself mixed up in this mess.
- We stand together.
- It's all right, Captain.
I can handle this.
Now, stop shooting off your face!
I say curse you and curse the villains that sent you on this errand of death!
Mr. Quillery, if you don't shut your mouth, I'll be forced to arrest you.
Go on, you toy soldiers, commit national suicide.
It's the last gesture left to you.
It's all right, Captain.
Quillery is for peace.
He's going home to stop the war.
Oh, you're not authorized to speak for me!
I'm competent to say what I feel.
And what I say is, "He that taketh up the sword shall die by the sword!"
And you, too, shall die, murderers!
Mr. Quillery, you're under arrest.
Go on, call out the firing squad!
Shoot me dead!
But don't think you can silence the truth that's in me!
Down with you, dirty murderers!
Shoot me!
Go on, shoot me!
Excuse me, my dear.
Some important business.
I'll leave you with your charming friends.
You better carry on with your turn, old man.
No, no, no. the act is cold.
Hey, maestro, give us some dance music!
Let dancing become general!
Will you dance with me?
Why, yes.
I should love it.
My father was old.
The hardships of that terrible journey had broken his body.
But his spirit was strong.
The spirit that is Russia.
He lay there in that little boat and he looked up at me.
Never can I forget his face.
So thin, so white, so beautiful in the starlight.
He said to me, "Irene, little daughter."
And then, he died.
For four days, I was alone with his body, sailing through the storms of the Black Sea.
I had no food, no water.
I was in agony from the bayonet wounds of the Bolsheviki.
I knew I must die.
But then, an American cruiser rescued me.
May heaven bless those good men.
Excuse me, Madame.
But it seems to me the last time you told me about your escape, it was different.
Well, I made several escapes.
But I have talked too much about myself.
What about you, my friend?
Oh, I'm not very interesting.
- I'm just what I seem to be.
- Really?
Why do you waste yourself in this degraded work?
You mean you think I'm fitted for something that requires more mentality?
- Of course.
- How do you know so much about me?
For one thing, I saw your performance tonight.
You thought it was rotten?
I thought it was unworthy.
Unfortunately, it was interrupted.
I saw enough.
You are a very bad dancer.
Hmm.
In Romania, they thought I was pretty good.
Do you know that you can be extremely rude?
Me?
How?
Why do you stare at me so?
- Was I staring?
- Steadily.
Ever since I arrived here this morning.
Why do you do it?
Well, I thought I detected a funny kind of resemblance to somebody I used to know.
You should know better than to tell any woman that she resembles someone else.
We none of us like to think that our appearance is commonplace.
The one you look like wasn't commonplace.
Oh!
She was someone near and dear to you?
She occupies a unique shrine in the temple of my memory.
Really?
That is a glowing review!
The temple of your memory must be so crowded.
Are you sure you've never been in Omaha, Madame?
Omaha.
Oh, yes!
That is where you said you did what?
- What... what... what was it?
- Mind-reading.
Oh, of course.
No.
I'm afraid I do not know your Omaha.
But I have seen enough of your countrymen to know that you are typical.
I'm not typical of anything.
Oh, yes, you are.
You are an ingenious sentimental idealist.
You believe in the goodness of human nature, don't you?
You can call that sentimental, Mrs. Weber, but it's true.
Forgive me, but that is not my name.
- Oh.
Well, I thought--
- I know what you thought.
Mr. Weber and I are associated in a sort of business way.
I see.
The business is pretty good, isn't it?
But it is getting late, and I'm keeping you from your duties.
I haven't got any duties.
Hello, Harry.
How're we doing?
Shouldn't you be worrying about your young ladies?
I thought you were supposed to be the chaperone.
I leave the girls to their own resources, of which they have plenty.
Now you are staring at me again.
I was just thinking, you said you were interested in aviation.
So was the girl I knew in Omaha.
She swung from the tail of a tin airplane by her teeth.
What an extraordinary way to make a living.
Excuse me.
Were you always a blonde?
Why, yes.
As far back as I can remember.
Was that other one, the one that I remind you of, was she blonde?
She had red hair, but I suspected even that.
Tell me, what was she like?
She said she was a graduate of the University of Vienna.
And she was the fanciest liar I ever knew.
She sounds fascinating.
She was a pest.
One night, she broke up the mind-reading act.
And then, she had the nerve to ask me to teach her the code.
I had a terrible time getting rid of her.
She even forced her way into my room at the hotel!
Dear!
I hope you didn't teach her the code.
But I really must go now.
Uh...
Do you know any Russian songs?
Oh, yes!
When I was a little girl, my father used to engage Chaliapin to come often to our house.
He taught me many songs.
Hmm, Chaliapin, huh?
You father spared no expense.
That was in old Russia.
Do you know this one?
Oh!
Kak Stranno!
How's strange.
How strange.
What did you say your name was?
Irene!
- How do you spell it?
- I-R-E-N-E.
That's it!
Irene!
But what?
I knew it!
You're the one!
- What one?
- The redheaded liar, Irene!
I knew I couldn't be mistaken!
Oh, there are so many by that name.
Not like you, babe.
Everything fits.
The name, the face, the voice!
- Chaliapin for a teacher!
- Old Russia!
Certainly, it's you!
And there's no use shaking your head and looking amazed.
No matter how much you lie, you can't wipe out the memory of the Royal Grand Hotel in Omaha.
The what hotel?
All right.
Go ahead and laugh.
That blonde hair had me fooled for a minute, but it's just as phoney as that parachute jump into the jungle.
Oh, you amuse me!
It's a pleasure to be entertaining, but you can't get away with it.
You amuse me very much indeed.
Here we are on a mountain peak in Bedlam.
Tonight, war is breaking over the world.
And all you worry about is whether I am a girl you once met casually in Omaha-ha-ha.
Did I say it was casual?
- Oh, it is amusing.
- Sure, it is.
It's absolutely side-splitting.
But don't think for one minute there's any more doubt in my mind.
I've got you tagged!
Good night, my friend.
My funny friend.
Good night.
And thank you for making me laugh so much tonight.
And what did you say was the name of that hotel?
The Royal Grand!
Oh, yes!
The Royal Grand.
You may recall it had one of those old air-conditioned elevators, just like this one.
The Royal Grand.
The Royal Grand!
Say, whose are these?
Well, they're not mine.
- I wear opera length.
- Skip it.
They're mine.
Thanks, Harry, dear.
I couldn't believe we were leaving a place without one of you overlooking something.
Now we're going to Geneva, girls.
It's a very important city, and we've gotta make good.
If we click there, we're all set for London and Paris.
Maybe we'll make enough money to get us home.
Oh, don't speak of such a thing.
Home!
To get a real decent henna rinse again.
I reached a decision last night about the act.
What is it, Harry?
From now on, I do no more dancing.
- Why?
- What?
Well, we've gotta have you in the routines, Harry.
I've decided that hoofing hurts me.
It's undignified!
From now on, I devote myself to the more intellectual side of the act.
And of course, the negotiations of contracts.
What made you decide that, Harry?
I'm a thinker, not a performer.
Say, what were you talking about to that Russian number?
We discussed world conditions.
Oh, and how are world conditions?
Hello, girls.
I just wanna tell you, the orders have come through.
The frontier bridge will be open at five o'clock.
We'll all be allowed to pass.
- You going too, Don?
- I certainly am.
- But you got a swell job here.
- Say, this place is finished.
They know where those planes came from last night.
And the same thing will happen here.
Boom, boom!
So it's California, here I come.
And run right into the Japs.
You better stop off in Oklahoma City.
I'm going down to see about the passports.
Oh, Harry, can't we go, too?
I'm afraid.
No, wait here till I call you.
- Mr. and Mrs. Cherry, there you are.
- Thank you, Captain.
You're leaving, Mrs. Cherry?
Our country is coming into this business, and so there's nothing for it, but...
- So, the honeymoon is over, huh?
- Yes.
Jimmy feels he has to do his bit.
Don't worry, darling.
The war will be over before I even get into uniform.
That's what they said in 1914.
Goodbye, Captain.
Goodbye and...
Good luck and happiness to both of you.
Thank you, Captain.
Come, my sweet.
See you on the bus, Mr. Van.
Certainly.
Frankly, Captain, my heart bleeds for them.
They come up here to spend their honeymoon on skis, and now they have to go back and fight to make the world safe for democracy... again.
Yes.
It is a tragedy.
Mr. Van.
Here are your passports, with my compliments.
- You'll find them duly stamped.
- Thank you, Captain.
How about Mr. Weber and the Madame?
Are they leaving, too?
Oh, yes, yes.
I have their passports right here.
Uh, if I may advise you, Mr. Van, better make ready.
The train will be leaving in about 45 minutes.
Okay, Captain.
I'll see you about the trunks.
Is everything in order?
Quite, Mr. Weber.
Here it is.
- Well, thank you.
And Madame's?
- Oh, Mr. Weber, this is...
This is an unusual kind of passport.
It's, uh...
It's given us quite some worry.
Well, uh, she was born in Russia, so she says.
But ever since she was a child, she's been wandering around the world belonging to no country.
I secured this passport for her from the League of Nations.
I see.
Well, since Madame is traveling with you,
I'll be glad to approve her visa.
But Madame is not traveling with me.
Well...
Wasn't it understood that you vouch for her?
No one need vouch for Madame.
She's quite capable of taking care of herself.
If her passport is not in order, that's no affair of mine.
Uh, Mr. Weber, you...
You put me in a very embarrassing position.
I'll be forced to detain her.
You are a soldier, my dear captain, and you should be used to being placed in embarrassing positions.
No doubt you were very embarrassed when you had to shoot that confused little pacifist, Quillery, huh?
This is war, Captain, and...
Thank you.
I'll look after my luggage.
- Do you have my passport visa?
- Yes, Dr. Waldersee.
Hi, Doctor.
Did you get your rats packed?
- Ja.
- There you are.
I can tell you, Doctor, I'm going to be proud to have known you.
When I read in the papers that you wiped out cancer and won the Nobel Prize, and you're the greatest hero in the world,
He once admired my music."
Thank you very much.
This visa is good for crossing all borders?
Yes, certainly, Doctor.
But you're going to Zurich, aren't you?
I have changed my plans.
I'm going back to my home.
We are at war.
Maybe I shall be needed.
Needed for what?
I shall offer my services for what they are worth.
Oh, but what about your rats?
Why should I save people who don't want to be saved?
So they can go out and exterminate each other?
As for my rats... maybe they will be useful.
There will be another blockade of my country and we will be starving.
Maybe I will cut my rats into filets and eat them.
Oh, wait a minute, Doctor.
You're not thinking what you're doing.
I'm thinking that probably the remedy you sold is better than mine.
Hasten to apply it.
We are all diseased.
I'm sorry to disappoint you about the Nobel Prize.
- Goodbye, Doctor.
- Adieu.
Good luck.
Why can't somebody answer the question that everybody's asking?
Oh, I know the obvious answers, but that's not good enough.
Weber and a million like him can't take the credit for all of this.
Who is it that does a dirty trick like this to a lot of decent people?
And why do you let them get away with it, that's what I'd like to know.
My friend, we have avalanches up here.
They're disastrous.
They start with a tiny little crack in the ice, so small, one can't even see it.
Until suddenly, it bursts wide open and then it's too late.
That's a very slick explanation, Captain, but it doesn't satisfy me.
Because this avalanche isn't made of ice.
It's made of flesh and blood and brains.
Yes, I know.
Still upset about the situation, Mr. Van?
Oh, good afternoon, my dear Captain Kirvline.
Good afternoon, Madame.
I have had the most superb rest here.
The atmosphere is so calm, so soothing.
I can't bear to think that we are going to Biarritz, with the dull, dismal old sea pounding in my ears.
We are leaving now, Achille?
I believe some difficulties have arisen.
- Difficulties?
- Yes, Madame.
Madame, this passport of yours presents certain problems--
Mr. Weber will settle the problems, whatever they are.
Won't you, Achille?
Well, there seems to be some question about your nationality.
Yes, it states here that your birthplace is uncertain, but assumed to be Armenia.
I have never before had the slightest difficulty about my passport.
It was issued by the League of Nations!
Madame, the fact is that circumstances over which I have no control compel me to deny your permission to cross the frontier at this time.
I'm sure you'll appreciate the delicacy of my position.
Perhaps we'll be able to adjust this matter tomorrow.
Madame.
I should stay over, of course, my dear.
But you know how dangerous that would be, even if I delayed my return for even so much as one day.
I've been in touch with our agents, and the War Ministry is demanding the production of all munitions be doubled, trebled, at once.
Of course.
I'm sure that this will take care of all necessary expenses.
And I don't think you'll be inconvenienced very long.
I suggest you go toward the east.
Athens, possibly.
There's no danger there.
Thank you, Achille.
Thank you for having managed this so very, very tactfully.
You are a genuinely superior person, my dear.
It is a privilege to have known you.
Thank you again, Achille.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Irene.
- Tough luck, babe.
- It's no matter.
I talked to the captain.
He can't explain what went wrong.
But you can trust him.
He won't be as brutal as the Bolsheviki were.
I mean, you won't suffer any bayonet wounds.
You see that you get through tomorrow.
You want to be encouraging, my friend, but it is no use.
- Hey, Harry, it's time to go.
- Yeah, I'll be right there.
Go away.
Go away with your friends.
If I am to remain here, it is no concern of yours.
Listen, babe, I haven't any wish to--
Please don't call me "babe."
Even if I don't believe anything you say,
I can see pretty plainly that you're in a tough spot.
Considering our friendship back at the Royal Grand Hotel--
Must you always be in Omaha?
I want to help you, Irene.
Isn't there something I can do?
You are very kind, and very gallant.
But unfortunately, you are no match for Achille Weber.
He has decided that I shall remain here.
- And his decision is final.
- Harry, come on out!
What's he got against you?
He's afraid of me.
I know too much about his methods of promoting his own business.
Well, everybody knows about his methods.
Little Quillery was talking about them last night.
Yes, and what happened to Quillery?
That's what happens to everyone who dares to criticize him.
Last night, I did the one thing he could never forgive.
I told him the truth!
At last, I told him just what I think!
And now you see how quickly he strikes back.
Harry!
Come on!
Harry, the bus is gonna leave!
All right, all right.
But we gotta go this minute!
I'll be right there.
Get out!
How do you like that?
He stops everything to make another pass with that Russian.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
You can't help me.
No one can.
Harry!
But...
If it will make you any happier in your future travels with Les Blondes,
I will tell you...
Yes, I did know you slightly in Omaha.
So you decided to break down and admit it at last.
I can't believe it.
Perhaps you're lying again.
It was room 274.
Does that convince you?
How can I remember what room it was?
Well, then you will never be sure, Mr. Van.
- Harry!
- We can't wait another instant!
- They're gonna go off without us!
- We'll get stuck here!
Harry, you're letting down the act!
Goodbye, Harry.
Goodbye again.
- Oh, Harry.
Come on!
- Come on!
Let's go.
All right.
- Bye bye.
- Come on.
Goodbye.
Goodbye!
- Bye!
- Goodbye!
Goodbye.
Why, Dumptsy!
Good afternoon, Madame.
What is that costume?
They called me up.
Look, I'm a soldier.
You look splendid.
If you please, Madame, but why didn't you go on that bus?
Oh, I have decided to stay here and enjoy the winter sports.
Oh, this isn't a good place anymore, Madame.
They say the war is very big.
Bigger than the last time.
The enemy will be over here with the bombs!
It will be thrilling for us if they do, Dumptsy.
Maybe it will, Madame.
But I came to say goodbye to Auguste, the barman.
He's a cousin of mine.
He will laugh when he sees me in these clothes.
Oh, yes.
Thank you, Madame.
Dumptsy, bring bottle of champagne and two glasses.
- We'll have drink together.
- If you please, Madame.
Your luggage is in the hall, Madame.
Will you wish it taken to the same suite?
No, thank you.
Have you anything smaller?
Smaller?
Yes.
We have smaller rooms on the other side of the hotel.
I will have the smallest.
It will be cozier.
Wish to go to it now?
No, thank you.
You can send up the luggage.
I will look at it later.
Very well.
I was right, Madame.
Auguste laughed very much.
I'm glad.
You will enjoy being a soldier, Dumptsy?
Oh, yes, Madame.
If I'm taken prisoner soon enough.
Go ahead and pour yourself one.
Oh, thank you so much, Madame.
I wasn't sure I heard you correctly.
Here's to you, Dumptsy.
And to you, Madame, if you please.
Thank you.
And who do you think will win this war, Dumptsy?
Oh, I know nothing of that, Madame, except it will be like the last time.
Whoever wins, my country will lose.
They will all lose, Dumptsy.
If you please, Madame.
Now, I must go, if you will excuse me.
Dumptsy.
Here's for you.
Goodbye and God bless you.
Thank you so much, Madame.
Did you have some trouble?
No.
- Whose is that champagne?
- Mine.
But won't you have some?
Thanks.
- Dumptsy used that glass.
- That's all right.
What happened?
Didn't you get across the border?
The girls did.
There was a train waiting on the other side.
Mr. and Mrs. Cherry promised to look out for 'em.
They'll be okay.
And you came back to me?
Well, it seems fairly obvious that I did come back.
You meant it when you said that you wanted to help me.
You said I'd never be sure.
Well, I came back to tell you that I am sure.
I got to thinking it over on the bus, and I came to the conclusion that it was room 274, or close to it, anyway.
Somehow or other, I couldn't help feeling touched to think, of all the sordid hotels you've been in, you should have remembered that one.
The age of chivalry still lives!
- What?
- I said, romance is not dead!
- Oh.
- You give up everything, risk your life, walk unafraid into the valley of the shadow to aid and comfort a damsel in distress.
Isn't that truth?
Yes, that's the truth, plainly and simply put.
Give me some more champagne.
Another bottle of champagne.
Hi, Captain.
Mr. Van.
What's happened?
Was there some mistake at the frontier?
No.
No mistake.
It's just that I'm an incurable sap, I guess.
I'll be seeing you, Captain.
Look, Harry.
A souvenir of Omaha.
I told you then that I wasn't everybody.
And it's true.
I'm nobody.
But I learned there was no use telling the truth to people whose whole life is a lie.
So I thought if I told lies big enough, I'd make myself big.
But I can't lie to you, Harry.
You're different from all the rest.
All these years, you've been surrounded by blondes, and you've loved only me.
Quit pawing me, will you?
If you're hooking up with me, it's for professional reasons only.
See?
Yes, I see.
Yeah, and what's more, I'm the manager.
I'll fix it with the captain so that we'll get across the border tomorrow or the next day, or soon.
We'll join up with the girls in Geneva.
And while we're working there, you and I will rehearse the code.
The code?
Of course, the code!
I'll learn it easily!
I shall be the greatest mind-reader in the war room.
If you're gonna qualify for this act with me, you gotta lay off the liquor.
I mean, after this is gone.
It's a well-known fact that booze and science don't mix.
I don't think I shall use my own name.
No.
Americans would mispronounce it horribly.
I shall call myself Namoura.
Namoura the Great!
Assisted by Harry Van.
I shall wear a black velvet dress.
Very plain.
My skin, of course, ivory white.
I must have something to hold.
One white flower.
A little white prayer book.
That's it!
A little white--
What's that?
What is it, Captain?
Enemy airplanes.
Reprisal for last night.
- They're coming to destroy our base here.
- I see.
They have no reason to attack this hotel, but accidents might easily happen.
I advise the cellar.
- Please, Madame, please do come!
- In a moment, Captain.
I entreat you, Madame, not to be reckless.
I have enough on my conscience right now without wishing to add to it your innocent life.
Don't worry, Captain.
Death and I are old friends.
God be with you, Madame.
The beasts are bombing us!
Everyone goes to the cellar.
- Thanks, pal.
- Quickly!
Hurry!
I wouldn't like to die in a cellar.
Would you, Harry?
No, but that's where we're going.
Come on!
I love you, Harry.
And you adore me, don't you, darling?
- Did I ever say so?
- No, of course not!
You'll never admit it.
We're not gonna die in a cellar, after all, Harry.
No, nor in any other place, if I can help it.
Harry, you realize the whole world has gone to war?
- The whole world!
- I realize it, but don't ask me why.
I'm stuck trying to figure it out.
I know why it is.
It's just to kill us, you and me.
Because we are the little people.
And for us, the deadliest weapons are the most merciful!
- Take it easy, babe.
- I never cared before, Harry, but now I want to live!
So do I. But if we don't, let's hope we make a fast exit.
And together!
Nice try, buddy, but you muffed!
Harry...
Do you know any hymns?
- What?
- I said, do you know any hymns?
Sure.
Sure, I do.
Which one?
Any one.
Something you used to sing when you were a little boy.
âª Abide with me âª âª Fast falls the eventide âª âª The darkness deepens âª âª Lord, with me abide âª âª When other helpers fail âª
âª And comforts flee âª âª Help of the helpless âª
I've loved you all the time, Irene.
Thanks for telling me, darling.
âª I fear no foe âª âª With Thee at hand to bless âª âª Ills have no weight âª âª And tears no bitterness âª
âª Where is death's sting?
âª âª Where, grave, thy victory?
âª âª I triumph still âª âª If Thou abide with me âª
Look, Harry!
They've gone away!
"Senator Samuel Foley dead."
Died here at Saint Vincent's.
"At the bedside was political sidekick Senator Joseph Paine."
Long distance?
Joseph Paine speaking. I want the governor's residence, Jackson City.
Oh, Joe!
Oh, no!
Couldn't have happened at a worse time.
Call Jim Taylor. Tell him I'm flying home tonight.
Right away.
What is it?
- Sam Foley's dead.
- Great saints!
Of all times Foley had to go and die on us.
Who are you calling?
Taylor, my dear.
What's up, Happy?
Sam Foley died tonight.
That's too bad.
Well, don't get excited. Is Paine coming?
Yes, Jim.
Yes, Jim.
He'd drop dead if you ever said no.
My dear, this is no time for jokes.
I've got to appoint a new senator.
The governor will see all committees.
The governor will see all committees.
Tell him I won't wait any longer.
Probably got Taylor in there, telling him what to do.
Tell them to wait. I'll see them immediately.
I can't put those howling citizens off any longer.
They'll want something to say about who takes Foley's place.
Ten to one they've got a man.
Relax, Happy.
Stop having kittens.
Go and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine I'll give them one more minute to make up their minds.
You go tell Jim Taylor.
I will tell him.
It's high time I told Jim Taylor a thing or two.
If you and Joe gab any longer about this appointment I'll see those committees.
You'll see them when we're finished.
But hurry, will you?
That's telling him, Happy, old boy.
Jim with this Willet Creek Dam coming up the man who takes Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn.
We must be absolutely sure of him.
That's why I say Horace Miller.
He'll take orders all right.
Suppose we don't try to go through with this dam.
Suppose we postpone it until next session of Congress.
Or drop it altogether.
That'd be a crime, Joe.
After all the work we put in on it?
Burying it in this deficiency bill as nicely as you please.
Having it approved. It's rolling along.
Like taking candy from a baby.
Is it worth the risk of a scandal, with a new man in the Senate?
Worth the risk?
What's the matter with you?
Where you're concerned, I wouldn't take the slightest risk especially with your great reputation in the Senate.
Here, look.
Look at the campaign I started for you in all my papers.
A little obscure, isn't it?
I don't know. Maybe.
But after all, you're the logical man from the West for the national ticket.
At the convention, anything can happen.
If what you say is possible why not do as I say and drop things like this dam?
We can't do it, Joe.
We've been quietly buying all the land around that dam and holding it in dummy names.
If we drop it now, it'll bring about an investigation.
It'll show that we're going to sell it to the state under phony names.
The smartest thing for us to do is to push this dam through and get it over with.
All right, appoint Miller.
If you're sure he'll take orders.
Don't worry. He'll take orders.
Come on.
Just a minute. Just one more minute!
We've got your man.
Horace Miller.
A born stooge!
Horace will perform like a trained seal.
What did I tell you?
If I throw a party man like Miller...
For reasons I can't go into, it's got to be him.
Do you understand? Now make out your ticket.
Come on.
But I've got to see those angry committees first.
Work for harmony.
Harmony!
In considering candidates who might have the high qualifications of U.S. senator one name shone out like a beacon the Honorable Horace Miller.
A party man. He's Taylor's stooge!
Please!
New Citizens Committee won't stand for this!
So they named their own candidate, eh?
Who?
- You won't like him.
- Come on, who?
Henry Hill.
That crackpot?
You should've killed that so fast...
I couldn't.
- Those men were...
- Never mind.
You forget about them.
That bunch is out for blood. If I...
I said forget about them.
Horace Miller goes to the Senate, and that settles it.
I won't send Horace Miller.
- You won't?
- No, I won't.
I won't let you callously wreck my whole political future.
Your political future?
I bought it for you as a present.
I can grab it back so fast it'll make your head swim.
You've got a nerve to sit and worry about your future when we're in a spot like this.
The man is Miller.
Hello, Dad.
What's the matter? Is it getting you down?
Is what getting me down?
You're in a deuce of a pickle.
Looks like Henry Hill or else.
It's Horace Miller or else.
Peter!
I wouldn't appoint a twerp like Miller, Taylor or no Taylor.
May I ask what Taylor has to do with this?
He's still running the show, ain't he?
I won't have conversation of this sort carried on at dinner.
Why don't you listen to them for a change?
No doubt they can make this appointment for me with ease.
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
I beg your pardon?
He's the only senator to have.
He ought to be President.
I like Jeff Smith.
You too? Now everybody's been heard from.
Forgive my ignorance, but I don't know him from a hole in the ground.
- Gosh, head of the Boy Rangers!
- Oh, a boy?
No, Dad. Jeff's a man. Jeff Smith.
Biggest expert we got in wild game...
Right now he's the greatest hero we ever had.
It's all over the headlines.
Didn't you see about the forest fire all around Sweetwater?
I did. What about it?
- Jeff put that out himself.
- Himself?
If you really want a senator...
I do not want a senator.
I do not want any more nonsense.
He's the greatest American we got.
He can tell you what George Washington said, by heart.
And Stuff has the swellest stuff in it.
What "stuff"?
Boys' Stuff. The name of Jeff's paper.
He prints it. Look, here's one.
Everybody reads it.
All the kids in the state. A million of them. Let me read...
I'm in no mood to listen to childish prattle.
Prattle?
You're all wet.
You couldn't do better.
- Better than what?
- Jeff for senator.
Emma, if you please!
Want to get out of a pickle, don't you?
Always looking for votes, aren't you?
Here's 50,000 kids, two folks each, and they vote.
If you want to do some good in this state...
If you're ever going to stand up like a man...
That settles it!
I won't be belittled by my own children in my own home.
All my nerves are strained to the breaking point!
Henry Hill....
Horace Miller....
Miller? Hill?
Hill?
Miller?
Heads, Hill.
Tails, Miller.
That's good enough for me.
Good evening.
Is Jefferson Smith at home?
Won't you step in?
- A Boy Ranger to the U.S. Senate?
- Listen.
The simpleton of all times. A big-eyed patriot.
Knows Lincoln and Washington by heart.
Stands at attention in the governor's presence.
Collects stray boys and cats.
He does what?
You know, a perfect man.
Never in politics in his life.
Wouldn't know what it's all about in 2 years, let alone 2 months.
The important thing this was the genius of the stroke it means votes.
The hero of 50,000 boys and 100,000 parents.
Look over those congratulations pouring in.
I tell you, gentlemen...
You made this appointment without asking me.
When lightning strikes...
- You didn't ask me.
Now wait a minute, Jim.
Happy may have hit on something here.
There, you see?
Do you really think you can handle him in Washington?
Do you think it's all right?
I think it's all right.
A young patriot recites Lincoln and Jefferson turned loose in our nation's capitol.
I think it's all right.
Chick.
Turn the ballyhoo boys loose. It's the greatest appointment ever made.
Give a banquet and declare a holiday.
A star-spangled banquet!
And how did your governor confer that honor?
Did he give it to some wealthy citizen, merely to curry favor?
No!
Did he give it to some unworthy political hireling?
What did he do?
He went down among the people.
And there he found a nugget.
It is in that spirit that we're here tonight to acclaim and wish Godspeed to Senator Jefferson Smith.
Thank you.
I can't help feeling that there's been a big mistake somehow.
Of course, I never could see why we needed two senators from this state when we have a man like Joseph Harrison Paine representing us.
He doesn't remember me.
He knew my father very well.
Clayton Smith.
They went to school together.
They were very good friends.
Just to... sit here with him is a very great honor for me because I remember Dad used to tell me that Joe Paine was the finest man he ever knew.
Go on, get up. Take a bow!
I don't think I'll be much help to you down there in Washington, senator.
I'll do my best.
Although with all my might I can promise you one thing:
I'll do nothing to disgrace the office of United States Senate.
Senator Jefferson Smith the Boy Rangers are very proud to take this opportun...
Occasion!
We are happy to take this opportunity...
To present....
To resent this small token of our affection and esteem to the best...
Friend!
Aw, heck. It's a briefcase, Jeff.
We all pitched in.
For to carry your laws when you get to Washington.
It isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's.
Boys' Stuff. Why, printer's ink runs in your veins.
You're just like your father.
- Thank you, sir.
- Even to the hat.
Same old dreamer too.
One look at you and I can see him back at his roll-top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper.
Always kept his hat on so as to be ready to do battle.
Clayton Smith, editor and publisher.
And champion of lost causes.
Dad used to say the only causes worth fighting for were the lost causes.
You don't have to tell me.
We were a team, the two of us.
Struggling editor and the struggling lawyer.
The twin champions of lost causes, they called us.
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
His last fight was his best, Jeff.
He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate.
All to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim.
They tried everything.
Bribery intimidation.
And then....
Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning.
Shot in the back.
I was there.
I can see him.
At that old roll-top desk.
Still with his hat on.
Still with his hat on.
I know.
I suppose, Mr. Paine when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Washington, huh?
Yes, senator, for the fifth time. Washington.
I'd better see about my pigeons.
The porter has them.
Just a second. I'd better make sure.
Joe, my head's like a balloon.
Two whole days! I never knew there was so much American history.
They're all right.
That's fine. That ends that crisis.
Come along, senator.
Hello, Father!
- I saw!
- He's mine!
Let me get to him.
I don't care to meet him till I get my money.
A dollar each, please, for the milk fund.
That's $5.
You've got $5, haven't you?
Can't seem to find anything except keys.
Jeff, this is my daughter Susan and her friends.
- Not the new senator?
- He's marvelous.
What have you got there, senator?
- They're pigeons.
- To carry messages back to Ma.
It's just for fun. The one that makes it home in the best time I'll enter in the Nationals.
- Joe!
- Hello, Chick.
- Hello, Joe.
- Carl, how are you?
Glad to see you, Bill.
Jeff, come here.
Meet Cook and Griffith, from State Headquarters.
Great pleasure. You'll do the old state proud.
Welcome. The wildlife here is different from what you're used to.
They wear high heels.
We must see a lot of you...
- ...and your little feathered friends.
- Thank you very much.
Come on, Father.
Chick.
I've got him. We'll be along.
Good luck, senator.
Goodbye.
Things sure happen fast around here.
You'll have to get yourself out of low gear.
Let's get these bags and livestock.
Okay, Chick.
Look, there it is!
Who? What?
The Capitol dome.
Yes, sir, big as life.
Been there a long time now.
Yes, sir.
This way, senator.
We thought we'd meet him in short pants with hatchets.
Taxi.
What's he got pigeons for?
What for?
Suppose there's a storm. The lines are down.
How you going to get messages back to Ma?
This way, senator.
Where is he?
Senator?
I told that Cookie to....
Let's find him.
Senator!
Senator Smith?
Positively not in the station.
What happened?
Did you look in the...?
I'll brain that guy.
Call Paine. Call Saunders.
Call the Marines. Call somebody!
Saunders?
McGann.
Has Smith showed up at his office there yet?
What do you mean, the slip? What's so funny?
Nothing.
Why don't you try a butterfly net?
If he shows up Paine's waiting at the hotel with newspapermen.
Let him know right away. Understand?
I'll hang a light in the belfry. One if by land and two if by sea.
- Diz?
- Yeah.
What do you think?
Daniel Boone's lost.
Lost in the wilds of Washington.
If your boyfriend's going to blaze trails I'm going to the press club.
Stick around. He might want us to put on short pants and go hiking.
You wouldn't want to miss the exercise.
When I think of exercise, I have to lie down until the feeling leaves me.
Wouldn't it be funny if he was lost?
The Boy Ranger?
Oh, he'll show up.
He must have a compass with him.
Where would I go if I were a Boy Ranger?
Boy, am I tired. I'm all in!
Call all the hospitals. And get me a bed while you're at it!
Boss, will you hold this a minute?
Thank you, sir.
Here! Come back here!
...that from these honored dead we take increased devotion that that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly....
- Resolve.
- Resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.
That this nation under God, shall have a new birth of....
Freedom.
Freedom.
And that government, of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth.
Why don't they try the police?
Call out some bloodhounds or Indian guides.
One place he knows is the Senate office.
You stay there and wait.
All right, another half-hour.
Just one half-hour. Goodbye.
Oh, why don't I quit?
Eight to five, little boy blue's plastered.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out?
How many times have I said I'm fed up with politics and I...
No, I let them talk me into staying.
Secretary to a leader of little squirts.
Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Would you settle for a husband?
I sure would.
You know my old standing offer.
Diz Moore poet of Washington correspondents.
Oh, that again.
I'd cherish you and I'd stay sober.
Diz, you're a wonderful egg.
I don't know, maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed or something....
I don't think even that would do it.
No point in combing my hair for nothing.
"Honorary appointment."
Scratch this and you'll find they need a dope here for a couple of months.
Yes?
Yes!
What do you want?
Office of Jefferson Smith?
The man downstairs said...
They sure must have picked the prize dummy...
Say, wait a minute!
That wouldn't be Daniel Boone?
Say, mister what's your name?
Jefferson Smith.
Oh, yes, please...
Now, hold everything.
Stay there. Now, don't move!
Helen! Get me the Madison. Senator Paine.
Hurry up, will you?
Is anything the matter?
My dear senator it may be customary out on the prairie to take leave of people and not show up for five hours...
I'm very sorry about that, Miss Sau...
You are Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Yes, and this is Mr. Moore, member of the press.
Mr. Moore, meet the senator.
I'm very happy to know you.
I see you cut your way through that forest.
Senator Paine. We've got him!
Came in on his own power, and he's sober.
Next thing on the schedule, I'll have him over there.
Now....
I'm awfully sorry.
It wasn't until I was well along on the bus that...
Did you say bus?
It was one of those sightseers, you know?
And I've never been called absent-minded before but there it was, all of a sudden.
It was staring at me through the station doors.
There what was?
The dome. The Capitol dome.
As big as life, sparkling away under the old sun out there.
And I I just started to go toward it.
There was a bus outside and I just naturally got aboard.
Most natural thing in the world.
I don't think I've ever been so thrilled in my whole life.
And that Lincoln Memorial!
Gee whiz!
Why, Mr. Lincoln, there he is.
He's looking right straight at you as you come up those steps.
Just sitting there, like he was waiting for somebody to come along.
Well, he's got nothing on me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
If you're ready, we'll go to the hotel.
Senator Paine's waiting for you.
This is my office?
No, you'll have a private office.
- In there.
- Private office?
In there?
Right in this door?
All right, now, senator....
Where is he? Has he gone out again?
He's in there.
I'll see you later.
I got to go out and drink this over.
Whose statue's that?
I wouldn't know, in the daytime.
You wouldn't? Oh, look!
Look at the Capitol dome! It's all lighted up.
You better relax, senator. You'll get yourself plum wore out.
Gee whiz! So many things happening all at once.
Miss Saunders, what time does the Senate....
Convene?
- Twelve noon.
- Twelve noon, huh?
Oh, boy, that'll be something!
You know what I better do in the morning?
No, what had you better?
I think I better go out to Mount Vernon.
Be sort of a fine thing to do.
Visit Washington's home before walking into the Senate for the first time.
Think it's a good idea?
Wonderful! Puts you right in the mood.
What's that? What's that?
Movie houses.
Hi, Saunders.
I'm still asking myself, what is he:
Animal, vegetable or mineral?
Maybe an oyster.
When I think of myself playing straight for that phony, patriotic chatter. Me!
Carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists.
I can't take it, Diz. I quit. I'm through.
Now take it easy. Simmer down. Here.
Take this.
Know what he's doing tomorrow before taking the Senate seat?
Going up to Mount Vernon to get in the mood.
Who? Your boss?
A nut! I knew there was a story in him. I smelled it!
Go chase an ambulance.
It's meat and drink to me. Let me at him five minutes.
I'll make it right.
What do you mean "right"?
I'll tell you what I'll do.
World Series. A pass!
In a month it'll be worth 15 bucks.
Well!
You're not talking to this guy.
- What do you say?
- Nothing. Beat it.
How would your pals like to get in on this?
- I want a scoop.
- Beat it!
That's out. Either it's lots of reporters and tickets, or....
Better call him before I change my mind.
Okay. I'll see you right here.
What are you going to do?
Get my whole fall outfit and quit this job in style.
You've got more sense than to put Nosey on to that guy.
Open your eyes! Open your eyes!
Tell us about yourself.
I hear you got a boys' club, senator.
Any special ax to grind?
- Ax?
- You know.
Pet idea. Save the buffaloes, pension bill.
You must have one idea that would be good for the country.
Well, I have got one idea.
That's what we want.
For the last couple years, I've thought it would be a wonderful idea to have a national boys' camp in our state.
Boys' camp? Sure. Very good!
If we could get poor kids off the streets out of the cities for a few months in the summer and let them learn something about nature American ideals....
Marvelous.
What would it cost the government?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
You see the government just lends us the money for the camp and then the boys pay it back by sending pennies, nickels, nothing more than a dime.
That's really something.
Government's got enough to do without...
The government's putting too much dough in too many places now, boys.
Well, now, senator, tell me what do you think of the girls in this town?
Down at the station, four of them kissed me when I got off the train.
Were they pretty? - Pretty?
That Miss Susan Paine is about the prettiest I ever saw.
Senator, you got a good eye!
How about some more pictures?
You're a nature lover can you handle sign language?
I could manage, if...
What about birdcalls? You know any?
- Can you make a sound like an eagle?
- How about a bobwhite?
Here's one. I'm the only one in the state that knows this one.
We could use that!
His "First 'Whiff' of Washington"?
Do I actually see this?
What is it?
Did you want to see me?
What's this I hear about your quitting?
- I'm not a nurse.
Stop being funny.
How'd this happen?
- I haven't the slightest idea.
- Yes, you have. How'd it happen?
I merely took him home.
I didn't tuck him in. That's McGann's job.
McGann just phoned. Smith's gone again. Do you know where?
He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
That's fine.
Now you go back to Smith's office and get him to the Senate by 12:00.
Senator, I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger the time.
Don't be a fool.
If certain things happen you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
When I came here, my eyes were big blue question marks now they're big green dollar marks.
Smart girl, eh?
Finish this job properly and you'll get a bonus.
I mean, keep Smith away from anything that smacks of politics.
Including Willet Creek Dam?
Including Willet Creek Dam.
Now go back to your work.
This is it, senator.
The United States Senate.
Come on.
Mr. Carson, Senator Smith.
- How do you do?
- How do you do, senator?
Page!
- Glad to see you. - Thank you.
Show Senator Smith to his seat.
Right this way, sir.
Well, goodbye.
Wish me luck.
- Sure.
Bye.
So that's the boy wonder?
I don't know what the Senate's coming to.
- Hi, Diz.
- Hello, Saunders.
Daryl, Sweeney.
I see you got Daniel Boone in all right.
Daniel in the lion's den.
Nice job you and the ambulance chasers did in the papers this morning.
- Did you like it?
- Great.
Here you are, Senator.
Not a bad desk, either.
Daniel Webster used to use it.
Daniel Webster sat here?
Holy mackerel!
Give you something to shoot at, if you figure on doing any talking.
I'm just going to sit and listen.
That's the way to get re-elected.
This is the calendar for the day.
You'll find this and a manual, in here.
Anything else just snap for a page.
Where's the majority leader?
Majority leader?
Right over there. Senator Agnew.
That's Senator Barnes, the minority leader.
Where's the press gallery?
There, above the vice president's chair.
Those in the front row represent the big news services.
What's up there?
That's for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes at a time to rest their feet.
That section is reserved for the senators' friends.
Front row, the empty one, is for the President and his guests.
I see.
Over the clock is the diplomatic section.
They and the pageboys are the only real class we have here.
- Thanks so much.
- I'll take your hat to the cloakroom.
I want to give you a Boy Ranger button.
Swell!
What's your name?
- Richard Jones.
Thanks ever so much.
Good luck, senator. Keep your left up.
- See you in the White House, Joe.
- You're not kidding!
- Jeff.
- Hello, senator.
I was in committee.
That's all right, sir.
I see you had a little publicity.
Have you got your credentials?
Miss Saunders gave them to me.
Is that right?
That's fine.
When the vice president calls you... - ...
I'll meet you in the center aisle.
- Center aisle.
This is Daniel Webster's desk. Did you know that?
He won't mind.
The Senate will come to order.
Chaplain will pray.
Oh, God, our Heavenly Father in these critical days when our beloved country labors with such grave problems look upon us and give us the strength to be just and merciful so we may best serve our people and our fellow men everywhere.
Amen.
- Clerk will read...
- Mr. President I ask unanimous consent the reading of the journal be dispensed with.
Is there objection?
Journal stands approved.
Mr. President.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
Clerk will call the roll.
- Mr. Agnew. - Here.
- Mr. Albert.
- Here.
- Mr. Alfred. - Here.
88 senators have answered to their names, all as present.
- Mr. President.
- Senator Paine.
I present the credentials of Honorable Jefferson Smith who has just been appointed by the governor of my state.
The designate is present.
I ask that the oath of office be administered at this time.
The senator designate will present himself.
The oath will be administered.
Mr. President I rise to a question of order.
- Here it comes.
- I seek to ascertain if the gentleman about to be sworn in is aware of the responsibilities of his office.
I refer to his shameless performance for the newspapers.
A versatile performance, I grant you and one that his party, no doubt, will applaud.
But one that lowers his rank to the level of a sideshow entertainer and reflects on the sincerity, if not the sanity of the highest body of lawmakers in the land.
I seek to learn if this is the gentleman's conception of the nature of his office.
I don't understand.
The designate has no voice here until taking the oath of office.
Mr. President, I will answer the gentleman.
My colleague was innocent in this matter.
He was completely misquoted.
I know Jefferson Smith, and I will personally vouch for him.
He has the greatest respect for his office and for these gentleman.
Mr. President.
The swearing in of the senator designate is the order of business.
The gentleman will raise his right hand.
Do you swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic and that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same?
That you take this obligation freely without mental reservation or purpose of evasion and that you will faithfully discharge the duties of this office so help you God?
I do.
Senator, you can talk all you want to now.
Meet the majority leader.
He'll be a good friend to you.
How do you do, sir?
Any friend of Joe's is a friend of mine.
Don't worry about the others, they're just senators.
- Mr. President.
- Senator MacPherson.
The shameless way the deficiency bill has been delayed is nothing short of criminal.
Government agencies are in desperate need of these funds.
The prime business of this body is the immediate passage....
- Hello, Nosey. Who let you in here?
Why aren't you chasing ambulances?
Smith's punching everybody he meets. I just got away.
Uh-oh, Tarzan!
Boys, meet Senator Smith.
You act like something's on your mind.
Why don't you tell the people the truth?
- The truth?
- He wants the truth!
The man wants the truth.
"'What is the truth?
' said jesting Pilate and would not stay for an answer."
How do you want it? Dished out or in a bottle?
People pick up their papers, and what do they read?
This morning they read that a clown arrived in Washington parading like a member of the Senate.
If you thought as much about being honest as you do about being smart....
We're the only ones who can be honest in what we tell the voters.
We don't have to be re-elected, like politicians.
We tell them when phonies and crackpots come here to make their laws.
If you want the truth, why are you in the Senate?
What do you know about making laws? Or what the people need?
I don't pretend to know.
Then what are you doing in the Senate?
What's he doing? Why, honorary appointment!
When the country needs men who know and have courage as it never did before he's going to decorate a chair and get honored.
But he'll vote! Just like his colleague tells him too.
Like a Christmas tiger, he'll nod his head and vote "Yes!"
You're not a senator.
You're an honorary stooge. You ought to be shown up.
Have a drink, senator?
It'll taste better than the truth.
Hey, senator.
Don't let it get you down.
100 years from now, nobody'll know the difference.
The point is, sir, they're right.
I'm just sitting in the Senate, decorating a chair.
If I'm going to vote, I ought to study the bills that are coming up.
The bills?
Yes, sir. Otherwise, I'm just a Christmas tiger, like they said.
These bills are put together by legal minds after long study.
I can't understand half of them myself, and I was a lawyer.
Come on. Forget it.
I'll advise you how to vote.
I know you will. That's the point.
There's no reason for me to be here.
Didn't you say something about wanting to create a national boys' camp?
- You were in earnest, weren't you?
- Yes, I was.
Why don't you do it? There's a job for you.
Get a bill started. Present it to Congress.
It will be great experience.
Senator Paine, I've been aching to mention it to you.
If I could do that one thing while I'm here, I'd feel...
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you.
Well, I'll do it. I will!
I knew if anyone could help me, you could.
Thank you again for your time.
Good night.
Where are you running off to?
I'm anxious to get back to the office.
The man on the front page!
- He just dropped in for a minute.
- How do you do, senator?
How do you do, Miss Paine?
I'm on my way to the office.
- How are the pigeons?
- They're fine.
I miss the dear little things.
I released one this morning with a letter.
He flew right straight up in the air to get his bearings.
He went around the Capitol dome, then headed west, like a bat out of...
Just like a rifle shot.
I suppose by about this time he's probably over Kentucky.
Isn't that wonderful, Father?
And was the letter to your girl?
No, I don't have a girl.
Don't you think I'd better hold this for you?
No, I think I'd better go.
Good night.
Doggone!
It's all right, sir.
That's all right, my boy. Don't bother.
Gee, I'm sorry.
Good night.
Good night, Jeff.
Good night.
Oh, Father!
Dear me!
At the expense of some of the furniture you've made another conquest.
Not old Honest Abe!
And with Honest Abe's ideals.
A rare man these days, Susan.
We're going ahead with it.
Ahead with what?
My bill for a national boys' camp.
Where's my briefcase?
Do I understand that you're going to present a bill?
Senator Paine and I decided...
Senator Paine decided with you?
I should have been the one to think of it.
My dear senator have you the faintest idea how to get a bill passed?
You're going to help me.
If I were triplets I could.
Senator Paine said you'd help me.
What do we have to have?
Look, do you mind if I give you a rough idea what you're up against?
No, go ahead.
A senator has a bill in mind, like your camp, right?
What does he do?
He has to sit down and write it.
The why, when, where, how and everything else.
That takes time.
But this one is so simple.
I see. This one's simple.
- And with your help...
- Oh, I'm helping.
Simple, and I'm helping so we knock it off in record time, say three or four days.
Oh, a day.
- A day?
- Yes, just tonight.
Tonight.
I don't want to complain but in civilized countries there's an institution called "dinner."
I'm sort of hungry myself.
Couldn't we have some stuff brought in on trays, like big executives?
Oh, sure.
Dinner comes in on trays.
We light into this...
And we finish the bill before morning.
It's dawn.
Your bill is ready. You introduce it.
How?
You get to your feet take a breath, and start spouting.
Not too loud. A couple of the senators might want to sleep.
A curly-headed pageboy takes it to the desk where a clerk reads it, refers it to a committee...
Committee, huh? Why?
Committees. Small groups of senators have to sift a bill down study it, and report to the Senate.
Can't take a bill nobody ever heard of and discuss it among 96 men.
I see that.
Good. Now, where are we?
Some committee's got it.
Days are going by, senator.
Days, weeks!
Finally, they think it's quite a bill.
It goes to the House of Representatives for a vote...
- ...but waits on the calendar.
- Calendar?
That's the order of business.
Your bill has to stand back in line...
- ...unless the steering committee...
What's that?
Steering committee?
Do you really think we're getting anywhere?
Tell me, what's the steering committee?
Committee of the majority party leaders.
They decide when a bill is important enough to be at the head of the list.
Well, this is.
Pardon me. This is.
Where are we now? - Over in the House.
Oh, yeah. House.
More amendments, more changes, and the bill goes back to the Senate.
The Senate doesn't like what the House did; they make more changes.
The House doesn't like those changes. Stymied.
So?
So they appoint men from each House to go into a huddle called a conference, and they battle it out.
Finally, if your bill is still alive after all this vivisection it comes to a vote.
Yes, sir!
The big day finally arrives and Congress adjourns.
Catching on, senator?
Shall we start right away or order dinner first?
Pardon me?
I said, shall we start...
Oh, sure.
Why not?
Do you mind if I take the time to go get a pencil?
- Go right ahead!
- Thank you very much.
Go right ahead. And lots of paper too.
Now, the... Doggone it!
Ever have so much to say about something, you just couldn't say it?
- Try sitting down. - I did.
I got right back up.
Let's get down to particulars.
How big is this thing? Where is it?
How many boys will it accommodate?
You've got to have all that in it, you know?
And something else, Miss Saunders.
The spirit of it. The idea.
How do you say it?
That's what's got to be in it.
The Capitol dome.
On paper?
I want to make that come to life for every boy in this land.
Yes, and all lighted up like that too.
You see, boys forget what their country means by just reading "the land of the free" in history books.
They get to be men and forget even more.
Liberty is too precious a thing to be buried in books, Miss Saunders.
Men should hold it up in front of them every single day of their lives and say I'm free to think and to speak.
My ancestors couldn't.
I can and my children will.
Boys ought to grow up remembering that.
And that steering committee, they've got to see it like that.
I know Senator Paine will do all he can to help me, because...
He's a wonderful man, isn't he?
- He knew my father real well.
- He did?
We need a lot more like him. His kind of character, his ideals.
Let's get on with this.
This camp will be in your state?
About 200 of the most beautiful acres that ever were.
You've never been out in that country, have you?
I've been over every single foot of it.
You have to see it yourself.
I don't know.
The prairies, and wind leaning on the tall grass lazy streams down in the meadows angry little midgets of water up in the mountains.
Cattle moving down the slope, against the sun.
Campfires and snowdrifts....
Everybody ought to have some of that, sometime in his life.
My dad had the right idea.
He had it all worked out.
He used to say to me, "Son don't miss the wonders that surround you.
Because every tree, every rock, every anthill, every star is filled with the wonders of nature."
He used to say to me "Did you ever notice how grateful you are to see daylight after coming through a long, dark tunnel?"
"Well," he'd say, "always try to see life around you as if you just came out of a tunnel."
Where did you come from?
I guess I've always lived in a tunnel.
You mean here?
Baltimore. Pure city dweller.
Have you always had to work?
Since I was about sixteen.
Sixteen?
I take it your parents couldn't...
No, Father was a doctor.
He thought more of ethics than he did of collections.
Speaks well for Father, but it wasn't so...
Now, look, we'd better get back to this.
Hasn't been easy, has it?
No complaints.
For a woman, you've done awfully well.
Have I?
I've never known anyone as capable and intelligent....
I don't know where I'd be in this bill if it wasn't for your help.
I don't know where you are with it.
Gee whiz, we've got to get going with this.
All right, now, let's see.
Everybody calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Go right ahead.
Saunders.
That's much better.
"Hello, Saunders." "Good morning, Saunders."
- "How's the bill coming, Saunders?"
- Terrible, thank you.
Anyway, I got that "Saunders" business straightened out.
All right, now! I...
What's your first name?
Why?
Everybody calls you just "Saunders."
I also answer to whistles.
You've got a first name?
Yes, but we just better forget about it.
All right, all right.
I was just curious.
A picture popped into my mind of a pump without a handle or something.
Of course, I know what it is. Violet.
No, it isn't.
Abigail?
Letitia?
Lena?
You might as well tell me. I've got a lot more.
All right. You win.
It's Clarissa.
Clarissa.
All right, Saunders, let's go!
Now, Susan's an awfully pretty name, isn't it?
Susan? Susan Paine? Oh, it's beautiful.
She's a beautiful woman, isn't she?
Isn't she a beautiful girl? I think she's about the most beautiful...
We've got to get started on this, or we'll never get it finished.
Get set, because I'm going to talk much faster than you can write.
You ready?
The location of this camp.
About 200 acres situated in Ambrose County, Terry Canyon.
Running a quarter mile on either side of Willet Creek.
What?
Willet Creek.
W-I-L-L-E-T.
It's a little stream.
In Terry Canyon?
You don't know it, do you?
You've never been there, you said.
You've discussed this with Senator Paine, haven't you?
No, no. Why?
Nothing. It doesn't matter.
There's no reason to talk it over with him.
"A quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek."
And the land to be bought by the contribution of the boys the money to be loaned to us by the United States.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
What did you get me out of bed for? Sit tight.
The show's about to commence.
Mind telling me what's going on?
Certainly.
There's the principal actor in our little play.
"Don Quixote" Smith, Man With Bill.
- Here, one of the supporting characters.
Who?
That gorilla in man's clothing, McGann.
You mean Puss-in-Boots?
Mostly Puss.
Another prominent character in our play, the Silver Knight.
Soul of honor on a tightrope.
You wouldn't be a little goofy, would you?
Don Quixote will stand up in a minute and speak two important words "Willet Creek."
Then the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and "Puss" will jump out of his boots.
It is so ordered.
Introduction of new bills and joint resolutions.
Mr. President!
The chair recognizes the rather strong-lunged junior senator Mr. Smith.
I'm sorry. I have a bill...
You may speak a little louder.
But not too loud.
I have a bill to propose.
Order, gentlemen.
Our junior senator is about to make a speech.
You may proceed.
"Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives that there be appropriated as a loan a sum sufficient to create a national boys' camp to be paid back to the U.S. Treasury by contributions from boys of America.
This camp to be situated on land at and adjacent to the headwaters of a stream known as Willet Creek in Terry Canyon for the purpose of bringing together boys of all walks of life from various parts of the country.
Boys of all creeds, kinds and positions.
To educate them in American ideals and to promote mutual understanding.
To bring about a healthful life to the youth of this great and beautiful land."
Our senator will make a good orator when his voice stops changing.
I'm getting leery of him. We call him dumb, but he keeps getting in our hair.
When he finds out a dam is going up where he wants his boys' camp he's going to ask questions.
Be quiet. I'm trying to think.
This deficiency bill will be read tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
He'll hear that section on the Willet Dam. He can't be there.
I'll take him to see monuments, even if I have to hit him on the head with one.
That won't work.
This boy's honest, not stupid.
Susan.
My daughter won't carry out such assignments.
Senator! If you let me handle your publicity...
Down, everybody!
Who are those people?
Phonies, office seekers, cranks.
"Get my son in or out of West Point..."
This machine creates a fever 10 miles away. It'll make you a fortune.
Long-distance fevers.
A woman wrote a song to replace "The Star-Spangled Banner."
Want to hear it?
- Not today.
I feel like a house afire. Even went to see Mr. Lincoln.
- How did I do?
- Great.
My heart was right up to here all the time.
What did Paine think?
- Tickled pink.
Oh, boy! I hope so.
What's all this?
- From boys who read about your camp.
Already? All these letter...
Those are only local. Wait till they start pouring in from all over.
You mean... I'd better open one up. Let's see what they say here.
Look, there's money. Let me see.
"Dear Senator Smith I'd like to come to camp.
Here's 9 cents." Isn't that wonderful?
And he signs it, "Yours truly, Stinky Moore."
Isn't that marvelous?
If there's money in each one of these, what will we do with it?
A bank! That's perfect.
You can see how important this bill will be. Is there any paper?
Second drawer.
That's fine. I'll be pretty busy tonight.
Not another bill?
Letters. I'm busting with news!
I introduced a bill. Me, Jeff Smith!
I spoke in the Senate!
Want to dictate them? - The letters?
I couldn't talk letters.
I'll sit here and scratch them down.
And say I'm going to tell Ma all about you.
And if I tell it right, you'll get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
Thank you very much.
Gee whiz, I forgot to thank you.
Don't mention it.
Without you, I couldn't have, I mean....
Who?
Susan Paine.
How do you do? Yes, I can talk. Go right ahead.
I'm sorry to bother you, but you've got to help me.
I'm elected to snatch Mr. Smith from the Senate tomorrow.
You're what?
I'm to turn my glamour on for him. You sympathize, don't you?
Awkward, isn't it?
Take him out and buy him a suit of clothes that fits and a hat that he can hang on to.
And a manicure and a haircut wouldn't do any harm.
As one woman to another, I hate to ask you to do this, but....
As one woman to another, of course.
Thanks, and...
Just a minute.
Miss Paine.
Susan Paine?
She wants to talk to me?
What does she...?
Holy mackerel.
Hello, Miss Paine. How are you?
Yes.
Fine.
What?
What? Escort you?
I'd be delighted.
All right.
Reception for a princess?
She wants me to...
Goodbye, Miss Paine.
Goodbye.
What do you know? A reception for a princess.
- Can you imagine?
- Get your hat.
We have a lot of shopping to do before tomorrow.
Where are your bitters?
In the thing there. Behind the thing.
I don't mind who gets licked in a fair fight.
It's these clouts below the belt I can't take.
Siccing that horrible dame on him when he's goofy about her.
What dame?
Paine.
Better be nice to her.
Her dad's the party choice for the White House.
She may be the next First Lady of the land.
Imagine reading "My Day" by Susan "Paine-In-The-Neck."
He isn't going to be hurt enough. She has to twist a knife in him too.
The regal jackass.
"I'll turn my glamour on him," she says.
What's it to you?
Nothing. I'm just saying...
Then stop worrying.
I told you, the dopes will inherit the earth.
I wonder if this Don Quixote hasn't got the jump on all of us.
If it isn't a curse to go through life wised up like you and me.
If you're going to wonder, let's go down and do it over a steak.
Come on, snap out of it. Drink up!
Here's to bigger and better dopes.
And to Don Quixote.
Do you know how I felt?
How did you feel? Quick.
I felt just like a mother.
Sending her kid off to school for the first time.
Watching the little fellow toddling off in his best bib and tucker.
Hoping he can stand up to the other kids.
Say, who started this?
I'm just waiting for a streetcar.
Well, cut it out, see?
Who cares, anyway?
I apologize.
All right, then.
After all, what's it to me? So they drop him out of a balloon.
All I care is, I don't want to be around.
I'm squeamish, see? That's what I am.
No, sir.
I don't have to take it. I won't be party to murder.
I'm going to quit. I'm through.
Again? It's a good idea.
Let's get married.
It's a good idea.
When?
Anytime.
Tonight?
You don't mind?
I'd cherish you.
You're a good egg, Diz.
I know.
Maybe we could clear out of this town.
Get to feel like people.
Live like we just got out of a tunnel.
- Tunnel?
- A tunnel.
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
Does the wind get tired out there?
Or angry little mountain streams or the sun moving against the cattle?
You've never seen anything like that, have you, Diz?
Have you?
Do we have to?
I can't think of anything more sappy.
Then let's get going.
Where?
We're getting married.
That's right.
In case you don't know, I want to give you a chance to back out.
What?
My first name's Clarissa.
I know. It's okay.
Don't say "okay." Say you think it's beautiful.
Okay. I mean...
You don't know any name offhand that you like better, do you?
Not offhand.
Nothing like "Susan" or anything?
Susan?
I won't take it, see?
I won't be party to murder, see?
Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that Taylor mob is low enough but helping that dame cut him in little bits nobody's going to make me do that!
You said it.
I'm going to get out of there right now. Right now.
Bonus or no bonus. I'm clearing out.
Everything I own. My extra hat, everything.
Wait a minute.
We're getting married!
See you later.
Saunders?
What do you want?
- You should have been there.
- I know.
It was a wonderful party, and your suit went over big and she looked beautiful.
And when you left she said "Thank you, Mr. Smith."
But it was the way she said it. You nearly fell through the floor.
Horseradish.
What are you looking at? You didn't think I was a lady, did you?
A lady wouldn't work for this outfit.
Even I can't take it anymore. I quit.
There's a lot I can't take.
Can't take a simple...
Why don't you go home?
Tell your little streams about your camp and the land of the free.
This is no place for you. You're halfway decent.
Now go home!
That's all I wanted to tell you.
Meet the man I'm going to marry.
That's me.
Say something. Don't just stand there like a...
Wait a minute.
Why don't I do this right?
So you want to be a senator? Build a camp on Willet Creek?
See this?
Deficiency bill.
Section 40. A dam going up where you think your camp will be.
Ever hear of it?
They read about it in the Senate today, but you didn't hear.
That's why that ritzy dame took you in tow.
That's why they sent you here. You don't know a dam from a bathtub.
Go ahead. Be a senator.
Try and mess up Mr. Taylor's little graft.
But if you can't and you can't in 9 million years...
Go home! Don't stay around here making people feel sorry for you.
Come on, Diz.
Hey! This way.
Come on, kid. We'll dig up a preacher.
We're going to get married.
Come on, I'll take you home.
There are 100 other places in the state that really need the water.
Kenneth Allen owns some land there. He didn't mention a dam.
There's something wrong here. I know there is.
I won't vote on it till I get some questions answered.
- Jeff, you're fighting windmills.
- I am?
Trying to understand everything about a project that took two years to set up.
- The reasons, the benefits.
- The benefits? Who is Taylor?
What's he got to do with this?
What makes you think he's got anything to do with it?
I've heard that this is all his idea to get graft.
Do you know what you're saying?
You're accusing me of framing a bill for one individual's benefit.
Of helping to put through a scheme for graft.
Long distance?
Get me James Taylor, Jackson City.
Boy Ranger, eh? Answer to a prayer? Manna from heaven.
Didn't even know how to tell time.
Will you tell me exactly what he's done?
He's about to blow the machine to smithereens, and you with it.
Me, Jim? How?
You wouldn't understand that.
Listen to me, Mr. Ten-Thumbs, I'm on my way to Washington.
No matter what happens, I'm all ready for that Boy Ranger of yours.
Take your instructions from Ken Allen.
I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp.
Use your high office to help Alan get things done.
Do you understand?
I doubt it. Come on, Alan.
I haven't been able to show him a single monument. Not even one that high.
No, he's been on our tail. You've got to keep this guy off of us.
Ever since he found out we represent the Creek, he's been running us ragged.
I told you I'd handle him. I object to you coming here like this.
You proved how you can handle him.
You're the one that started him writing bills.
Chick, let him in.
- You didn't ask Smith here?
What do you think?
Don't open that door. Jim, you can't do this.
Let him in, Chick.
All right, Jim.
You can count me out.
Good morning, senator. Come right in.
What did you mean, count you out?
You can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff.
Your methods won't do here.
He's a senator. However it happened, he's a senator.
This is Washington.
Steamroller stuff? My methods don't go in Washington?
They've done well by you.
That's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest.
He thinks the world of me. We can't do it!
What am I supposed to do?
Stand around and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck?
Not me.
Either he falls in line with us or I'll break him so wide open they'll never find the pieces.
Jim, I won't stand for it.
You won't stand for it?
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
I see.
Our steamroller methods are too hard for your sensitive soul. Is that it?
The Silver Knight is getting too big for us.
My methods have been all right for the past 20 years.
Since I picked you out of a flyspecked hole-in-the-wall and made you look like a senator.
And now you can't stand it?
Maybe you don't have to stand it.
Maybe we can fix it so you and the boy can go home together.
- You don't have to...
- It's all right, it's all right.
Seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years.
Especially now, with a national convention coming up.
Joe, I put everything I have behind you.
And so did all of our friends.
I guess we'll survive.
We'll just find somebody else who's got a little more sense.
In the meantime, you go in and explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam.
It's your bill. It's your reputation.
If he can't find enough facts to break you with send him to me.
I'll give him a couple of good ones.
I'm taking the next plane home. So long.
Come here, will you?
It's just that I like the kid.
I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
I'm glad you came to your senses.
You had me scared there for a minute.
Go back to your office. I'll call you when I get through with Smith.
"The Silver Knight."
Hello, senator.
I was just passing through. I thought I'd like to meet you.
Sit down. You met all the boys here, I suppose.
They say you've been on your toes since you got here.
That's fine.
You know, some people told me that you were dumb.
I think you're smart.
You're smart enough to understand a situation...
- ...when it's explained to you.
- Like what?
Well, for instance building a dam on Willet Creek.
Just what's your interest in this?
What's my interest?
Anything that benefits the state is mighty important to me.
Owning a lot of its industry, newspapers and other odds and ends.
If I felt you had the welfare of the state at heart like I have I'd say you were a man to watch.
Now, what do you like?
Business?
If you do, you can pick any job in the state and go to the top.
Or politics.
If you like being senator, there's no reason why you can't come back and stay there as long as you want.
If you're smart.
Now, you take the boys here, or Joe Paine.
They're doing all right.
They don't have to worry about being re-elected or anything else.
They're smart.
They take my advice.
You tell these men and Senator Paine what to do?
Why, yes.
Joe Paine has been taking my advice for the past 20 years.
You're a liar.
I've got to see Senator Paine.
Senator Paine is out of town.
Out of town? He couldn't be.
Hello, Jeff. Come in.
Did you have a talk with Taylor?
He said he's told you what to do for 20 years.
I called him a liar.
Come over here and sit down.
I don't feel like sitting down.
Oh, I know how you feel.
I was hoping you'd be spared all this.
I was hoping that you would see the sights, absorb some history, and go back to your boys.
You've been living in a boy's world. For heaven's sake, stay there.
This is a man's world.
It's brutal, and you've no place in it.
You'll only get hurt. Take my advice. Forget Taylor and what he said.
Forget you ever heard of Willet Creek Dam.
But you still haven't answered me, sir.
Can a man like Taylor tell you and those other men what to do?
Listen, Jeff, please and try to understand.
I know it's tough to run head-on into facts.
This is a man's world, and you got to check your ideals outside the door, like you do your rubbers.
Now, 30 years ago I had your ideals.
I was you.
I had to make the same decision you were asked to make today.
And I made it.
I compromised.
So I could sit in that Senate and serve the people in 1000 honest ways.
You got to face facts.
I've served our state well, haven't I?
We have the lowest unemployment and the highest federal grants.
But I've had to compromise.
I've had to play ball. You can't count on people voting.
Half the time they don't vote, anyway.
That's how states and empires have been built since time began, understand?
You can take my word for it. That's how things are.
I've told you all this because I've grown very fond of you.
About like a son, in fact.
And I don't want to see you get hurt.
When that deficiency bill comes up tomorrow, don't say a word.
Great powers are behind it, who'll destroy you before you start.
For your own sake and for the sake of my friendship with your father please don't say a word.
Owing to the urgency of the deficiency bill there is a unanimous consent agreement that no one will speak more than once or longer than five minutes on any section of the bill.
Clerk will read.
"The bill for deficiency appropriations for the fiscal year, Section One.
On emergency relief:
To create and erect public improvements on rivers harbors and roadways, $150 billion.
Section 40:
An appropriation to divert and impound Willet Creek to the natural basin of Terry Canyon, $5 million."
Mr. President?
Senator Smith desires to be heard on Section 40?
I do, sir.
The senator understands he's limited to five minutes?
Yes, sir.
You may proceed, sir.
Mr. President, this section of the bill, this dam on Willet Creek is nothing but...
Does Senator Smith wish to yield to his colleague?
Why, yes, sir.
You may proceed, senator.
Mr. President I have risen to a difficult task to say from evidence that has come to my attention I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body.
You boys go out and get the senators.
Something going on inside, come on.
The senator will suspend until order is restored.
All senators are wanted on the floor, please.
What's going on?
- I don't know.
You may proceed.
I refer to the bill he has introduced for the creation of a national boys' camp.
He named a portion of land to be dedicated to that purpose and to be bought by contributions from boys all over America.
Senators I have evidence to prove my colleague owns the land described in his bill.
He bought it the day after his appointment to the Senate and is holding it using his privileged office for his own personal profit!
Boy Ranger had a wreck.
This doesn't make sense.
Accordingly I offer a resolution an inquiry by the Committee of Privileges and Elections as to the fitness of my colleague to continue to sit in this chamber.
Order!
Chairman, clear the galleries unless order is restored.
Flash! Ranger senator branded by colleague.
Flash! Paine brings charges to expel Smith.
Where's Saunders?
- She'll have the lowdown.
I wish I knew. She left town in that jalopy of hers.
Paine accuses Smith of introducing a boys' camp built for his own profit.
Give me a cigarette.
Paine's asked for a hearing before the Committee.
Well, frankly, my dear senators the morning that Mr. Allen burst into my office bringing proof that Smith had the deed to that campsite I was dumbfounded!
Pardon me, what did you do when this was brought to your attention?
I consulted with the head of the Department of Records Mr. Arthur Kim.
Mr. Kim, do you remember recording such a deed?
On the date set forth here, Mr. Allen came before me to record this deed setting over 200 acres in the name of Jefferson Smith.
How long have you known Senator Smith, Mr. Allen?
Oh, a good many years.
He used my land by Willet Creek every summer for his Boy Rangers.
Seemed like a mighty nice fellow.
One day he made a proposition.
Said he had a chance to sell that land for at least $500 an acre.
I'd be glad to get 25 for it. So we set it up like this:
I deeded him the land, and he gave me a contract guaranteeing me half, if he made the sale.
Mind you now the whole thing sounded fishy at the time.
That contract you mentioned have you got it?
That land wouldn't be in his name if I didn't.
Yes, sir. Signed and delivered.
I never signed any such contract!
He certainly did!
Just a moment, please.
After a long study of this signature, it is my professional opinion that it is definitely in Jefferson Smith's own handwriting.
As an expert on handwriting I'd say the name of Jefferson Smith on this contract has been forged.
I would stake my whole 20 years professional career on the fact that this is not a forgery but is Mr. Smith's own signature.
This is a very painful duty for me.
This boy's the son of my very best friend.
I sponsored him in the Senate. I helped frame his bill.
When he presented it, I went to congratulate him but pointed out a dam was already going up on the very site he'd chosen for his camp.
There are other good campsites nearby so I suggested he choose another.
He became furious.
He said, "Move the dam."
I was amazed at his violent reaction. I couldn't understand.
Until the evidence came to me that he owned those very 200 acres.
And as you have heard had carefully laid plans to make an enormous profit out of the nickels and dimes scraped together by the boys of this country.
Faced with that regardless of my personal feelings for the boy my sense of duty told me his expulsion from the Senate was the only possible answer.
Beautiful, that Taylor machine.
Senator Smith, please.
Will you take the chair, please?
The Committee is ready to hear you now, Senator Smith.
Keep your seats, gentlemen!
Committee is not adjourned yet.
Quiet! Please!
That Ranger never knew what struck him when Jim Taylor opened up on him.
Which one of you girls wants this?
- Do you want it?
- Oh, yes.
You know, I had a hunch I'd find you here when you weren't anyplace else.
How've you been, Saunders?
Oh, all right.
Your husband. How's he?
Old Diz. We're not married.
Good thing I got back just when I did. You know what I found waiting for me?
Jar of preserves from your mother.
Oh, you did?
What was it, strawberry?
That's the best kind.
I see by the papers you certainly got to be a senator.
You sure had the right idea about me, Saunders.
You told me to go back home and keep filling those kids full of hooey.
Just a simple guy, you said, still wet behind the ears lot of junk about American ideals.
That's certainly a lot of junk, all right.
- Now look, senator...
- I don't know this is a whole new world to me.
What are you going to believe in when a man like Senator Joseph Paine gets up and swears that I've been robbing kids of nickels and dimes?
A man I've admired and worshiped all my life.
I don't know.
A lot of fancy words in this town.
Some of them are carved in stone, some of them....
Guess the Taylors and Paines put them up there so suckers like me can read them.
Then when you find out what men actually do....
Well, I'm getting out of this town so fast away from all the words and the monuments and the whole rotten show.
I see.
When you get home, what will you tell those kids?
Well, I'll tell them the truth.
Might as well find it out now as later.
I don't think they'll believe you.
They're liable to look up at you with hurt faces and say "Jeff, what did you do?
Didn't you do something about it?"
Well, what do you expect me to do?
An honorary stooge like me against the Taylors and Paines and machines and lies.
Your friend Mr. Lincoln had his Taylors and Paines.
So did every other man who tried to lift his thought up off the ground.
Odds against them didn't stop them, they were fools that way.
All the good that ever came into this world came from fools with faith like that.
You can't quit now. Not you.
They aren't all Taylors and Paines in Washington.
That kind just throw big shadows, that's all.
You didn't just have faith in Paine, or any other living man.
You had faith in something bigger.
You had plain, decent, everyday common rightness and this country could use some of that.
So could the whole cockeyed world. A lot of it.
Remember the first day you got here?
Remember what you said about Mr. Lincoln?
That he was waiting for someone to come along?
You were right.
He was waiting for a man who could see his job and sail into it.
Who could tear into the Taylors and root them out into the open.
I think he was waiting for you.
He knows you can do it. So do I.
What? Do what, Saunders?
You make up your mind you won't quit, and I'll tell you what.
Been thinking about it all the way back here.
It's a 40-foot dive into a tub of water, but I think you can do it.
Clarissa where can we get a drink?
Now you're talking.
Come on over to my place.
Mr. Dearborn.
Mr. Dernell.
Mr. Dwight.
They're going to expel Smith today, eh?
Where are the drums? Where's the guillotine?
In fact, where's Smith?
Hasn't stopped running since he left the Committee.
- Mr. Singleton. - Here.
Mr. Smith.
Here!
That guy's batty.
The clerk will continue with the roll call.
Here comes Saunders.
Is this some of your shenanigan?
What's the matter?
Pray, Diz, if you know how.
Did you have anything to do with bringing him in here?
Are you crazy?
Ninety senators have answered to their names.
Quorum is present.
Proceeding now to the regular order.
Mr. President.
Senator MacPherson.
I desire to call up the report of the Committee on the expulsion of Jefferson Smith.
Clerk will read the report.
"The Committee on Privileges and Elections reports it appears to the satisfaction of the Committee after hearing a number of witnesses that justice requires that Smith no longer continue a member of this body.
They report this resolution with recommendation that the same do pass.
Resolved:
That Jefferson Smith be expelled from his seat in the Senate."
I move for the immediate adoption of the resolution.
- I addressed the chair first.
- I have the floor.
I'm asking for a roll call on the passage of the resolution without further delay.
The senator can have nothing to say that would not...
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this body and has an equal claim on the attention of this chair.
You were about to recognize me.
That was merely your impression.
Let him speak!
Before proceeding further I remind the visitors in the gallery they are here as our guests and should conduct themselves as such.
And I might add that their sentiments in no way will affect the judgement of this chair.
The chair recognizes Senator Smith.
Thank you, sir.
Diz, here we go.
I guess the gentlemen are in a big hurry to get me out of here.
The way the evidence is piled up against me, I can't blame them much.
And I'm willing to go when they vote it that way but before that happens, I've got a few things to say.
I tried to say them once before and I got stopped colder than a mackerel.
I'd like to get them said this time.
I'm not going to leave until I do get them said.
Will the senator yield?
- Senator yields?
- No, sir, I'm afraid not!
No, sir.
I yielded the floor once before, and I was practically never heard of again.
No, sir.
And we might as well all get together on this "yielding" business right off the bat now.
I had some pretty good coaching last night and I find that if I yield only for a question or point of order or personal privilege, that I can hold this floor almost until doomsday.
In other words, I've got a piece to speak and blow hot or cold, I'm going to speak it.
Will the senator yield?
Will Senator Smith yield?
- Yield how?
Will he yield for a question? - All right.
I wish to ask my junior colleague this piece he intends to speak does it concern Section 40 of that bill, the dam on Willet Creek?
Every aspect of this matter, everything was dealt with in committee hearings.
- Mr. President?
- I ask my distinguished colleague has he one scrap of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give and could not give at that same hearing?
I have no defense against forged papers!
The committee ruled otherwise!
The gentleman stands guilty as charged.
And I believe I speak for every member when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about any section of any legislation before this House!
- Order, order, gentleman!
- Mr. President I stand guilty as framed because Section 40 is graft.
And I was ready to say so.
I was ready to tell you that a certain man in my state, Mr. James Taylor wanted to put through this dam for his own profit.
A man who controls a political machine and controls everything else in my state.
A man even powerful enough to control congressmen.
I saw three of them in his room the day I went to see him.
Will the senator yield?
- I will not yield!
This same man, James Taylor, came down here and offered me a seat in this Senate for the next 20 years if I voted for a dam that he knew and I knew was a fraud but if I dared to open my mouth against that dam he promised to break me in two.
I got up here and I started to open my mouth and the long and powerful arm of Mr. Taylor reached into this sacred chamber and grabbed me by the scruff of the neck...
Mr. President, a point of order.
Mr. President?
Senator Paine will state it.
It was I who rose in this chamber to accuse him.
He's saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence.
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a senator, and I demand that he yield the floor.
I did not say that Senator Paine was one of the congressmen in that room!
I was in that room!
Order, gentlemen.
I accuse this man.
By his tone, by his careful denials he is trying to plant damaging impressions on my conduct.
I'll tell you why we were in that room.
Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our state had brought with him the evidence against this man and we were urging him to resign.
To avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable state.
But he refused!
Mr. President...
There is only one answer to a man like him.
The truth, which I rose and gave to this body.
Mr. President he is trying to blackmail this Senate as he tried to blackmail me.
To prevent his expulsion, he'll even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill, vital to the country which must be passed immediately!
Have I the floor?
I have lost all patience with this brazen character.
I apologize to this body for his appointment.
I regret I ever knew him.
I'm sick of this contemptible young man.
And I refuse to stay here and listen to him any longer.
I hope every member of this body feels as I do.
Get off the floor! Yield the floor!
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, please address the chair!
Mr. President, what does the gentleman want of this body?
I'll tell you, sir!
I want a chance to talk to people who'll believe me.
The people of my state, they know me and they know Mr. Taylor.
When they hear my story, they'll rise up and kick Taylor's machine to kingdom come.
I want one week to go back there and bring you proof.
In the meantime, I want this Senate's promise that I won't be expelled and this bill will not be passed.
Will the senator yield?
- For a question.
Has the gentleman the effrontery to stand, convicted and in disgrace and try to force postponement of the Deficiency Bill?
- For one week.
- Mr. President!
I appeal to the senator.
Is he fully aware that this bill has been months in both Houses delayed and delayed?
Millions will be without food and shelter.
Public works will be at a standstill!
Will we keep relief from the country?
The people of my state need permanent relief from crooked men riding their backs!
Mr. President, if the Senate yields to this sort to blackmail, it'll become a laughingstock.
It is an insult to this body to have to listen.
An insult to our colleague, Senator Paine.
I, for one, will follow the senator's example and refuse to remain in this chamber as long as that man holds the floor!
Order, gentlemen!
I guess I'll have to speak to the people of my state from right here!
I'll tell you wild horses won't drag me off this floor until those people have heard everything I've got to say, if it takes all winter!
Filibuster!
Well, Mr. President, we seem to be alone.
I'm not complaining for social reason, it's just....
I think it'd be a pity if these gentlemen missed any of this. And....
I call the chair's attention to to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate.
Section... Section Three.
"If it shall be found that a quorum is not present a majority of the senators present..."
And that looks like me.
"...may direct the sergeant at arms to request, and if necessary...
Well, Mr. President, I so direct.
The absence of a quorum being suggested.
- Bring the call to quorum.
- Call to quorum.
There's no hurry, Mr. President. I got plenty of time.
Quorum call! Call to quorum!
All senators wanted on the floor!
Clerk will call the roll.
- Mr. Agnew. - Here.
Mr. Albert.
Mr. Alfred.
- Mr. Ashman. - Here.
Joe, get this! Smith got the floor and is holding it.
Just as they were about to kick him out!
He did it, Diz. It's wonderful!
It was terrific!
A filibuster! This is the miracle I wanted. What a yarn!
Get everything he says back to that home state.
It's a pleasure!
They're going to hear this in Patagonia.
In protest, the whole Senate body walked out!
Not that straight stuff. Kick it up.
Get on his side. Fight for him, understand?
You love this monkey, don't you?
What do you think? Now go to work. Do as I tell you.
Take this:
This is the most titanic battle of modern times.
A David without even a slingshot rises to battle against the mighty Goliath, the Taylor machine allegedly crooked inside and out.
For my money you can drop the "allegedly."
We're bringing everybody up from headquarters.
Where are they? Come on, get these telegraphs moving!
- You get Hendricks? - They're looking for him.
"They're looking for him." An editor.
Why isn't he at his desk, where he belongs?
Don't you think you better get back to that Senate?
The boy's talking to that state.
If he can raise public opinion against us...
He'll never get started.
I'll make public opinion within 5 hours. I've done it all my life.
I'll blacken this punk so....
Leave public opinion to me.
Now, go back into the Senate and keep those senators lined up.
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew.
I haven't got the stomach for it anymore.
If he convinces those senators, you might as well blow your brains out.
This is the works, Joe!
Either we're out of business or we're bigger than ever.
We can't stop at anything until we smash this yokel...
Hendricks on the phone.
Go back to the Senate, will you?
Hello, Hendricks. Well, the chips are down.
Keep everything that Smith says, or any other pro-Smith stuff out of all our newspapers.
And all the others you can line up in the state.
Those broken-down opposition papers, who won't play ball with us I want you to tie up for 24 hours.
Stall their deliveries. Push them off the street. I don't care!
Bury them for 24 hours. That'll give me plenty of time.
And you defend the machine. Hit this guy!
The usual thing. Criminal, and blocking a relief bill and starving the people.
Joe, will you get back into that Senate?
And Hendricks, get the hoi polloi excited.
Have them send protest letters, wires, anything you like.
Buy every minute you can of every radio station in the state and keep them spouting against Smith.
I don't care what it costs. Pay out. Get moving.
Get the whole state moving!
This filibuster is a cowardly attempt to turn your attention from the true facts which are beyond question.
Jefferson Smith was caught red-handed, stealing from boys.
Relief will be stopped. Men thrown out of jobs.
- I've seen filibustering, but...
- Smith can't go on. It's ridiculous.
We've got to get him off the floor.
As long as Mr. Smith holds that floor legitimately he's going to continue to hold it.
If you ask me, that fellow's making sense. Sense?
You call blackmail sense, Henry?
Joe, I didn't like this boy from the beginning.
But we feel that no man who wasn't sincere could fight like this against these odds.
I'm very glad to know that, Martin.
After 20 years, I'm very glad to know you'd take his word against mine.
Yes, that's what it means!
If he's that much right, then I'm wrong.
Joe, can't we work out some deal to pull that Willet Dam out and let the Deficiency Bill go through?
It isn't a question of Willet Dam.
It's a question of my honor and reputation.
The integrity of the Committee, the integrity of the Senate itself.
If you want to throw out Section 40, go ahead.
- I'll resign. - Now, wait a minute, Joe.
This is a lot of nonsense.
Joe's right. A deal is impossible.
We've got to go on with this.
Break him, keep him talking.
No relief. Maintain a quorum in relays.
- ls that how you feel, John? - For once, I agree with you.
It's time to relieve the floor.
How a man that green knows as much as he does....
Can't go on much longer.
"...that they're entitled by their creator with certain inalienable rights and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of..."
Well, looks like the night shift's coming on.
Senator will please suspend until order is restored.
This is H.V. Coltenborn speaking.
Half of official Washington is here to see democracy's finest show the filibuster:
The right to talk your head off.
The American privilege of free speech in its most dramatic form.
The least man in that chamber once he gets and holds that floor, by the rules can hold it and talk as long as he can stand on his feet.
Providing always that he does not sit down and that he does not leave the chamber or stop talking.
The galleries are packed.
In the diplomatic gallery are the envoys of two dictator powers.
They have come here to see what they can't see at home democracy in action.
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it." "...
How am I doing?
- Quit stalling and move!
- Clark, Jim.
- Oh, Clark...
- Mr. Taylor?
Yes, wait a minute
Phone Senator Paine about it.
This is Jim Taylor in Washington.
About this Smith filibuster.
Newspapers in the Southwest must realize that this bill he's trying to block will affect your section as well as any.
It's the patriotic duty of every newspaper...
Wait a minute. Yes?
- Jackson City calling.
- Hold them!
We've got to keep hammering at this man until we smash him!
I get a great kick out of that part of the Declaration of Independence.
You're not going to have a country that can make these rules work if you haven't got men that have learned to tell human rights from a punch in the nose.
That's good for a headline.
It's a funny thing about men, you know.
They all start life being boys I wouldn't be surprised if these senators were boys once.
That's why it seemed like a good idea to get the boys out of crowded cities and stuffy basements for a couple of months out of the year and build their bodies and minds for a man-sized job because they're going to be behind these desks someday.
It seemed like a good idea, getting boys from all over the country boys of all nationalities and ways of living.
Getting them together let them find out what makes different people tick.
Because I wouldn't give you 2 cents for all your rules if behind them they didn't have a little ordinary everyday kindness and a little looking out for the other fellow too.
That's pretty important, all that.
It's just the blood and bone and sinew of this democracy that some great men handed down to the human race, that's all!
But if you've got to build a dam where that boys' camp ought to be to pay off some political army, that's a different thing.
If you think I'm going back and tell those boys in my state "Fellows, forget about it.
All I've been telling you about the land you live in is a lot of hooey.
This isn't your country. It belongs to a lot of James Taylors." No, not me.
Anybody here that thinks I'd do that, they got another thing coming!
I just wanted to find out if you still had faces.
Oh, I'm sorry, gentlemen.
I know I'm being disrespectful to this honorable body.
A guy like me should never be allowed to get in here in the first place.
And I hate to stand here and try your patience like this, but I...
Either I'm dead right or I'm crazy!
You wouldn't care to put that to a vote, would you, senator?
Will the senator yield for a question?
- I yield.
In view of the gentlemen's touching concern for the senators and the fact that he's been talking for 7 1/2 hours and must be very, very tired would he permit a motion to recess until the morning at which time he may better continue with his profound babblings.
No. No, don't!
Ask him!
Mr. President, what happens in the morning I mean, about my having this floor to go on with my "babblings"?
If the senator permits this motion for a recess he won't have the floor in the morning to babble with or anything else unless he is recognized first by this chair.
As I was saying, gentlemen I'm either dead right or I'm crazy and I feel fine.
What have you got, Dick?
- From Miss Saunders.
Is the senator yielding the floor?
Yield? Oh, no!
I feel fine!
The Constitution of the United States.
Page one, top left-hand corner.
"We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union...."
Yeah? Well, buy it or wreck it!
Brady's column too? Holy smokes!
What's the matter?
This is murder, you got to call him off.
- He's getting nowhere.
What are you talking about?
Not one word of what he says is being printed in that state.
Oh, no!
Taylor has practically every paper in the state lined up and he's feeding them doctored-up junk!
- One man muzzling a whole state?
- And how!
Freedom of the press!
Wait a minute! I've got an idea!
Jeff has a paper there, Boy Stuff, right?
Terrific!
They aren't letting what Jeff says get printed in the state.
If I give you a raft over the phone now...
Write me a front-page raft, Diz.
Can you print it out and spread a billion copies of it?
Swell!
Get ready to take it down, will you, Mrs. Smith?
All right.
Boys, everything about Jeff. Get pencils and paper, quick!
All right, here we go!
All ready, Clarissa.
She called me Clarissa!
Okay, Ma!
"Jeff Tells Truth.
Shows Up Taylor."
I want the whole morning edition. Push him off the floor!
Start your campaign for protests. Wired!
"Willet Dam is a fraud to line the pockets of the Taylor machine."
Here's your front-page editorial. Wait!
"A convicted thief representing you holds the floor of the United States Senate."
All right, boys. Hurry up!
She said rush! Get cracking now!
Come on! Bring on the paper!
"...charity wanteth not itself is not propped up and now abideth faith hope, charity these three.
The greatest of these is charity."
Read about Jeff.
Boy's Stuff circulars. Peddled by 9 million kids.
What are you standing there for? Get the boys out! Kill it!
Get these papers out of here.
Read all about it! Jeff Smith lies in Senate!
Wire Congress!
Are we going to let a man like Jeff throw mud at a man like Joe Paine?
Are you for Joe Paine?
Hurray for Jeff Smith!
Children hurt all over the city.
Tell Jeff to stop!
Yes, all right.
Goodbye.
"Senator Smith has now talked for 23 hours and 16 minutes.
It's the most unusual and spectacular thing in the Senate annuls.
One lone and simple American holding the greatest floor in the land.
What he lacked in experience, he's made up in fight.
But those tired Boy Ranger legs are buckling.
Bleary-eyed, voice gone.
He can't go on much longer.
And all official Washington is here to be in on the kill."
There's no compromise with truth.
That's all I got up on this floor to say.
When was it?
A year ago, it seems like.
Terrible things are happening. I've got to stop him.
They're listening to him. Anything might happen now.
Just get up off the ground. That's all I ask.
Get up there with that lady that's on top of this Capitol dome.
That lady that stands for liberty.
Look at this country through her eyes if you want to see something.
But you won't just see scenery.
You'll see the whole parade of what man's carved out for himself after centuries of fighting.
Fighting for something better than just jungle law.
Fighting so he can stand on his own two feet, free and decent like he was created.
No matter what his race, color or creed.
That's what you'd see.
There's no place out there for graft or greed or lies or compromise with human liberties.
If that's what the grownups have done with this world we better get those boys' camps started fast and see what the kids can do.
It's not too late.
Because this country is bigger than the Taylors or you or me or anything else!
Great principles don't get lost once they come to light.
They're right here!
You just have to see them again.
Mr. President.
Will the senator yield for a question?
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Yes, I yield for a question.
The senator has said he is speaking to the people of his state.
He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it for them to come marching here in droves.
Would the gentlemen be interested in what those people have to say?
Here it comes.
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Mr. President.
Have I permission to bring in evidence of the response of my state?
Is there objection?
You may proceed, senator.
Pageboys!
I can't stand it. I can't stand to see him hurt like this.
Public opinion made to order.
Taylor-made.
There it is. There's the gentleman's answer.
Telegrams. 50,000 of them demanding that he yield this floor.
I invite the Senate to read them.
I invite my colleague to read them.
The people's answer to Mr. Jefferson Smith.
Stop, Jeff! Stop!
I guess this is just another lost cause, Mr. Paine.
All you people don't know about lost causes.
Mr. Paine does.
He said once they were the only causes worth fighting for.
He fought for them once.
For the only reason that any man ever fights for them.
Because of just one plain, simple rule:
Love thy neighbor.
In this world today full of hatred a man who knows that one rule has a great trust.
You know that rule, Mr. Paine.
And I loved you for it, just as my father did.
And you know you fight for lost causes harder than for any others.
Yes, you even die for them.
Like a man we both knew, Mr. Paine.
You think I'm licked.
You all think I'm licked!
Well, I'm not licked!
I'm going to stay right here and fight for this lost cause!
Even if this room gets filled with lies like these and the Taylors and all their armies come marching into this place.
Somebody will listen to me.
He's okay. He just fainted.
- Let me go!
What's the matter, Joe?
I'm not fit to be a senator! I'm not fit to live!
Expel me!
Expel me, not him!
Willy Taylor's a fraud!
It's a crime against the people who sent me here and I committed it!
Every word that boy said is the truth!
Every word about Taylor and me and graft and the rotten political corruption in my state!
Every word of it is true! I'm not fit for office!
I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust!
Expel me, not that boy!
We did it! We did it!
Order gentlemen! Please!
He did it!
Let go of me!
Yippee!
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
No.
Yes, monsieur?
Just looking around.
Comrades, why should we lie to each other?
It's wonderful.
Let's be honest.
Have we anything like it in Russia?
No.
Can you imagine what the beds would be in a hotel like that?
They tell me when you ring once, the valet comes in.
When you ring twice, you get a waiter.
And do you know what happens when you ring three times?
A maid comes in, a French maid.
Comrades, if we ring nine times... Let's go in.
Just a minute.
I have nothing against the idea, but I still say... let's go back to the Hotel Terminus.
Moscow made our reservations there.
We are on an official mission... and we have no right to change the orders of our superiors.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades?
And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
I don't want to go to Siberia.
And I don't want to go to Hotel Terminus.
And I don't want to...
- No. - Listen to me.
Look, Buljanoff, if Lenin were alive, he would say:
"Buljanoff, comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris.
"Don't be a fool.
Go in there and ring three times."
He wouldn't say that.
What he would say is:
"You can't afford to live in a cheap hotel.
"Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you?
"Do you want to live in a hotel...
"where you press for the hot water and cold water comes...
"and when you press for cold water, nothing comes at all?"
Phooey, Buljanoff.
I still say our place is with the common people.
But who am I to contradict Lenin? Let's go in.
- Are you the manager?
- Yes, monsieur.
Pardon me for introducing Comrade Iranoff...
- member of the Russian Board of Trade.
- Monsieur.
- This is Comrade Kopalski. - Monsieur.
- And I am Comrade Buljanoff. - Monsieur.
May I ask you how much your rooms are?
Gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Why should you be afraid?
I might be able to accommodate you.
- Is there some more luggage?
- Yes.
But have you a safe big enough to hold this?
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in the vault...
- but there's a suite with a private safe. - That's even better.
- But, gentlemen, I'm afraid... - He's always afraid.
I just wanted to explain.
The apartment may suit your convenience... but I doubt whether it will fit your convictions.
- It's the Royal Suite. - The Royal Suite?
Just a minute.
Comrades, I warn you, if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite... we'll get into terrible trouble.
We'll tell them we had to do it on account of the safe.
That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
- That's right. - That's fine.
Of course, we could take out the pieces... and distribute them in three or four boxes in the vault... and take a small room.
- That's an idea, isn't it?
- Yes, that's an idea.
But who said we had to have an idea?
- That's right. - That's very good.
- Give us the Royal Suite. - Step this way, please.
Hello.
Please connect me with Mercier. Yes, the jeweler.
Hello?
No, I want to speak to Monsieur Mercier personally.
Yes.
Hello, Monsieur Mercier?
This is Iranoff, Member of the Russian Board of Trade.
Yes, we arrived this morning.
Thank you very much.
Yes, we have everything here.
The necklace, too.
All 14 pieces, at the... What?
No, Monsieur Mercier.
The court jewels of the Grand Duchess Swana consisted of 14 pieces.
Why don't you check on that?
Of course, we have all the necessary credentials.
Take care of the Royal Suite. I'll be back in 10 minutes.
- All right, Rakonin. - Thank you very much.
- 8 rue de Chalon. - Bien, monsieur.
- Hello, Leon. - Good morning, Swana, darling.
It's really a wretched morning. I can't get myself right.
I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle.
My face doesn't compose well. It's all highlights.
How can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something.
I'm so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face.
Whose face would you have if you had your choice?
I guess one gets the face one deserves.
There's one marvelous advantage to your composition.
However many questions you ask, you never expect an answer.
Don't you find that restful?
- Good morning, darling. - Good morning.
- Why didn't you come last night? - I was looking after your interests.
Did you win?
We can forget horse racing, roulette, everything.
Our worries are over.
You remember the platinum watch with the diamond numbers?
You'll be in a position to give it to me now.
Darling, you're so good to me.
We could be rich, if you say the word.
- I had dinner with the Guizots last night. - Those awful newspaper people.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with them.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press.
I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs...
- in the Gazette Parisienne. - What?
'The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia. '
We won't have to worry about our future if you're willing to raffle off your past.
Come in.
Count Rakonin asks the privilege of a few words, Your Highness.
- Rakonin?
- He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil.
- You know him. - Yes.
Tell him I won't be able to see him for half an hour.
The Count says if it could be as soon as possible.
It's luncheon time, and he is between courses.
All right, I'll see him right away.
- I can't get myself right today... - Count Rakonin's between courses.
My little Volga boatman.
- How do you do, my friend? Won't you sit?
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness, forgive this intrusion... - Have you lost your job?
No, madame.
Something of the utmost importance.
- It concerns your jewels. - My jewels?
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar...
I had the honor of being on guard at his palace.
I still see you bending before His Majesty.
You wore your diadem and a necklace.
But why do you bring this up now?
They are here. Your jewels, here in Paris.
Alexis, do you know what you're saying?
This morning, three Soviet agents arrived.
I overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier, the jeweler.
- They're going to sell them. - Did I hear something about jewels?
Rakonin has just given me the most amazing news.
You know Count d'AIgout. I must call my lawyer at once.
- I'm sorry, Your Highness.
I have to leave. - I'll get in touch with you.
- Hello. Balzac, 2769. - Au revoir, monsieur.
Au revoir.
This is the Grand Duchess Swana.
I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon. It's very important. Get him right away.
Hello, Monsieur Cornillon?
The most incredible thing has happened. My jewels are here in Paris.
Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them.
Yes!
Now, we must act immediately.
Call the police, have them arrested.
Well, then get an injunction.
But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!
But they are my jewels.
There must be some way of getting them back.
What does he say?
But how can there be a question?
Are you my lawyer or theirs?
It's all right.
Yes, all right, I will call you later.
- What did he say?
- They're pretty hopeless.
There may be a chance, that's all.
The French government has recognized Soviet Russia... and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake.
He might be able to make up some kind of a case, but it would cost money.
Money, that's all they are interested in, those lawyers.
Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer?
Haven't you your little Volga boatman?
Very good, excellent, superb.
It'd be foolish to belittle the quality of the merchandise... but your terms are impossible.
My counteroffer is the absolute maximum.
But Monsieur Mercier...
Gentlemen, I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
We are undertaking this deal only because of the prestige involved.
And, frankly, we're expected to take a loss.
Capitalistic methods.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
This is Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski.
Who?
Count d'AIgout?
No, that must be a mistake.
No, we can't be disturbed.
I assure you no one else can meet the figure named by my syndicate.
At least not under these economic conditions.
We can wait.
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
Yes.
Gentlemen, let's put our cards on the table.
Right now, there's a Russian commission in New York... trying to sell 15 Rembrandts.
Another in London mortgaging the oil fields in Baku.
You need money, and quickly.
My offer is a very fair one, and doesn't even take advantage of your situation.
Just a minute.
- Now, listen. - We have just a minute.
- The pieces are all registered. - I know. Thank you so much.
- He's cutting our throat. - What can we do? We have to accept.
Comrades, don't let's give in so quickly.
After all, we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
All right, let's uphold it for another 10 minutes.
- We don't want to be disturbed. - My name is d'AIgout.
I telephoned.
If you want to see us, you must come in later.
- Just a word with Mercier. - You can't come in.
Monsieur Mercier, may I introduce myself?
I'm Leon d'AIgout.
I had the pleasure of meeting you in your beautiful shop.
I was admiring the platinum watch with the diamond numbers.
- Yes, of course. - You remember, I...
Glorious, aren't they?
- You have no right. - I did not permit you to come in here.
Just a moment.
I hope you haven't closed this deal.
- It may bring you serious trouble.
- Who are you and what do you want?
Those jewels belong to Grand Duchess Swana... and were seized illegally by the Soviet government.
I am acting for Her Highness.
Here is my power of attorney.
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all nonsense.
These may have been the jewels of the Grand Duchess Swana... but like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
We'll leave the problem of ownership to the French courts.
Meanwhile, I have filed a petition for an injunction... to prohibit you from either selling or removing the jewels.
Here is a copy.
If there is anything which isn't clear, I shall be glad to explain it.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, this introduces a new element into our negotiations.
- Until this claim is completely settled... - We can call our ambassador.
I give you my word, they were confiscated legally.
That's right.
Hold on, gentlemen, please try to understand my position.
I am not withdrawing.
My offer stands.
When you can produce a clear title approved by the French courts... we can close the deal.
Until then, gentlemen, good day.
I thought it my duty to warn you. I should have hated...
- to see you in trouble. - Thank you.
- I hope you will forgive me. - I consider myself very lucky.
- Good day. - Good day, monsieur.
You believe me, I...
Gentlemen, how about a little lunch?
- Will you get out of here!
- Yes, get out.
But don't look so gloomy. You may have a chance.
- We may have a chance? - That's ridiculous.
Yes, a very slim one.
I want to be fair.
I don't deny that you might have a case.
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer.
You talk to a lawyer and I'll talk to a judge.
That won't help you. You can't intimidate us.
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
Yes.
You think because you represent the former Grand Duchess...
- The Grand Duchess. - The former Grand Duchess.
At any rate, gentlemen, a charming, exquisite woman.
I warn you, if this case comes to trial, it will be before a French court.
And when the Grand Duchess takes the stand...
Go ahead, get her on the witness stand. What can she say?
But how will she look?
The fashions this spring are very becoming to her.
Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French... everybody in the courtroom will be French.
Have you seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the stand... and raises her skirt a little?
You sit down and pull up your pants and where would it get you?
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
No, I'm not a highwayman, just a nuisance.
All I want to do is make things as difficult as possible.
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us what is in your mind?
Yeah.
- What about my proposition? - What proposition?
I just said, let's have some lunch.
Hey, Sasha, Sergei, Misha.
What?
What do you want?
What can we do for you?
That telegram from Moscow, why should you bother about it?
- I've written it for you. - Leon, Leonitchka.
Why are you so good to us?
That's very nice, boys. Now, wait a minute.
What was the name of that Commissar of the Board of Trade?
Razinin.
Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.
- You wouldn't like Razinin. - No, he's a bad man.
- He sends people to Siberia. - We don't like Razinin.
- No. - We don't like him.
We like Leon.
Don't we like Leon?
Yes!
Wait a minute.
Now wait a minute, how's this?
"Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.
Unexpected situation here.
"Grand Duchess Swana in Paris, claims jewels...
"and has already brought injunction against sale or removal.
"After long and serious study...
"we suggest in the interest of our beloved country...
"a 50-50 settlement as best solution.
"Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski."
If we say that, we'll all be sent to Siberia.
- And if we have to go to Siberia... - I will send you a muff.
Leon, why are you so good to us?
Comrade waiter!
Why are you so good to us?
Get the champagne to the other room.
That's enough.
Go along.
- Take this to the telegraph office at once. - Yes, monsieur.
Hello.
Yes, Leon. What is it, Leon?
You can't hurry such things.
You must give Moscow a little time.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Why don't you drop in later?
Yes.
Au revoir.
What's the matter?
This is a telegram from Moscow. It must have been here all day.
"Halt negotiations immediately.
"Envoy Extraordinary arrives Thursday 5:20 p.m. With full power.
"Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin."
- It is Thursday. - It's 5:00 already.
I always said it would be Siberia.
Give me the desk, please.
This is this is the Royal Suite, Iranoff speaking.
Listen, a special envoy is coming from Moscow today.
He'll occupy the Royal Suite.
Move our things to the smallest room you've got.
Yes. Right away, instantly.
Pass, please.
Now this is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
How can we find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
That must be the one.
Yes, he looks like a comrade.
Heil Hitler.
- No, that's not him. - Positively not.
- What are we going to do now? - I don't know.
We must have missed him.
I'm looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary... acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin.
Present me to your colleagues.
- Comrade Buljanoff. - Comrade.
- Comrade Kopalski. - Comrade.
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
If we had known, we would have greeted you with flowers.
Don't make an issue of my womanhood.
We are here for work, all of us. Let's not waste any time. Shall we go?
Porter, here, please.
What do you want?
- May I have your bags, madame? - Why?
- He is a porter, he wants to carry them. - Why?
Why should you carry other people's bags?
That's my business, madame.
That's no business. That's social injustice.
That depends on the tip.
- Allow me, comrade. - No, thank you.
Ticket, please.
- How are things in Moscow? - Very good.
The last mass trials were a great success.
There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
What's that?
It's a hat, comrade.
A woman's hat.
How can such a civilization survive... which permits their women to put things like that on their heads?
It won't be long now, comrades.
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova.
I hope you like it.
Which part of the room is mine?
You see, comrade, it's a little different here.
They don't rent rooms in pieces. We had to take the whole suite.
- How much does this cost?
- 2,000 francs.
- A week?
- A day.
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
- A cow?
- 2,000 francs.
If I stay here a week, I will cost the Russian people seven cows.
Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
We had to take it on account of the safe.
For ourselves, we are much happier now... since we moved to a little room right next to the servants' quarters.
I'm ashamed to put a picture of Lenin in a room like this.
- Do you want to be alone, comrade?
- No.
Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
We did our best, comrade.
I hope so, for your sake. Let's examine the case.
- What does the lawyer say?
- Which lawyer?
You didn't get legal advice?
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess.
I am sure if you call him, he will give you a very clear picture.
I will not repeat your mistake.
I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
- Comrade Buljanoff?
- Yes, comrade?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two "F's"?
With two "F's," if you please.
Have you some cigarettes?
This is the Royal Suite. Please send up some cigarettes.
Yes.
You just telephone and you get what you want.
That's the capitalistic system.
Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment.
But at best, you've been careless in your duty to the State.
You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry.
Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time?
Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it.
Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors... there will not be enough bread for our people.
- And you, comrades... - We did it with the best intentions.
We can't feed the Russian people on your intentions.
Fifty percent to a so-called Grand Duchess.
Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy.
- Comrade Kopalski. - Yes, comrade.
Go at once to our embassy and get me the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
Yes, comrade.
Comrade Iranoff, go to the public library... and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
- Is there anything I can do, comrade?
- Yes.
You might get me an accurate map of Paris.
I want to use my spare time to inspect public utilities... and to make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Yes, comrade.
Come in.
- Hello. Cigarettes?
- Hello.
Comrades, you must have been smoking a lot.
Desk.
Yes, Monsieur Kopalski.
You are expecting Count d'AIgout?
But he is not to go to the Royal Suite under any circumstances.
He should go to your new room, 985.
Thank you, monsieur.
You, please.
Me?
Could you give me some information?
Gladly.
How long must we wait here?
Well, until the policeman blows his whistle again.
- At what intervals does he whistle?
- What?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
That's very funny.
I never thought of that before.
You've never been caught in a similar situation?
Yes, I have.
Now that I come to think about it, it's staggering.
Good heavens, if I add it up, I must have spent years waiting for signals.
Imagine, an important part of my life wasted between whistles.
- In other words, you don't know?
- No.
- Thank you. - You're welcome.
Can I be of any assistance to you?
- You might hold this for me. - I'd love to.
Correct me if I am wrong.
- We are facing north, aren't we?
- Facing north?
I would hate to commit myself without my compass.
- Pardon me, are you an explorer?
- No, I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
Good heavens, is that thing lost again?
Are you interested in a view?
I'm interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
Technical?
No, I'm afraid I couldn't be of much help from that angle.
A Parisian only goes to the Tower in moments of despair to jump off.
How long does it take a man to land?
Now isn't that too bad? The last time I jumped, I forgot to time it.
Let me see now, the Eiffel Tower...
Your finger, please.
Why do you need my finger?
It's bad manners to point with your own.
There, the Eiffel Tower.
And where are we?
Where are we?
Now, let me see.
Here we are.
There you are and here am I.
Feel it?
I'm interested only in the shortest distance between these two points.
- Must you flirt?
- Well, I don't have to but I find it natural.
- Suppress it. - I'll try.
For my own information... would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
It is that approach which has made Paris what it is.
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Nothing's happened recently to shake my self-confidence.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society.
It is having a superior earning power that makes you that way.
A Russian.
I love Russians.
Comrade, I've been fascinated by your Five-Year Plan for the last 15 years.
Your type will soon be extinct.
Taxi!
Can you tell me the exact width of the foundation... on which these piers are resting, and the depth?
You don't have to worry.
The thing is safe.
- I am not afraid... - "The foundation is 141 yards square."
- I hope you'll forgive me but I thought... - Go on.
"Four massive pieces of masonry are sunk to a depth of 46 feet...
"on the side of the Seine, and 29.5 feet on the other side.
"The girders of interlaced ironwork, which stay the structure...
"have an inclination of 54 degrees."
- That's a strange angle. - Yes, that's very strange.
"Ascending to the first platform is a staircase consisting of...
"829 steps."
"And an additional 254 steps to the very top.
"There's an elevator included in the price of admission."
It'll take you hours to walk up there.
The elevator will get you up in three minutes.
You gave me some very valuable information.
Thank you.
Thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before.
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Now don't misunderstand me.
I do not hold your frivolity against you.
As basic material, you may not be bad.
But you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture.
I feel very sorry for you.
But you must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles.
Look at it. It glitters.
I do not deny its beauty, but it's a waste of electricity.
What a city.
There are the grand boulevards blasted out of the heart of the old city.
The Arc de Triomphe, built to greet Napoleon's army.
The Opera.
Montparnasse. Montmartre.
And now, I'll show you the greatest attraction of all.
It'll cost me a franc, but it's worth it.
The most unique spot in all Paris. Really, I'm not exaggerating.
It's wonderful. It's charming.
It's...
Please.
What do you see?
I see a house. Looks like any other house.
- What's remarkable about it? - It's not the structure.
It's the spirit that dwells within it.
It has three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
- So it's your house? - Let's say I live in it.
It's such a pleasant little place. It has all the comforts.
Easy to reach, near the subway, bus, and streetcar...
- Does it mean you want me to go there? - Please, don't misunderstand me.
- Then you don't want me to go there?
- No.
I didn't say that either. Nothing would please me more.
Then why don't we go?
You might be an interesting subject of study.
I'll do my best.
- Good evening, Gaston. - Good evening, monsieur.
- Is this what you call the "butler"?
- Yes.
Good evening, comrade.
This man is very old. You shouldn't make him work.
He takes good care of that.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
No, but the mere thought makes my mouth water.
The day will come when you will be free.
Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.
Please.
Count d'AIgout, there have been several telephone calls.
Go to bed, little father.
- Now, may I offer you a drink? - Thank you, I'm not thirsty.
Perhaps something to eat.
I've had all the calories necessary for today.
Yes, all the calories.
What do we do now?
- Shall we have some music? - Is that customary?
It helps.
It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with his harp.
Not being so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I'll turn on the radio.
If there's anything you'd like to study, please go ahead.
I've nothing to conceal.
This is my desk, these are my books, and here am I.
Where shall we begin?
- I will start with you. - Excellent.
Let's see, I'm 35 years old, just over 6 feet tall... and weigh 182 pounds, stripped.
What is your profession?
My profession?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert... and keeping the landlord appeased, that's a full-time job.
And what do you do for mankind?
For mankind?
Yes, not so much for mankind.
But for womankind, my record isn't quite so bleak.
You are something we do not have in Russia.
Thank you.
Glad you told me.
That's why I believe in the future of my country.
I'm beginning to believe in it myself since I've met you.
I still don't quite know what it's all about.
It confuses me, frightens me.
But it fascinates me.
Ninotchka... do you like me just a little bit?
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Thank you.
The whites of your eyes are clear.
Your cornea is excellent.
Your cornea is terrific.
Ninotchka, tell me. You're so expert on things.
Can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
Why must you bring in wrong values?
Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological... or shall we say "chemical," process.
A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
I see.
What do you use instead?
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You don't have to do a thing.
Chemically, we are already quite sympathetic.
You are the most incredible creature I've ever met.
Ninotchka.
You repeat yourself.
Yes, I'd like to say it 1,000 times.
You must forgive me if I seem a little old-fashioned.
After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
It's never too late to change.
I used to belong to the petite bourgeoisie myself.
No.
My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm.
But I preferred the bayonet.
The bayonet?
Did you really?
- I was wounded before Warsaw. - Wounded, how?
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade.
Would you like to see my wound?
I'd love to.
A Polish lancer.
I was 16.
Poor Ninotchka.
Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all, I'm still alive.
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
Just what you see.
A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
You're the most adorable cog I've ever seen.
Ninotchka, let me confess something.
Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.
Do you hear that?
- It's 12:00. - It's midnight.
Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss.
Isn't that wonderful?
That's the way a clock works. What's wonderful about it?
Ninotchka, it's midnight.
One half of Paris is making love to the other half.
You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood... to add to your exhilaration.
I can't possibly think of any better reason.
That's false sentimentality.
You analyze everything out of existence.
You'd analyze me out of existence, but I won't let you.
Love isn't so simple, Ninotchka.
Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo?
Why do snails, the coldest of all creatures... circle interminably around each other?
Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates?
Why do flowers slowly open their petals?
Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion?
A general warmth in the palms of your hands.
A strange heaviness in your limbs.
A burning of the lips that isn't thirst... but something 1,000 times more tantalizing, more exalting than thirst.
You are very talkative.
Was that talkative?
No. That was restful.
Again.
Thank you.
My barbaric Ninotchka... my impossible, unromantic, statistical...
Again.
- The telephone is ringing. - Let it ring.
One of your friends may be in need of you.
You must answer.
Hello.
Yes.
What?
Yes. Well, I'm sorry. I couldn't make it.
No, I ran into an old friend from the army.
What?
The whole deal is off? Are you crazy, Buljanoff?
A special envoy arrived.
I'll be glad to see her whenever she wants to.
She doesn't want to see me?
What do you know about that?
I'll get in touch with her myself. What's her name?
Good heavens, these Russian names.
How do you spell it?
Y-A...
"Yakushova."
Thanks.
Yakushova Ninotchka.
Yes, all right, thank you.
I must go.
Or should I say "Special Envoy Yakushova"?
- Let's forget we ever met. - No, I have a much better suggestion.
Let's forget the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova.
You are Ninotchka, my Ninotchka.
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
All right, fight me as much as you want, only fight me tomorrow morning.
There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with an enemy.
You represent White Russia and I represent Red Russia.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
It is out of the question.
- Lf you wish to approach me... - You know I want to.
Then do it through my lawyer.
But Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this.
I am crazy about you.
I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
I must go.
I held you in my arms.
You kissed me.
I kissed a Polish lancer, too... before he died.
Yes, Marianne darling.
No, you didn't waken me. I'm not only up, I'm on my way out.
Yes, I want to catch Leon before he rushes out... and loses himself in my business affairs.
Everything was going perfectly until three days ago... when some horrid female envoy arrived from Moscow.
Now, we don't know where we are.
I'll telephone you tonight, darling.
Goodbye, dear.
I seem to remember some additional injunctive provision... dealing with the property of foreigners residing in France.
You are referring to Paragraph 59B, Section 25F of the Civil Code.
Page 824.
And do not fail to read the three footnotes.
While you are studying it, I will eat.
- Where to, madame? - Can you recommend a restaurant?
There's Grenier if you care for seafood.
- Where do you eat? - At Pere Mathieu.
- Where is that?
- It's just a place for workmen.
- Where is it?
- Down eight blocks, rue de Provelles.
Thank you.
Are you alone, madame?
A nice little corner table?
Or perhaps by the window would be better?
This way, madame.
I think this is the first time you've been in my little place.
Your face is new to me.
Now what shall it be?
Raw beets and carrots.
Madame, this is a restaurant, not a meadow.
Now, here's what we are offering today.
Please make your choice.
I'm sure you will find something to tempt your appetite.
Well, for goodness' sake, hello.
It certainly is a small world, isn't it?
Well, madame, shall we start with soup?
Fish soup today.
I got up at 5:00 to fish them from the Seine.
- Crawfish soup for me. - Very well, monsieur.
Then may I suggest an omelet with mushrooms?
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
Madame, if you don't think about food, what do you think about?
The future of the common people.
That's also a question of food.
I will bring you a nice little lunch, a la Pere Mathieu.
May I say something?
You insulted him, do you know that? You hurt his feelings.
It's just like telling a musician that you don't like music.
That good old man believes in food just as you believe in Karl Marx.
You can't go around hurting people like that, Comrade Yakushova.
But you can make it up to him. Do you know how?
By eating everything that he brings you with relish... by drinking everything with gusto... by having a good time for the first time in your natural life.
- I don't like you following me. - I didn't follow you.
- How did you get here? - I always eat here.
This is a place for working men.
But my dear child, I am most at home among working men.
I hate those places where you circulate, the Clarence Hotel and those places.
This is my natural element.
After all, what are any of us?
Working men.
At least, those of us who are worth our salt.
- Hiya!
- Hi.
Hiya, boys. How's everything today?
- Is the lunch all right?
- Fine.
- Pay our check. - Thank you, I will.
Great bunch of fellows.
My friend, I am happy to see you again.
I'm always glad to meet a new customer.
And I hope this first visit will not be your last one.
He's just an old man. His memory is weak.
What are you after?
Must one always be after something?
Your tactics are useless.
I'm not Buljanoff, Iranoff, or Kopalski.
Ninotchka, why must we talk business?
If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better.
You do me an injustice.
Ninotchka, when we first went to my apartment... did I have the slightest idea that you were connected with this deal?
You know now.
I know now that you're a man who employs business methods... which in Russia would be punished by death.
Death, always so glum.
What about life, Ninotchka? Do Russians never think about life?
Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we ever really have.
Don't take things so seriously. Nothing's worth it, really.
Please, relax.
I beg you, Sergeant.
- Smile. - What?
- Will you smile?
- Why?
- Well, just smile. - At what?
At anything.
At the whole ridiculous spectacle of life, at people being so serious... taking themselves pompously, exaggerating their own importance.
If you can't think of anything to laugh at, you can laugh at us.
- Why?
- Because we're an odd couple.
Then you should go back to your table.
No, I can't leave you. I won't, not yet.
Not until I've made you laugh at least once.
Now go back to your table.
That's not a laugh.
I mean a laugh from the heart.
I know.
I'm going to tell you a funny story.
Wait a minute, let me think of one.
I've got it.
It seems that there were two Frenchmen who went to America...
On which boat?
Let's drop it.
I don't think you'd care very much for that one anyway.
Probably not.
Here's a great one.
Maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it.
- Do you like Scotch stories? - Never heard one.
Well, here.
Two Scotchmen met on the street.
And I don't know the name of the street.
It doesn't matter anyway.
One's name was McGillicuddy and the other one's name was Mclntosh.
McGillicuddy said to Mclntosh, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy."
And McGillicuddy... Mclntosh said to McGillicuddy:
"Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy."
Then McGillicuddy said to Mclntosh, "How is Mrs. Mclntosh?"
And Mclntosh said to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?"
I wish they'd never met.
So do I.
How is this one?
Two men are looking at the moon.
One of them says to the other:
"Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?"
The other one says, "Sure it's true, about 500 million."
Then the first one says:
"They must be pretty crowded when it's half-moon."
- So you don't think that's funny?
- No.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it.
Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you.
I don't think so.
I'll give you one more chance.
Here goes.
When I first heard this joke, I laughed myself sick.
Here goes.
A man comes into a restaurant.
He sits down at the table and he says, "Waiter...
"bring me a cup of coffee without cream."
Five minutes later the waiter comes back and says...
"I'm sorry, sir. We have no cream. Can it be without milk?"
It's good, isn't it?
- Not funny?
- No.
Well, it is funny!
Everybody else thought it was funny!
Maybe you didn't get the point.
I'll tell it to you again.
A man comes into a restaurant.
- Did you get that?
- Yes.
All right.
He sits down at the table and he says to the waiter... Did you get that?
- Yes. - It isn't funny so far, but wait a minute.
He says to the waiter, "Waiter, bring me a cup of coffee."
Five minutes later, the waiter comes and says:
"I'm sorry, sir, we're all out of coffee."
No, you've got me all mixed up now.
Sits down at the table, says, "Bring me a cup of coffee." That's it.
He says, "Bring me a cup of coffee without cream."
Five minutes later, the waiter comes back and says:
"I'm sorry, sir. We have no cream. Can it be a glass of milk?"
You have no sense of humor!
None whatsoever.
Not a grain of humor in you. There's not a laugh in you.
Everybody else laughs at it, but not you.
What's so funny about this?
In addition to the arguments above enumerated for lifting this injunction... we wish to cite the decision of the High Court of Paris rendered in the case... of Princess Marishka against the Government of Montenegro... on the fifth day of August, 1897.
Comparing the facts in that case with our present set of facts... we feel that the treaty between the Republic of France and the USSR...
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
The other day I heard such a funny story, it still makes me laugh.
It's very funny.
Yes, about this injunction.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
That's two weeks from Thursday.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
I know, gentlemen.
It's in the hands of the court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Yes, it is unfortunate.
There's nothing we can do. Why get excited?
We'll leave these papers with you for your further consideration.
- Au revoir, madame. - Au revoir.
Well, that means another two weeks in Paris.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
I acted on your suggestion... and got in touch with the power and light authorities.
Whenever you want to visit their plants, they are open to you.
Yes, power and light. Thank you.
There is something else which I know will appeal to you.
A visit to the Paris sewers.
They tell me it's extremely instructive.
Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff?
You all look so wintry, comrades.
And why do we always keep the windows closed?
Isn't that amazing?
At home, there is still snow and ice, and here, look at the birds.
I always felt a little hurt when our swallows deserted us... in the winter for capitalistic countries.
Now I know why.
We have the high ideal... but they have the climate.
Comrades, I don't think I need you anymore.
- Is there anything we can do for you? - Not a thing.
Would you like to go out?
- Yes, sure.
- Have you any money?
- Here are 50 francs. - Thank you.
Bring me back 45.
Yes, of course.
- Yes, that's fine. - Goodbye, comrade.
- Have you the time, Gaston? - It's 8:42, sir.
I guess it must be 8:42.
- You seem to be a bit nervous, sir. - I am, Gaston.
If you'll forgive me, sir, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady...
I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
- Have you, Gaston?
- Decidedly.
Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market... and found you'd made your bed, sir.
Yes, I felt better for it all day long.
I felt as if I'd contributed something.
May I add, sir, it was with great amazement... that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table, sir.
That is a socialistic volume, which I refuse to so much as dust, sir.
I view with alarm the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
But I don't follow you, Gaston.
Isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position?
Your being my servant... wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
No, sir.
Good heavens, isn't there any revolt in you?
When I order you around, don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
No, sir.
You're a reactionary.
You can't tell me that you don't look forward to the day... when you can come in here, stand on your two feet... and say, "From now on, it's share and share alike."
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me.
Now, don't misunderstand me, sir.
I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months... but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me, sir.
Go to bed, little father, go to bed.
- I don't look too foolish? - Foolish?
If this dress were walking down the boulevard all by itself...
I'd follow it from one end of Paris to the other.
And when I caught up with it, I'd say:
"Wait a moment, you charming little dress.
"I want you to meet Ninotchka. You two were meant for each other."
Remember this room?
I've never been here before.
I wonder whom you're thinking of?
I know.
The girl with the map... always figuring out each step and worrying about north and south.
Today...
Now, this might shock you.
I walked up to a taxi, I said, "883 du Bois"... and here I am.
You see?
Life can be so simple.
- For 12 francs 75.
- 12.75? From the Clarence?
The son of a gun made a detour.
But he got you here.
It's 9:00.
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half:
"What are you plans for this evening, madame? '
First, I would like to take off my hat.
Then, could we have some music?
A wonderful idea.
- Radio or records? - Not radio.
Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
I'll play it very softly... because I have things to tell you about, which I can't shout.
Darling, I...
You see, I couldn't shout that.
Oh, Leon.
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago?
I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them.
You know, that's wrong.
They aren't funny.
They're silly, they're stupid.
And still I laugh at them.
And when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski...
I know they're scoundrels and I should hate them.
Then I realize who made them like that.
And instead of sending my report to Moscow...
I go down and buy a ridiculous hat.
And if this keeps on...
- Am I too talkative? - No, go on.
And Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I would never say... which I thought nobody ever should say, because I didn't think it exists.
And, Leon, I can't say it.
What a gesture for a sergeant.
- Leon, may I ask you something?
- Anything.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't.
- But if you do, you must tell the truth. - I promise.
Did you make any change in this room?
I don't think so.
When I was here before, I noticed a photograph of a woman... on the desk in a wide silver frame.
I thought, what a waste of silver. That's all I was interested in then.
Now, I would like to know. What happened to the woman?
The Grand Duchess?
She's very attractive.
She has great elegance.
She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
Ninotchka.
I love you.
I suppose she's very entertaining.
It must be lots of fun to be with a woman like that, so witty and...
Ninotchka.
You're jealous.
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself.
I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer.
- I couldn't breathe.
I couldn't stand it. - Oh, my darling.
Cafe de Lutece.
A table for tonight? Certainly, Count d'AIgout.
What time, may I ask?
After the opera, thank you very much.
Good evening, Your Highness.
Good evening.
You seem to be very crowded this evening.
- Can you manage a table near the floor? - Certainly, this way please.
- Count d'AIgout made the reservation. - Count d'AIgout?
Yes. It is only a small table, but we will put in some extra chairs.
No, that's another party.
Let's go to some other place. It's so crowded here.
No. This is glory. At last I'm going to have a look at that female Bolshevik.
Can we manage another table?
- Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
- Perfect.
You mean Leon's bringing the Bolshevik you told us about?
- Isn't it divine?
- I wouldn't have missed this for anything.
We must be very discreet.
If she sucks her soup... or drinks out of her finger bowl, don't laugh.
We mustn't embarrass poor little Leon.
He's gone through enough for my sake. We mustn't add insult to injury.
Is this satisfactory, Your Highness?
- Is it to be dinner, Your Excellency? - Later, perhaps.
- We'll just start with champagne. - Champagne.
I'm only afraid the doorman may spoil all our fun. If only he lets her in.
- Look, there's Leon. - Where?
Good evening, Count d'AIgout. If you please.
General, shall we dance?
- Is it dry?
- Yes, monsieur.
- Is that right, or do you prefer it sweet?
- I wouldn't know.
The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel.
The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne.
A battleship or an evening.
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk.
I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
From goats to grapes.
That's drinking in the right direction.
It's good.
From what I've read, I thought champagne was a strong drink.
It's delicate.
Does anyone ever get drunk on this?
Well, there have been cases.
But the headache... the next morning is worthwhile if you drink it with the right toast.
To us, Ninotchka.
Thank you, General.
Hello, Leon!
How are you, my dear?
- Hello, Swana.
Good evening, General. - How do you do?
You're looking magnificent tonight. Isn't he, General?
- Thank you.
- Is this your new dress suit?
I told you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you.
- Yes, you did. - It's a dream of beauty.
Never takes my word for anything.
- But I was right, wasn't I?
- Yes.
- Am I interrupting? - No, not at all.
Your Highness, may I present Comrade Yakushova?
How do you do?
- General Savitzky. - How do you do?
I've some wonderful news about Punchy. Do you mind if I sit down?
No, please.
Would you mind making my excuses at our table?
- Certainly. - Will you say I'll be back soon?
We can be proud of our Punchy. He had a triumph at the dog show.
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge.
I bought him the loveliest little sweater as a reward.
You should see him strutting in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.
Count d'AIgout gave me Punchy for my birthday.
You must've searched for weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy...
- didn't you, Leon?
- Months, Swana.
Poor Madame Yakushova. Here we are talking in mysteries.
- I'm sure you wonder what it's all about. - Not at all.
I understand perfectly.
Count d'AIgout gave you a dog.
You made it very clear, madame.
Oh, dear me.
I must be losing my finesse.
If I'm not careful, I'll be understood by everybody.
- Charming crowd here tonight, isn't it?
- I'm going, Leon.
But before I go, I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova.
Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
No, last year, madame.
Isn't it amazing? One gets the wrong impression of the new Russia.
It must be charming.
I'm delighted conditions have improved so.
I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
It would have been very embarrassing for people of my sort... to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia.
The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming.
And you know how vain women are.
Yes, you're quite right about the Cossacks.
We made a great mistake when we let them use their whips.
They had such reliable guns.
Will you do me a favor? Let's not talk about the good old days.
Yes, it's a very wise suggestion.
I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.
The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit... and that will be settled next week.
I understand everything will be over by Thursday.
Am I right?
Yes. You're right, madame.
It'll all be over by Thursday.
It's too bad you have so few more days here in Paris.
Leon, be sure and redouble your efforts... so madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.
- Good night, Leon. - Good night, Swana.
Now I think I need a glass of champagne.
Quickly, please tell me one of your funny stories.
A funny story?
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Please.
Well, there were two Scotchmen.
One's name was Mclntosh and the other one was McGillicuddy.
They met on the street.
No, I'll tell you another story.
A much better one.
The only thing that'll be over on Thursday will be the lawsuit.
There will be no Thursday for us.
Next week or any other week.
I won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar.
Isn't that a good story?
Wonderful, if one could believe it.
You must, darling.
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
Let's dance.
Leon, something is the matter.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too quickly.
Everything is so wonderful.
It's getting farther and farther away.
- What, darling?
- Thursday.
Yes, don't worry, everything's going to be all right.
Comrades!
Darling, please.
I want to talk to my brothers.
Don't shush me, please. I am the people.
I want to hold a speech.
- I want to overthrow the Grand Duchess. - You can't do that.
Oh, comrades!
The good people of France!
- Now, Ninotchka. - But they're all grand duchesses here.
I ordered out thousands of grand duchesses and I want to tell them.
Yes, dear, you're quite right. But first, you're going through that door.
You're going to lie down and take some spirits of ammonia.
- No speech?
- No speech.
I love you, my little Leonitchka.
And I adore you, Ninotchka. Go ahead, now.
- No speech?
- No. For heaven's sake, no speech.
- Give me a double brandy. - Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, Count, it is most embarrassing, but the lady you brought with you... is spreading communistic propaganda in the powder room.
What?
Give me another double brandy.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants... of the powder room to go on strike?
If she succeeds, the consequences will be disastrous.
What can I do about it?
She has been asked to leave the powder room, but without success.
We would appreciate it very much if you would see to it yourself.
- You want me to go in there? - I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
- Make it a triple brandy. - Yes, sir.
All right, tell the Grand Duchess. Tell everybody.
They know it anyway. It doesn't make any difference.
Get out.
- Don't tell them where we're going. - No, darling, nobody will find us.
- Are we going to build our little house? - Yes, a little white house.
- No, not white. - All right, we'll make it red.
No, let's not have any color. No color.
Just a "house" house.
- Let's form our own party. - Right.
Lovers of the world, unite.
- And we won't stretch up our arms. - No!
- And we won't clench our fists. - No.
- Our salute will be a kiss. - Yes.
A kiss.
Salute.
I am so happy.
No one can be so happy without being punished.
I will be punished, and I should be punished.
- Leon, I want to confess. - I know. It's the Russian soul.
Well, everyone wants to confess.
And if they don't confess, they make them confess.
I am a traitor.
When I kissed you, I betrayed a Russian ideal.
I should be stood up against the wall.
- Would that make you any happier? - Much happier.
All right.
I've paid the penalty.
Now, let's have some music.
- Yes, let's turn on the radio. - Radio?
What's radio?
Radio's a little box that you buy on the installment plan... and before you tune it in, they tell you there's a new model out.
Yes, I know where that is. There's one around here somewhere.
It has a little knob that you turn.
- A little knob, that's right. - Yeah. Maybe it's in here.
- Just a little knob. - It's a radio and has a knob.
Now, maybe it's in here. Let's see. There it is.
- There's the knob. - There's the knob.
Now, what shall we get, the news?
No news.
We don't want to know what's happening in the world.
We want to be left alone, don't we?
Yes, darling, all by ourselves.
Then turn to the left and stop at seven.
Turn to the left and stop at seven.
- No music. - No music.
There it is, Thursday.
You can't rip it out of the week.
There they are.
- They're terrible things, those jewels. - But big.
They are the tears of Old Russia.
- See that stone? - Who cried that one?
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great.
For it he sold 10,000 serfs in the market.
But, darling, don't get impatient. Wait till we're married.
You know that worthless butler of mine, that reactionary?
Some day I'll come home to you and I'll say:
"Darling, I drove Gaston to the market this morning...
"and look what I got for him."
Darling, come here.
Let me put this on you.
- No. - Yes, you will teach these jewels.
For the first time, they will learn how they can really look.
They belong to the people.
And I give them back to the people.
I make you Ninotchka the Great...
Duchess of the People...
Grand Duchess of the People.
- Is this the wish of the masses? - It is their wish.
Thank you, Leon. Thank you, masses.
- Can I make a speech now? - Please.
Comrades, people of the world.
The revolution is on the march. I know.
Bombs will fall, civilization will crumble... but not yet, please.
Wait. What's the hurry?
Give us our moment. Let's be happy.
- We're happy, aren't we, Leon? - Yes, darling.
So happy and so tired.
Smile, little father. Smile.
Come in.
- Good morning. - What?
It's tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you'll forgive me.
I know it's extremely cruel to awaken anyone at such an hour.
Don't you recognize me? I'm the Grand Duchess Swana.
I know exactly how you feel, my dear.
The morning after always does look grim... if you happen to be wearing last night's dress.
Don't be embarrassed by my presence, though.
You couldn't have found anyone more sympathetic to your condition.
I think we can cut your visit short.
- Leon is not here. - Of course not, my dear.
I didn't come here with any such suspicion.
How ridiculous.
Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
What is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean?
"I'm delighted to have you here."
I haven't reached that state of civilization, therefore I must ask you to leave.
Leave?
That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave.
I don't mean this hotel, and I don't mean Paris. I mean France.
There's a plane for Moscow at 5:40.
Do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
My palace in Petrograd.
Yes, you took that away from me.
You took away my czar, my country, my people.
Everything I had.
But nothing more.
People cannot be taken away, madame... neither 160 million nor one.
Not if you have their love. You hadn't.
That's why you're not in Russia any longer... and that's why you came here this morning.
Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be.
Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
Elysee 2763.
Believe me, Leon can't help you.
He doesn't know anything about the jewels.
I give you my word. I swear it.
Where are they?
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear.
They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
Where are they?
Don't worry, last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open.
He may have overstepped his function as a waiter... but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.
I just put this on for sentiment.
The rest are absolutely safe, I assure you.
- But if you feel like notifying the police... - You leave me no choice.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet envoy... to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
I'll have to face the consequences, but so will you.
Don't forget, they'll ask you how you got them.
That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother.
They were given to her by her mother.
In fact, they're mine. You can't steal what belongs to you.
They always belonged to the Russian people.
They paid for them with their blood, their lives, and you'll give them back.
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
Let's free ourselves from emotionalism... and try to solve the problem in a practical way.
Our situation has considerably changed.
Before I had only a claim to the jewels.
Now I have the jewels.
In other words, moral ideas have no weight with you.
All right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know...
- France has recognized the Soviet. - Unfortunately.
Under the Soviet law, the jewels belong to the State.
- France is going to uphold that ownership. - Yes, my lawyer agrees with you.
He says that France will uphold it in every court... but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that.
And when I say it will take two years...
I am, as always, conservative.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you?
I know money was no object... as long as you could squeeze it out of the pockets of the people.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread.
Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
I see.
You've calculated it in terms of hunger.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial.
Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years.
We can condense those two years to two minutes...
- if you want to accept my proposition. - Go on.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign any necessary papers... if you will take that 5:40 plane to Moscow.
That's not the way to win him back. Not Leon.
I think I know Leon quite as well as you. Perhaps a little better.
Leave that worry to me.
Now, 5:40 leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier... but naturally you'II... be too busy for any farewells.
I will see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner.
And I will also see you to the airport.
That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.
Yes?
Hello.
Yes, Leon.
No, you didn't waken me.
I'm fine, thank you.
Yes, it was wonderful.
For luncheon?
I'm afraid I can't.
I have lots of things to attend to today, Leon.
I'm going to be very busy.
To tell you the truth, I'm a little tired and I would like to rest.
Maybe you're right.
Perhaps it is the champagne.
For dinner?
Of course, 7:00 here.
7:00 will be all right.
Come in.
Yes.
Just a moment.
- You can leave it here. - Yes, madame.
Operator, will you switch the call, please?
Darling, your present just arrived.
It's very silly and very wonderful.
What?
I won't forget. 7:00.
Goodbye, darling.
What?
Salute.
- Good afternoon, Jacqueline. - Good afternoon, Your Highness.
- Madame, I... - Yes, I know.
You didn't find my other glove. It's all right.
You're forgiven.
Thank you, Your Highness.
Count d'AIgout is waiting. He's been here for some time.
Count d'AIgout?
Yes.
Leon, darling.
How nice.
- Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
- No, thanks, Swana.
Did I act stupidly last night?
Should I apologize?
No.
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
- Yes. - No, my little Volga boatman.
Have you forgotten our First Commandment?
Never complain, never explain.
It's worked so often and so perfectly in the past, let's not break the rule.
Please don't look so guilty.
Otherwise, I...
Swana, just this once, I must ask you to listen to me.
All right.
- I'm listening. - I know you hate the obvious.
But do you mind if, for the moment, I'm not the least subtle?
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
There are 100 ways of approaching it... but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase.
I'm in love, Swana.
I thought it was something serious. How could you frighten me so?
It must be serious.
Not so long ago I'd have considered such a statement juvenile... and rather middle-class.
Now I can say it without a stammer, without a blush.
I'm in love, Swana.
But, Leon, this has the ugly sound of regeneration.
- I'm afraid that's what it is, Swana. - Always late.
Same old trouble, Leon.
Whether you take me to the opera... or call for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time.
Now, when it's a question of your reform, late again by about five minutes.
- What is this, Swana?
- Knowing the efficiency... of the French air service, I think I can safely guarantee... that Madame Yakushova has taken off for Moscow.
- Has done what?
- She's gone, Leon.
- You don't expect me to believe that? - There's the telephone.
If you call the hotel, you'll find you have no 7:00 appointment.
Imagine.
For once in our lives we were in Paris...
- and we never went to the Eiffel Tower. - That's right.
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
Yes, it is an amazing piece of engineering... still the most remarkable iron structure in the world.
Leading to the top... there is a staircase of over 1,000 steps... but there is an elevator included in the price of admission.
Everything's in order, I hope you will enjoy your trip to Russia.
Thank you.
By the way, I've heard so many rumors... about laundry conditions in Russia.
Is it advisable to take one's own towels?
Certainly not.
That is only capitalistic propaganda.
- We change the towel every week. - Thank you.
Hello. Comrade Cazabine?
No, I am sorry.
He hasn't been with us for six months.
He was called back to Russia and was investigated.
You can get further details from his widow. You're very welcome.
Pardon me.
I was interested in what you were saying.
When an envoy goes back to Russia and they don't like what he's done... they put him out of the way?
Not always. Look at me.
I've been back twice.
Here's my passport. Please give me a visa.
- I must leave for Russia immediately. - Count Leon d'AIgout.
A count.
- A nobleman. - Don't hold that against me, please.
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
- Business. - What business?
- Private. - There is no private business in Russia.
This whole thing seems very suspicious.
What is the real reason?
If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice.
Confess.
Listen.
I'll be absolutely frank with you.
- I have no business in Moscow. - I think so, too.
I want to see a friend of mine, a very dear friend.
It's a personal matter that has no relation to social philosophies or politics.
- It's a girl. - It is love which drags you to Moscow.
- Yes. - No visa.
- But I must get into that country of yours. - No visa.
But that's impossible.
You can't do it!
You haven't the right to...
- Listen.
If you don't give me that visa... - You're going to force us?
You advertise all over the world for people to go into your country... and when somebody tries, you won't let them!
- Why should I take a chance? - On what?
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
- What for?
Why? - Or a tunnel, or a bridge?
Nothing but suspicions.
That's the trouble with you.
Listen, if you don't let me in, I'll stand in front of this office of yours... and warn people to keep away from Russia.
I'll picket your whole country. I'll boycott you, that's what I'll do.
No more vodka, no more caviar, no more Tchaikovsky, no more borscht!
- Wait a minute. I've got a better idea. - What?
You can tell the Kremlin that's just the beginning!
No visa.
March!
Comrades of the world... never has there been such a May Day parade as this.
- Good afternoon, Anna. - Good afternoon.
Aren't you late?
No.
The opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
- Didn't you march today? - They didn't let me. I'm in disgrace.
Last week, at the performance of Carmen, I played a sour note.
The conductor got so excited, he yelled:
"There is sabotage in the string section!"
Too bad, Anna.
You missed an inspiring day.
Yes, I know.
Are you expecting someone?
- A few friends.
Just a small dinner party. - And what are you serving?
- An omelet. - An omelet?
Aren't you living a little above your ration?
I saved two eggs... and each of my friends is bringing his own.
Just goes to prove the theory of our State.
If you stand alone, it means a boiled egg... but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together, you've got an omelet.
That reminds me.
Have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
Well, one man... I'll tell you later.
That Gurganov.
You never know whether he's on his way to the washroom, or the Secret Police.
- You should be more careful. - And you, too, Ninotchka.
- About what?
- Ever since you've been back from Paris...
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris.
I haven't said a word.
That's just it.
It makes people feel queer.
And I don't want you to get in any trouble.
- I have nothing to hide. - You should. I'll show you.
When I passed through the laundry yard today...
I saw all the women huddled around this, so I brought it up here.
Things like this create a bad feeling.
First they didn't know whose it was... and then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion.
Some said it's what we all ought to wear.
Others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline.
- It undermines our whole cause. - I see.
You know how it is today.
All you have to do is wear... a pair of silk stockings, and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
Thank you, Anna.
I'll dry it up here when I wash it next.
I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
Ninotchka, I'm your friend. You can trust me.
- Did you bring back anything else?
- No.
I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
Tell me, what else did you have?
Well, a hat.
What was it like?
Oh, it was very silly. I'd be ashamed to wear it here.
As beautiful as that.
What else?
Come, tell me.
- An evening gown. - An evening gown?
Yes, it's a dress you wear in the evening.
What do you wear in the morning?
When you get up you wear a negligee, then you change into a morning frock.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
- Yes. - Now, Ninotchka, you are exaggerating.
No, it's true.
That's how they live in the other world.
Here we dress to cover up our bodies.
To keep warm.
And there?
Sometimes they're not completely covered, but they don't freeze.
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this.
So soft.
- Something you don't even see. - You feel it, though.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
What is it, Anna?
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married... when he comes back from the maneuvers.
Would it be asking too much if...
- You want this? - Just for the honeymoon.
- It's yours for good. - Ninotchka.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'll never forget what you've done.
Am I going to play that cadenza tonight!
...individuals, yes. As atoms in the cosmos of Soviet Russia.
...and 30 million peasants, 85% of the population into an automobile and the muzhik into a tractor... and then let the capitalists try to keep...
No music.
Ninotchka.
Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski!
How are you, you three scoundrels?
Well, we are back home.
You know what they say, there is nothing like home.
Yes, and we might as well face it.
Now, you mustn't talk that way, you must adjust yourselves.
- Let's be brave. - Brave, that's right.
- Come and sit down. - Let's be happy that we are all alive.
That we owe to Ninotchka.
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us...
- who knows what would've happened? - I can tell you exactly.
Let's forget everything, except we're together.
- Yes, let's do that. - It's a real Paris reunion.
If you close your eyes and listen to our voices, we might be in Paris.
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here, too.
Look how nicely she has arranged the table.
Yes, how lovely. And what a wonderful room you have here.
- How many families live here with you? - Only myself and two other girls.
A cello player in the opera, and a streetcar conductor.
Just three people in a room this size?
Buljanoff, look here.
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Look at this.
- What good material. - Naturally, it's not the Royal Suite.
Comrades, once and for all, we are in Moscow.
Yes, there's no doubt of that. Just look out of the window and there it is.
And it's great.
Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
It's a tremendous achievement.
- You must be reasonable, comrades. - She is right.
Anyhow, let's talk ourselves into it.
All right.
It's great. It's marvelous. It's wonderful.
Just see how happy the people look from here.
Can you blame them?
At least the May Day parade is over.
That's another thing.
It's spring.
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
- Even the swallows are back. - Really?
Yes, that's right.
Maybe it's the same swallow we saw in Paris.
Yes, it is, Ninotchka. It is.
He must have been in Paris.
You can see it in his whole attitude.
He picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head and dropped it.
We must be patient. Finally we got the spring, didn't we?
Let's forget the future. Let's stop being sentimental.
- Let's start that omelet. - That's right.
- Here is my egg. - And here is mine.
And here are mine.
I don't know where's my egg? I had an egg, too.
Comrades, I am out of the omelet.
- Don't worry, there'll be enough. - Of course, comrade.
- Thank you. - Now come over here.
Come, Ninotchka, let's make it in real Parisian style.
- Yeah. - Let's fill it with confiture des prunes.
A man like that.
All he has to do is walk through a room and the omelet drops.
Yes.
Comrade Yakushova, here, the postman left this letter for you.
Thank you, Vladimir.
- What is it, Ninotchka? - Ninotchka, what is it?
- It's from Paris. - From Paris?
- A bill?
- From Leon.
- From Leon?
- How is he, tell us?
Bad news?
Well, I think it's getting late.
Good night, Ninotchka.
Thanks for a wonderful dinner.
- Good night, Ninotchka. - Good night.
Good night.
They can't censor our memories, can they?
No.
Come in.
- Good morning, comrade. - Good morning, Comrade Commissar.
Here's my report on materials available for trading in the next four months.
Does it include products of the far eastern provinces?
- Yes, it does. - You've finished the whole investigation?
That's marvelous.
You must have worked day and night.
- Don't you ever sleep?
- I need very little sleep.
We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange.
I have already started a survey on our most urgent needs.
Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
May I ask why?
- Please sit down. - Thank you.
Now, comrade, have you heard from Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
- No. - I haven't either... but I have heard about them.
You must realize... it was on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople.
Without that, I never would have trusted them... on a mission as important as a fur deal.
May I ask what has happened?
If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now... you wouldn't believe it.
They are sitting there, those three, for six weeks... and haven't sold a piece of fur.
This anonymous report was sent to me.
They are dragging the good name of our country through every cafe and nightclub.
Here. "How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems...
"if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski get so drunk...
"that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window...
"and complain to the management that it didn't fly."
Unbelievable!
It's an outrage.
They shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report's correct?
Naturally, I want to verify it, and that's why I need you.
- You want me to go to Constantinople? - Yes, leaving immediately.
I appreciate your confidence in me... but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission.
I should hate to interrupt my present work.
I am positive my survey is more important... than finding out whether three of our comrades have been... drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
I am sorry.
I don't want to overstep my position... but please don't send me.
Please, comrade, let me stay here.
Let me finish my work. I'm in the rhythm of it now.
I don't want to go away.
I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again.
It throws you out of gear.
Let me finish my work.
I have concentrated everything in it.
Please don't make me go.
Don't waste my time, comrade.
Do your duty. Goodbye.
I shall do my best.
How do you like it, Ninotchka? Isn't it wonderful?
- Tell us, Ninotchka. - Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
Now, please don't start figuring it out in cows.
You've done it again, and I'm responsible.
How can you forget yourselves this way?
You were sent here to make money not to spend it.
Buljanoff, she still has those old-fashioned ideas.
- It is high time she got out of Russia. - Comrades.
- I must be stern with you. - That's our old Ninotchka.
Don't forget the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
Ninotchka!
Razinin?
Good old Razinin. Is he still alive? How does he manage?
- Comrades... - Friends, Ninotchka, we are friends.
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any more.
No.
We can say whatever we want.
We can shout, we can complain.
Look.
The service in this hotel is terrible!
See?
Nobody comes, nobody pays any attention.
- That's freedom. - That's bad management.
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for one moment?
I must have a complete report of your negotiations...
- and a detailed expense account. - No, don't ask for it.
There is a Turkish proverb which says:
"If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
And there is an old Russian saying:
"The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
With our cream situation as it is... it's Russia that should apologize to the cats.
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time.
How will it end?
- Shall we tell her?
- Yes.
- Ninotchka, I hope you'll be our guest. - Guest?
- Yes, we have opened a restaurant. - A restaurant?
We have a wonderful electric sign:
"Dine with Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
You mean you're deserting Russia?
Ninotchka, don't call it desertion.
Our little restaurant, that is our Russia.
The Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef stroganoff.
- Of blinis and sour cream. - The Russia of pirozhki.
- People will eat and love it. - We are not only serving good food... we are serving our country.
We are making friends.
Who gave you this idea? Who's responsible for all this?
There is something in Constantinople, something irresistible.
It's in the air. It may come around the corner...
- when you walk down the street. - It may step out of a bazaar.
It may be waiting for you in a corridor. It may hide in the shadow of a minaret.
And right now it's on the balcony.
They wouldn't let me in, so I had to get you out.
So you're behind all this. I should have known.
Trying to keep me away from you.
As though that were possible.
Naturally, I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose... but I found a way, didn't I?
Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote.
And all my letters came back to me.
And the one I got, they wouldn't let me read.
It began, "Ninotchka, my darling"... and it ended "Yours, Leon."
I won't tell you what came between.
I'll show you, I'll prove it.
But it'll take a long time, Ninotchka.
At least a lifetime.
But, Leon, I'm only here for a few days.
All right, if you don't stay with me, then I'll have to continue my fight.
I'll travel wherever there are Russian commissions.
I'll turn them all into Iranoffs, Buljanoffs, and Kopalskis.
The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants.
I'll depopulate Russia.
Comrade, once you saved your country by going back.
This time you can only save it by staying here.
Well, if it is a choice between my personal interest... and the good of my country, how can I waver?
No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
Darling.
These hills here are full of Apaches.
They've burnt every ranch building in sight.
He had a brush with 'em last night. Says they're been stirred up by Geronimo.
Geronimo?
How do we know he isn't lying?
He's a Cheyenne. They hate Apaches worse than we do.
Clear the wires to Lordsburg.
That's Lordsburg now, sir. They seem to have something very urgent to tell you, sir. - Well?
Well, what's wrong?
- The line went dead, sir.
- What do you got there?
- Only the first word, sir.
"Geronimo."
- Well, so long, Buck!
- Nine trip, Buck? - So-so.
- Got the payroll for the mining company?
- Yes, sir. Right here in this box here.
- Good. Give me a lift here, Jim, will ya?
Jim, I'll pay ya that two bits when I come through. - Okay, partner.
- Hey, now, you kids get away from that wheel.
Well, sir, we run into a little snow up there.
'T weren't bad, though, but you fellas better prepare for a good frost.
Passenger out for Τonto.
You'd better get out and stretch your leg - l mean, your limbs, ma'am.
We're gonna change horses here.
- ls there a place here where l can have a cup of tea?
- Well, yes, ma'am. You can get a cup of coffee at the hotel across the street there.
- Thank you, driver.
- You look a little peaked - - I'll be all right, thank you. - Yes, ma'am.
Why, Lucy Mallory. Nancy.
- How are you, Captain Whitney?
- Fine, thanks, Mrs. Mallory.
Why, whatever are you doing in Arizona?
I'm joining Rinhard in Lordsburg.
He's there with his troops. He's a lot nearer than that, Mrs. Mallory.
He's been ordered to Dry Fork. That's the next stop for the stagecoach.
You'll be with your husband in a few hours.
I'm so glad to see you, Lucy.
We'll have a cup of coffee. You must be tired from that long trip.
- Who is that gentleman?
- Hardly a gentleman, Mrs. Mallory.
I should think not. He's a notorious gambler.
Hello, Mink! Hidee, Frank!
Well, Marshal, I'm looking for my shotgun guard. ls he here?
Out with the posse, Buck, trying to catch the Ringo Kid.
- Ringo? I thought Ringo was in the pen.
- He was. Busted out?
Well, good for him.
My guess, the Kid's aiming' to get even with them Plummer boys.
It was their testimony sent him to the penitentiary.
Well, all I gotta say is that he'd better stay away from that there Luke Plummer.
Why, gosh, Luke's run all of Ringo's friends out of Lordsburg.
The last trip there, I seen him hit a rancher on the head with the barrel of his gun... and, well, he just laid it wide open like a butchered steer.
- You seen Luke Plummer in Lordsburg? - Yes, sirree.
You boys take care of the offline for a couple days.
I'm going to Lordsburg with Buck.
Gonna ride shotgun. Gosh, if I could learn to keep my big mouth shut -
Here's the payroll, Mr. Gatewood.
Ever since I opened this bank, I've been trying to tell those people... to deposit their payroll six months in advance.
It's good, sound business. Good business for you, Mr. Gatewood.
Well, there's your receipt - $50,000.
And remember this – what's good for the bank is good for the country.
Now, now, now, my dear lady -
Good riddance to bad rubbish! Get out and stay out!
I'm keeping your trunk 'cause you ain't paid your rent.
"ls this the face...
"that wrecked a thousand ships... and burned the towerless tops of Ilium?"
Farewell, fair Helen.
Doc.
Doc, can they make me leave town when I don't want to go?
Do I have to go? Dallas, don't you go makin' no fuss.
Do I have to go, Doc, just because they say so?
Dallas, I've got my orders.
don't blame these ladies. lt ain't them.
It is them!
Doc, haven't I any right to live?
What have I done?
We're the victims of a foul disease called social prejudice, my child.
These dear ladies of the Law and Order League are scouring out the dregs of the town.
Come on.
Be a proud, glorified dreg like me.
- You get going, Doc. You're drunk.
- Two of a kind. - Just two of a kind.
- Take my arm, Madame la Comtesse.
The tumbril awaits! To the guillotine!
Wait till I get my badge, girls! I'll join you!
If ever you go East, brother... come out to our house for dinner.
No one in all Kansas City, Kansas, sets a better table than my dear wife, Violet.
- Jerry.
- Yeah, Doc.
Jerry, I'll admit, as one man to another... that, economically, I haven't been of much value to you.
But... suppose you could put one on credit?
If talk was money, Doc, you'd be the best customer I got.
I'm leaving town, Jerry.
- Honest? - Yes, old friend.
And I thought you might, out of memory of our many happy -
All right, Doc. Just this one. Thank you, Jerry.
Here's a man goin' on the stagecoach with you.
- He's an Easterner from Kansas City, Missouri.
- Kansas City, Kansas, brother.
To your health, Reverend.
I'm not a clergyman. My name is Peacock.
I'm a -
He's a whiskey drummer.
A what?
Well, well!
How are you, Mr. Haycock?
- Peacock. - don't tell me, sir. I know, I know.
A familiar name and an honored name. I never forget a face or a friend.
Samples?
Rye.
Well, Brownie! - Blackie! Belle!
Well, lookee here.
Got a pretty good team there.
Back it up. Got my favorite team there, Slim! Yeah, Buck, they're all good and fresh.
I want five dollars, Henry!
Certainly, my dear. Certainly.
What is it to be this time, my dear?
A pair of shoes - l want to pay the butcher.
Dinner's at 12:00. don't worry, my dear.
I'll be there. I've invited the ladies of the Law and Order League.
All - All aboard for Dry Fork...
Apache Wells, Lee's Ferry and Lordsburg!
- I'll take that, Dallas. - Thanks.
In you go, Dallas, and a pleasant voyage.
Leave your baggage, Doc? Thank you. Thank you, my friend.
Curley, my shingle. Carry it with honor.
- I'll take it, Doctor.
- No.
No trouble at all. No trouble at all. I'll carry it on my lap.
Here we go.
Here we go, Reverend.
Mrs. Whitney, you're not going to let your friend travel with that creature.
She's right, Lucy. And besides, you're not well enough to travel.
It's only a few hours, Nancy.
I'm quite all right. But you shouldn't travel a step without a doctor.
There is a doctor., dear. The driver told me.
Doctor?
Doc Boone?
Why, he couldn't doctor. a horse.
Lucy darling, you must be very careful. Take good care of yourself. - Watch that step now.
- Lady folks ride facing forward, please.
There you go.
- Pleasant journey, Mrs. Mallory.
- Thank you. Good-bye! - Good-bye!
Like an angel in a jungle.
A very wild jungle.
What are you doin', Hatfield - talkin' to yourself?
You wouldn't understand, cowboy.
You've never seen an angel... nor a gentlewoman... nor a great lady.
I raise, gentlemen.
Well, so long, Buck! So long, Curley! Nine trip, boys!
- So long, kids! - Wait a minute!
Hold it there, Buck!
Cavalry comin'! Steady, girls!
Captain Sickels asks if you'll deliver this dispatch in Lordsburg the moment you arrive. - The telegraph line has been cut.
- Sure. We're going with you as far as the noon station at Dry Fork.
There'll be a troop of cavalry there, and they'll take you on to Apache Wells.
From Apache Wells, you'll have another escort of soldiers into Lordsburg.
But you must warn your passengers that they travel at their own risk.
- At their own risk? What's the trouble, Lieutenant?
- Geronimo. - Geronimo?
Well, then I ain't go -
- Will you sit down!
Of course, the army has no authority over you gentlemen. - lf you think it's unsafe to make the trip -
- This stage is goin' to Lordsburg.
If you think it ain't safe to ride along with us... I figure we can get there without you soldier boys.
I have my orders, sir, and I always obey orders.
Did you all hear what the lieutenant said? Yes, we heard.
Well, me and Buck are taking this coach through, passengers or not. Whoever wants to get out can get out.
- lt's - - Courage.
Courage, Reverend.
- Ladies first. - Excuse me.
How about you, Dallas?
What are you tryin' to do, scare somebody?
They got me in here. Now let 'em try to put me out.
There are worse things than Apaches.
If you'll take my advise, ma'am, you won't take this trip.
My husband is with his troops in Dry Fork.
If he's in danger, I want to be with him.
You see, brother, I have a wife and five children in Kansas City.
Then you're a man. By all the powers that be, Reverend, you're a man.
- All right, folks. - Marshal!
Make room for one more.
I'm offering my protection to this lady. I can shoot fairly straight, if there's need for it.
That's been proved too many times, Hatfield. All right, get in. We're late.
- May I trouble you to move over, sir?
- Yes. Yes, of course.
Close the door.
- Aw, Curley, we shouldn't -
- Get going, Buck! Bessie!
Brownie! Bill! Farewell, ladies!
- Sweetheart! Come on now, girl! - Good-bye!
- Room for another passenger?
- Sure is, Mr. Gatewood.
- Goin' to Lordsburg? - That's right.
Just got a telegram.
Had to stop to pack this bag.
Oh, I'll got it in. Hyah, hyah!
Sassy! Blackie! Brownie!
Queenie, steady, girl. Good boy.
If there's anything I don't like, it's drivin' a stagecoach through Apache country.
Fancy catching Gatewood outside of town that way.
I just took this job 10 years ago so I could make enough money... to marry my Mexican girl, Julietta, and I been workin' hard at it ever since.
Bonnie, get over there! Ho!
- Marriage?
- Well, certainly.
My wife's got more relatives than anyone you ever did see.
I bet I'm feedin' half the state of Chihuahua.
Sweetheart! Ho!
That seem funny to you about Gatewood?
Yeah, and then what do I get to eat when I get home in Lordsburg?
Nothin' but frijole beans. That's all.
Nothin' but beans, beans, beans. Bessie!
Brownie! Blackie girl! Yow!
Excuse me, ladies.
Close quarters. Warm today.
Your wife made it warm for me, Gatewood.
She was chairman of our farewell committee.
Fine-looking bunch of soldier boys back there.
Always gives me great pride in my country... when I see such fine young men in the U.S. Army.
Anybody know where they're going?
Brother, aren't you aware of what's happened?
Happened?
I – I don't follow you, Reverend.
I'm not a clergyman. I'm a -
My friend's a whiskey drummer. We're all gonna be scalped, Gatewood.
Massacred in one fell swoop.
- That's why the soldiers are with us.
- He's joking, of course.
No, he's not. Dear, no. I wish he were.
It's that old Apache butcher, Geronimo.
Geronimo - nice name for a butcher.
He's jumped the reservation.
He's on the warpath. Geronimo?
Why weren't the passengers notified?
Why wasn't I told? - We -
- We were told, Gatewood. Yes.
Weren't you told when you got that message from Lordsburg?
Yes, yes. Y-Yes, of course. I - l forgot.
Steady now! String out! Sweetheart!
Now, doggone it, they're bringing up her grandfather... all the way from Mexico to live with us.
I can't figure out how he got that message.
- Who?
Her grandfather?
- No, Gatewood.
Sweetheart!
- Said he got a message. - Sweetheart!
- Telegraph line ain't workin'.
- Sweetheart.
Hold it! Whoa!
Steady! Ho. Ho.
- Hey, look, it's Ringo. - Yeah. Hello, Kid.
Hello, Curley.
Hiya, Buck! How's your folks?
Just fine, Ringo. - Except my grandfather came up -
- Shut up.
Didn't expect to see you ridin' shotgun on this run, Marshal.
- Goin' to Lordsburg?
- l figured you'd be there by this time.
No.
Lame horse.
Well, it looks like you've got another passenger. Yeah.
I'll take the Winchester.
You may need me and this Winchester, Curley. Saw a ranch house burning' last night.
You don't understand, Kid. You're under arrest.
Curley -
- Everything all right, Marshal?
- Everything's all right, Lieutenant.
- Hope I ain't crowding' you folks none. - The more, the merrier.
Bonnie! Brownie! Blackie!
Hyah, Bessie!
Ain't Ringo a fine boy? I think so.
You're just smarter than a trade rat. You knew all the time he was goin' to Lordsburg.
Hey, reckon what he meant he saw ranch houses burning'?
- Apaches. - Apaches.
So, you're the notorious Ringo Kid.
My friends just call me Ringo. Nickname i had as a kid.
Right name's Henry.
Seems to me I knew your family, Henry.
Didn't I fix your arm once when you were, - bucked off a horse?
- Are you Doc Boone? - l certainly am.
Now, let's see.
I'd just been honorably discharged from the Union army... after the War of the Rebellion.
You mean the War for the Southern Confederacy, sir.
I mean nothing of the kind, sir.
That was my kid brother broke his arm.
You did a good job, Doc, even if you was drunk.
Thank you, son.
- Professional compliments are always pleasing. - Yes, they are.
What happened to that boy whose arm I fixed?
He was murdered.
Put out that cigar.
You're annoying this lady. Excuse me, madam.
Being so partial to the weed myself... I sometimes forget that it disagrees with others.
A gentleman doesn't smoke in the presence of a lady.
Three weeks ago, I took a bullet out of a man who was shot by a gentleman.
The bullet was in his back.
- Do you mean to insinuate -
- Sit down, mister. Doc don't mean no harm.
Be careful of old Bessie up there now.
Take it easy. Hold it steady, girl.
Prepare to dismount! Take a look and see if there isn't a stone bruising' that honk down there.
If it isn't my old friend, Sergeant Billy Pinkett!
How are ya, Billy?
- He's fine, Doc, and mighty glad to see ya! Didn't figure on no stagecoach comin' through... with them Apaches raisin' Cain.
I was just telling Billy to hitch up the buckboard so we could get the young ones in -
Wait a minute! You mean to say there are no troops at this station?
Ain't no soldiers here but What you see.
But my husband, Captain Mallory - l was told he was here.
He was, dearie.
Got orders night afore last to join the soldiers at Apache Wells.
- That means we gotta go back.
- l can't go back!
Driver, you started this coach for Lordsburg, and it's your duty to get us there. And it's your duty, young man, to come along with us!
It's my duty, Mr. Gatewood, to obey orders.
I'm sorry, sir. Well, if the soldiers go back, Lieutenant, that means we all have to go back?
My orders are to return from here immediately, and I can't disobey those orders.
I think we can get through all right, Curley.
Now, don't egg him on, Kid. I'm drivin' this here outfit, and, well, if the soldiers go back, so am I.
I call this a desertion of duty. I'll report you to your superior officer.
If necessary, I'll take the matter up with Washington!
That's your privilege, sir, but if you give us any trouble here...
I'll have to put you under restraint. Now, don't lose your temper.
don't lose your temper. I'll tell you how we'll settle it.
We'll take a vote. Inside, everybody. Come on, Buck.
Curley, I don't wanna go to -
Now you girls set yourselves down. I'll get you something to eat.
Now, folks, if we push on, we can be in Apache Wells by sundown.
Soldiers there will give us an escort as far as the ferry.
Then it's only a hoot and a holler into Lordsburg.
- Well, that old mare, I don't - - We've got four men can handle firearms. Five with you, Ringo.
Doc can shoot, if sober.
I can shoot? I can shoot?
Now, Miss Mallory, I - l ain't gonna put a lady in danger without she votes for it.
I've traveled all the way here from Virginia. I'm determined to get to my husband.
I won't be separated any longer.
- What's your vote, mister?
- Well - Where's your manners, Curley?
Ain't you gonna ask the other lady first?
Well, what do you say?
What difference does it make?
Doesn't matter.
I vote that we go on. I demand it. I'm standing on my legal rights.
What do you say, Hatfield?
Lordsburg.
Four.
You, Doc?
I'm not only a philosopher, sir. I'm a fatalist.
Somewhere, sometime, there may be the right bullet or the wrong bottle... waiting for Josiah Boone.
- Why worry when or where?
- Yes or no? Having that philosophy, sir, I've always courted danger.
During the late war, when I had the honor to serve the Union... under our great president, Abraham Lincoln... and General Phil Sheridan... well, sir, I fought 'midst shot and shell and cannon roar!
- Do you want to go back or not?
- No! I want another drink.
That's five.
How about you, Mr. Hancock?
It's Peacock. I'd like to go on, brother. I want to reach the bosom of my dear family in Kansas City, Kansas, as quickly as possible... but I may never reach that bosom if we go on.
So, under the circumstances - You understand, brother - l think it best we go back with the bosoms - l mean, the soldiers.
One against.
Well, Buck? - l want - - Buck says aye.
Ain't nothin' keeping me out of Lordsburg, Curley.
There sure ain't.
Well, folks, that settles it. We're going through. Sit down, folks, and eat your grub.
We'll change them horses. - But, Curley, ain't we gonna eat?
- You can eat later!
Here you are, folks. Food's on the table. Help yourselves.
You got a long ride ahead of ya. You ain't drinking', Billy.
Sit down here, ma'am.
Thanks.
May I find you another place, Mrs. Mallory?
It's cooler by the window.
Thank you.
Looks like I got the plague, don't it?
No. No, it's not you.
Well, I guess you can't break out of prison and into society in the same week.
Please! Please.
You're ill, Mrs. Mallory.
No, it's just that I -
I'll be all right.
You've been very kind. Why?
In the world I live in, one doesn't often meet a lady, Mrs. Mallory.
Have you ever been in Virginia?
I was in your father's regiment.
I should remember your name.
You're Mr. Hatfield. That's what I'm called, yes.
- Why do you look at me like that?
- I'm just tryin' to remember.
Ain't I seen you someplace before, ma'am?
No. No, you haven't.
I wish I had though.
I know you.
I mean, I know who you are.
I guess everybody in the territory does.
Yep.
Well, I used to be a good cowhand, but... things happened.
Yeah, that's it. Things happened.
And now they'll take you back to prison.
Not till I finish a job in Lordsburg.
But you can't. You're going there as a prisoner.
All aboard for Apache Wells, Lee's Fer -
All righty, folks, the horses are changed. We'd better get going.
- And Lordsburg, maybe.
- All right, get going, Ringo. Mrs. Pinkett, tell Billy the buckboard is all ready.
All right, Marshal, we're ready. - Come on, folks, let's move.
- My compliments to your husband. Thank you. I still feel that we ought to go back with the soldiers.
Bridesmaid! Baby!
Yow! - What'd you say?
- Nothin'.
Well, why don't ya say somethin'? A fella gets nervous, sittin' here like a dummy, nothin' to think about but the Indians.
You say something!
You've been sitting there all day talking without making any sense!
All right, I'll say somethin' that makes sense.
If I was you, I'd let 'em shoot it out.
- Let who?
- Luke Plummer and the Kid.
There'd be a lot more peace in this territory... if that Luke Plummer was so full of lead he couldn't hold his liquor.
I ain't sayin' l don't share your sentiments, Buck.
- But you're a born fool.
- Well, I know that. In the first place, Luke would kill the Kid in a gunfight.
In the second place, if Luke did get shot, he's got two brothers just as ornery as he is. Nah, the only safe place for Ringo is in the pen, and I aim to get him there all in one piece!
Well, I'll be doggoned if I didn't do you an injury, Curley. - l figured you were after the reward.
- Reward? Why, the Kid's old man and me was friends. We used to punch cattle together.
Besides, I could use that 500 in gold.
- Bridesmaid!
- Steady! Steady, girl! Bridesmaid!
In line! I can't get over the impertinence of that young lieutenant.
I'll make it warm for that shave-tail! I'll report him to Washington!
We pay taxes to the government, and what do we get?
- Not even protection from the army.
- No. I don't know what the government is coming to.
Instead of protecting businessmen, it pokes its nose into business. Hmph!
Why, they're even talking now about having bank examiners.
As if we bankers don't know how to run our own banks!
Why, Boone, I actually had a letter from a popinjay official... saying they were going to inspect my books!
I have a slogan that should be blazoned on every newspaper in the country -
America for Americans! The government must not interfere with business!
Reduce taxes!
Our national debt is something shocking! Over $1 billion a year!
What this country needs is a businessman for president!
What this country needs is more fuddle.
- What?
- Fuddle!
You're drunk, sir!
I'm happy, Gatewood. Boo!
How come you're taking this road?
It's gonna be cold up there.
I'm usin' my head.
Those breech-clad Apaches don't like snow.
Maybe you'd like to - to sit next to me.
I - You could put your head on my shoulder.
No, thank you.
How are you feeling, Mrs. Mallory?
is there any water?
Driver! Canteen, please!
Just a minute, Mrs. Mallory.
Haven't I seen this crest before?
Isn't this from Greenfield Manor?
I wouldn't know, Mrs. Mallory. I - l won this cup on a wager.
How about the other lady?
Thanks.
Sorry. No silver cups.
This is fine.
No.
Please, Doctor.
Yow, girls!
Whoa, steady.
Ho.
Howdy, Chris.
Seven hours from Dry Fork.
Pretty fast driving', amigo!
Get the folks a bite to eat, Chris, while we change horses. We're pushing on to Lordsburg.
You come without soldiers?
We weren't a-scared.
We didn't see one Apache, did we, Curley?
- Where's the cavalry, Chris?
- Where's the soldiers? There ain't no soldiers.
Soldiers have gone.
Where's Captain Mallory?
Where's my husband?
Where is he?
You're his wife, I think?
Yes. Where is he?
Did he go with his men?
Sí, senora.
Little what you call it - scrimmage with the Apaches last night.
Soldiers take Captain Mallory to Lordsburg. I think he get hurt maybe.
Badly?
Sí, senora.
I think so.
Mrs. Mallory, I'm awfully sorry.
If there's anything I can -
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Marshal! Come here! Quickly!
Come on, Doc.
Let's go, Doc.
- Poor woman. - A sink woman on our hands! - That's all we needed!
- I feel kinda sink myself.
We're in a fine fix, my friends. It's a fine country we're living in. The army has no right to leave a public place like this undefended.
Looks to me like the army's got its hands pretty full, mister.
- Have you a wife? - Sí, senora., I think.
- Call her. - Yakima!
¿Dónde estás?
Ringo, go in the kitchen and get some hot water, lots of hot water, please. Yes, ma'am. Hey, Chris!
A fine member of the medical profession.
Drunken beast.
Coffee.
Give me coffee.
Black coffee.
Lots of it.
- More! More! More!
That's four. - Blacker! Stronger!
Keep it comin', Curley! - You'll have it coming out your ears in a minute.
Drink it down, Doc. Go on.
Drink it down. - Get it down.
- That'll make you feel better.
All right, Doc.
Isn't that drunken swine sober yet?
- He's doing the best he can! - Well, hurry! - Shh!
- Tin-horn. - How you feeling? - Fine.
Thanks. Again.
Sit down here, Doc.
Keep the fire going, Chris. - Plenty of hot water. - Sí, senor.
Savages!
That's my wife, Yakima.
My squaw.
Yes, but she's - she's savage!
Sí, senor. She a little bit savage, I think. Come on, hurry.
Something funny about this. That woman's an Apache.
Sure, she's one of Geronimo people, I think. Maybe not so bad to have Apache wife?
Apache don't bother me, I think.
- All right, Doc?
- All right.
All right, Dallas.
Ringo!
It's them vaqueros! They've run away!
Yeah, with the spare horses.
Them coyotes give me the creeps. It sounds li - Well, it sounds just like a baby.
Black eight.
It's a baby.
It's a little girl.
It's a little girl. Well, I'll be doggoned.
How's Mrs. Mallory?
She's going to be all right.
Well, I'll be doggoned.
- Did-Did you know?
- Why -
Well, I'll be doggoned.
don't do that.
Dr. Boone.
Come on, boys. Three cheers for ole' Doc Boone.
- Hip, hip - - Quiet.
- Well, we oughta be - - Quiet.
Mrs. Mallory.
Kid, I know why you want to go to Lordsburg.
I like you. I know your pop. He was good friend of mine.
If you know who in Lordsburg, you stay away, I think.
You mean Luke Plummer?
Luke, Ike and Hank - all there together. I saw them.
- Are you sure of that, Chris?
- Sure. I can tell you the truth.
- l know.
- Thanks. - That's all I wanted to know.
- You crazy if you go.
I think you stay away, Kid. Three against one is no good.
You oughtn't to go too far, Miss Dallas.
Apaches like to sneak up and pick off strays.
You, visiting' in Lordsburg?
No.
No, I have friends there. And maybe I can find work.
Say, look, Kid, why don't you try to escape?
- Why don't you get away?
- l aim to - in Lordsburg. Why Lordsburg?
Why don't you make for the border now?
My father and brother were shot down by the Plummer boys.
Guess you don't know how it feels to lose your own folks that way.
I lost mine when I was a kid.
There was a massacre on Superstition Mountain.
That's tough, especially on a girl.
Well, you gotta live no matter what happens.
Yeah. That's it.
Look, Miss Dallas, you got no folks.
And neither have I, and, well... maybe I'm taking a lot for granted, but -
I watched you with that baby... that other woman's baby.
You looked, well -
Well, I still got a ranch across the border. And it's a nice place, a real nice place.
Trees and grass, water.
A man could live there... and a woman.
Will you go?
But you don't know me. You don't know who I am.
I know all I want to know.
Will you go?
don't talk like that.
What are you doing out here, Kid?
Stick close to the reservation.
Curley!
- What's wrong, Chris? - My wife, Yakima - she run away.
- When I wake up, she was gone. - The way you come busting in here, you'd think - - Whoa.
- Excuse me, Kid.
Come busting in here, you'd think we were being attacked.
- You can find another wife.
- Sure I can find another wife. But she take my rifle and my horse. I never sell her.
I love her so much.
I beat her with the whip, and she never get tired.
- Your wife? - No. My horse.
I can find another wife easy, yes, but not a horse like that.
Mala Yakima. I knew that woman was a thief, by -
What's the matter with you, Gatewood?
My valise! Where's my valise?
Which one of you have got it?
Here it is. I was usin' it for a pillow.
I didn't think you'd mind. I thought I told you to keep your hands off my things!
Yes, sir.
That squaw of yours will find some Apaches and bring 'em back here.
My wife's people don't bother me, I think.
Well, they bother me, I think.
Chris, is this bar open?
Sure, all the time, senor. Sí. Good.
Here you are, Doc.
Well, what are we wasting time for?
Let's make a break for it.
- We've got a sick woman to think of.
- Do you want her to stay here and be butchered with the rest of us?
- Why don't you think of somebody else for once? - Do you realize who you're talking to?
Easy, easy! Quiet, boys.
Quiet. We ain't been butchered yet.
But you're right.
We'd better get going for Lordsburg as soon as we can.
Might be a good idea, Curley, if, Doc took a look at the patient.
Yeah, and Little Coyote.
You'll join me, Doctor?
No, thanks.
Morning.
Well, you're looking pretty chipper.
You're up early, Dallas.
She didn't go to bed, Doctor.
I'm afraid she sat up all night while I slept.
I slept a lot in the chair.
Well, anyway, it was nice to stay awake and hold the baby.
Well, we've got to get you to Lordsburg, Little Coyote. That's what the boys christened her last night when she squalled
- Little Coyote.
- How do you feel? - Fine, thanks. A little tired.
- Doctor, do you think my husband -
- Never mind him.
The best medicine he can have is to see you two safe and sound. You just make up your mind you're gonna get there.
- l have made up my mind.
- That's the stuff. - l am going to get there. - You need strength, so get all the rest you can.
Dallas, do you suppose you can fix up a little broth?
- She has already.
- Good. How about making some coffee for the boys?
Now you get some sleep, Mrs. Mallory.
And don't look so proud.
I've brought hundreds of those little fellas into the world... once upon a time.
And the new one was always the prettiest.
Doc.
Ringo asked me to marry him.
is that wrong for a girl like me?
If a man and woman love each other, it's all right, ain't it, Doc?
You're going to be hurt, child.
Worse than you've ever been hurt.
don't you know that boy's headed back for prison?
Besides, if you two go into Lordsburg together... he's going to know all about you.
He's not goin' into Lordsburg.
All I want is for you to tell me it's all right.
Gosh, child, who am I to tell you what's right or wrong?
All right.
Go ahead.
Good luck.
Thanks, Doc.
- Ringo - - Well, Doc?
Both doing nicely. She's a real soldier's wife, that young lady.
Good, good.
Then we can leave immediately.
Well, not for a day or so if you want my professional advise.
What do you mean a day?
Stay another day?
Why? Where were you when the stork came last night, Gatewood?
I refuse to allow Mrs. Mallory to travel until she and the child are out of danger.
What do you mean danger? Aren't we in worse danger here?
I don't wish to intrude. But I've had five children. I mean, my dear wife has.
And much as I dislike discussing it, in this hour of our trial... I - l believe the doctor's right.
Spoken like a man, Reverend.
I say we ought to leave here before the Apaches find us.
That's common sense. I wish you were 1 0 years younger, Gatewood.
- don't let my white hairs stop you - - Now just a minute! Quiet!
Quiet! - Now, Curley, I haven't said a word!
- Will you shut up!
Now, if we argue this thing out right, we can get somewhere. Let's all sit down and talk sensible.
Come on, Buck. Sit down.
There's a young woman in the kitchen making coffee. She needs help.
Thanks, Doc.
Say, Kid.
How old were you when you went to the pen?
I was... goin' on 17.
Mornin', ma'am. Morning.
I, laid awake most of the night... wondering what you'd have said if Curley hadn't busted in.
Guess you was up kind of late too. I could hear you moving around.
You didn't answer what I asked you last night.
Look, Kid, why don't you try to escape?
There's a horse out there in the corral.
Curley won't go after you because he can't leave the passengers in a fix like this.
I gotta go to Lordsburg. Why don't you go to my ranch and wait for me?
Wait for a dead man.
You haven't got a chance.
It was three against one when the Plummers swore that you killed their foreman, got you sent up.
It'll be three against one in Lordsburg.
Well, there's some things a man just can't run away from.
How can you talk about your life and my life when you're throwing them away?
Yeah. Mine too. That's what you're throwing away if you go to Lordsburg.
What do you want me to do?
Would it make us any happier if Luke Plummer was dead?
One of his brothers would be after you with a gun. We'd never be safe.
I don't want that kind of life, Ringo.
Well, I don't see what else I can do.
Go now. Get away. Forget Lordsburg.
Forget the Plummers. Make for the border, and I'll come to you.
- Do you mean that?
- Yes, I do. Will you go with me, Dallas?
I can't leave Mrs. Mallory and the baby.
I'll come to you from Lordsburg. I swear it.
Well, I oughta have a rifle and -
I've got one.
Right here. - l got it last night when they were all asleep.
- You mean you thought of this last night? Yeah. don't ask any more questions.
Not now.
Aw, gosh, Curley, there ain't no Apaches behind us. We can still go back to Τonto.
- No! I insist we go on to Lordsburg.
- What do you think, Chris?
Geronimo between here and Lordsburg - with my horse, I think.
Quiet, Doc. This is a serious matter, ain't it?
My dear Buck... if I have only one hour to live, I'm going to enjoy myself.
Doctor, I don't begrudge you my samples, but I think -
Now you hush! I've stood enough of you.
Now this is a serious problem, and I'm the only one that's talkin' sense.
- Now, Curley, if - - lf we can get across that ferry, we'll be all right.
Question is, what are we gonna do about the lady and her baby?
Dr. Boone has settled that for us, sir... and I demand respect for his professional opinion.
Hatfield.
Ringo.
Ringo!
Hurry, Ringo. - Ringo!
- Hurry! - Bye, Dallas. - Good-bye!
Ringo! don't stop! Go on!
Ringo, go on! Go on! Curley!
You don't need them, Curley.
- l ain't gonna run away. - I'll say you ain't. Look at them hills.
- Apaches. - War signals.
Hurry up, Marshal! What's - Why don't we start?
Nine girls! Yow!
Go! Hey, Curley, why don't you take the cuffs off the Kid?
- He's mighty handy with a gun.
- You drive them horses. I'll take care of the Kid.
Can't you drive any faster?
You think-headed lout!
We've got to make that ferry.
A man works all his life to get a hold of some money so that he can enjoy life... and has to run into a trap like this.
A trap, brother? You mean the Apaches?
There's been no sign of them. You don't see any signs of them.
They strike like rattlesnakes. If you hadn't insisted on waiting for her, we'd have been across the ferry by this time.
You talk too much, Gatewood.
Your threats don't faze me, Hatfield.
You're nothing but a tin-horn gambler.
How would you like to get out and walk? You can't put me out of a public conveyance.
Now, now, gentlemen. Gentlemen.
Take it easy, Gatewood. We may need that fight before we get to the ferry.
You wouldn't be much good in a fight, you jailbird!
Leave the Kid alone. He's handcuffed.
Gentlemen, please. Let's not forget the ladies, bless them.
Let's have a little Christian charity one for the other.
Well, folks, we're coming in to Lee's Ferry now. Lordsburg - next stop!
Curley, look. Look at the ferry. It's burnt too.
Hatfield, stand guard over there.
Where's the army?
What are the soldiers doing?
- Curley, what can I do?
- Are they going to let Geronimo burn and pillage the whole country? Ringo, I need you.
Will you give me your word you won't try to escape again?
I'll give you my word - till Lordsburg.
- Get in the coach with them women. - l gave you my word. - Ringo, don't!
Buck, drive into the river up to the hubs. Brownie!
Whoa, Duchess! Come on, baby!
Kid, take your suspenders and cross-tie them wheelers.
Sorry about the saddle, Kid.
- Ready, Kid?
- All set.
- Ready, Buck?
- All ready, Curley. Here we go! Here we go, Buck!
Hyah! Just sit quiet, folks. You'll be all right.
Lordsburg - Hey, Curley.
- Yeah.
What? You think I ought to charge Mrs. Mallory's baby half fare?
Sweetheart!
Well, we'll soon be in Lordsburg.
Sorry I flew off the handle, Hatfield.
My apologies, Doctor.
No hard feelings, I hope. All in all, it's been an exciting, very interesting trip.
Has it not? Well, now that the danger's passed, Mr. -
Peacock.
Ladies and gentlemen, since it's most unlikely... that we'll ever have the pleasure of meeting again socially...
I'd like to propose a toast.
Major...
Gatewood...
Ringo.
- To your health. - Thank you, sir.
Giddap, girl!
Dry Lake! Ringo! Git, girls!
- l warned you about this - this danger!
- But you wouldn't listen to me!
Gatewood, will you shut up!
I've got a patient here! No, you can't stop me.
Let me out of here, I tell you! - Will you shut up! - You sot!
Yaah! Yow! Yow!
Hey, Kid! Ringo!
Kid! Kid!
The leaders, Kid! Get the leaders!
Curley! More ammunition!
Do you hear it?
It's a bugle!
They're blowing the charge!
If you see Judge Greenfield... tell him his son -
- Thank heaven you're safe, Lucy.
- Where's Richard? is he all right? He's all right.
Don't you worry. - lt isn't a bad wound.
- We'll take you to him immediately.
Where's the baby, dear?
I'll take the baby.
Dallas.
If there's ever anything I can do for - l know.
Orderly.
It's the Ringo Kid!
Yeah!
Aces and eights.
Dead man's hand, Luke.
Ringo Kid's in town. Yeah. Drivin' the stage.
- Mis hermanos. - Sí, patrón. Un momento.
Cash in.
Easy now. Easy.
That's right.
Good-bye, Miss Dallas.
If you ever come to Kansas City, Kansas, I want you to come out to see us.
- Thanks, Mr., - - Peacock.
- Hello, Buck. - They got here all right.
- You got through all right.
- All right, folks, you're here.
All right, folks. You're all right. Unload.
Well, Lordsburg.
Thank you...and you, Doctor.
There you are. Thank you.
Well, Kid.
Curley, how long will they give me for breakin' out?
About another year.
- You know where my ranch is?
- Yeah.
Will you see that she gets there all right?
Dallas.
Yeah. This is no town for a girl like her.
Will you do it?
- Sure.
- Thanks. How are ya, Marshal?
Get my man through all right?
I don't need them. If you don't want to lose your prisoner, Sheriff, you'd better take care of him yourself.
- What's your name, mister?
- My name is Gatewood.
Ellsworth H. Gatewood. Oh..
Gatewood. You didn't think they'd have the telegraph wires fixed, did you?
You thought you escaped.
Can I meet you back here in 10 minutes?
I gave you my word, Curley. I ain't goin' back on it now.
No ammunition.
I lied to you, Curley.
Got three left.
Come on.
Good night, Kid.
- ls this where you live?
- No. I gotta know where you live, don't I?
No. don't come any further.
It's all been a crazy dream. I've been out of my mind just hopin'.
Say good-bye here, Kid.
We ain't never gonna say good-bye.
Could I have that?
Give me the shotgun. Shotgun!
Luke! Luke, please don't!
Well, Kid, I - l told you not to follow me.
Dallas.
I asked you to marry me, didn't I?
I'll never forget you asked me, Kid.
That's something.
Wait here.
Ringo said he'll be passing this way in...
I'll take that shotgun, Luke.
You'll take it in the belly if you don't get out of my way.
I'll have you indicted for murder if you step outside with that shotgun.
We'll attend to you later.
Don't ever let me do that again.
Luke.
Hey, Billy! Billy, kill that story about the Republican convention in Chicago and take this down!
"The Ringo Kid was killed on Main Street in Lordsburg tonight!
...and among the additional dead was" - Leave that blank for a spell.
- l didn't hear any shooting', Ed.
- You will, Billy. You will.
Hank missed him - at four feet.
Ringo.
Ringo.
Ready, Kid?
Thanks, Curley.
Curley's gonna see that you get to my place across the border.
Well, good-bye, Dallas.
Good-bye.
Maybe you'd like to ride a ways with the Kid.
Please.
Well, they're saved from the blessings of civilization.
Yeah.
Doc?
I'll, uh, buy you a drink.
Just one.
Call off your ungodly dogs!
Down!
Quiet! Down!
Are you Mr. Heathcliff?
Well, I'm Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant at the Grange.
I'm lost. I--
Can I get a guide from amongst your lads?
No, you cannot. I've only got one, and he's needed here.
Well, then, I'll have to stay till morning.
Do as you please.
Quiet! Down!
Thank you for your hospitality. Could you extend it to a cup of tea?
- Shall I?
- You heard him ask for it.
Thank you.
I presume the amiable lady is Mrs. Heathcliff?
Would it be taxing your remarkable hospitality if I sat down?
I hope my hospitality will teach you... not to make rash journeys on these moors.
As for staying here, I don't keep accommodations for visitors.
You can share a bed with one of the servants.
Thanks. I'll sleep in a chair, sir.
No. A stranger is a stranger.
Guests are so rare in this house that I hardly know how to receive them.
I and my dog.
Joseph, open up one of the upstairs rooms.
Here's a room for thee, sir.
Bridal chamber.
Nobody slept here for years.
It's a trifle depressing.
- Can you light a fire?
- No fire will burn in yonder grate.
Chimbley's all blocked up.
Very well. Thanks.
Good night.
I said good night.
Heathcliff!
Let me in!
I'm lost on the moors!
- It's Cathy!
- Help! Mr. Heathcliff!
There's somebody out!
Oh, Mr. Heathcliff!
There's someone out there. It's a woman. I heard her calling.
She said her name. Cathy. That was it!
Cathy?
Oh, I must have been dreaming. Forgive me.
Get out of this room. Get out!
Get out, I tell you!
Cathy! Come in!
Cathy, come back to me.
Oh, do come once more.
Oh, my heart's darling!
Cathy. My own--
My--
Where's he going in the storm?
She calls him... and he follows her out onto the moor.
He's mad! He's like a madman.
He seized me by the collar and flung me out.
You see, I had a dream.
I thought I heard a voice calling.
I reached out to close the shutter, and something touched me.
Something cold and clinging, like an icy hand.
And then I saw her. A woman.
Then my senses must have become disordered because the falling snow... shaped itself into what looked like a phantom, but there was nothing.
It was Cathy.
Who is Cathy?
A girl who died.
Oh, no, I don't believe in ghosts.
I don't believe in phantoms sobbing through the night.
- Poor Cathy.
- I don't believe life comes back... once it's died and calls again to the living.
No, I don't.
Maybe if I told you her story, you'd change your mind... about the dead coming back.
Maybe you'd know, as I do... that there is a force that brings them back... if their hearts were wild enough in life.
Tell me her story.
It began 40 years ago... when I was young... in the service of Mr. Earnshaw...
Cathy's father.
Wuthering Heights was a lovely place in those days... full of summertime and youth and happy voices.
One day Mr. Earnshaw was returning from a visit to Liverpool.
- You'll not catch me!
- Yes, I will!
Cathy, go wash! I don't want your father to see you in that dress.
You too, Hindley. Hurry up, now.
I don't want to get washed!
Come along!
I'll tell your father not to give you the present he's bringing.
- What's he bringing?
- Go along upstairs.
Joseph says his horse is coming over the hill.
Evening, Mr. Earnshaw.
- Hello, Joseph.
- Hello, neighbor Earnshaw.
- How are you, Dr. Kenneth?
- Back so soon?
What in the world have you got there?
A gift of God.
Although it's as dark as if he came from the devil.
- Quiet, me bonny lad, we're home.
- He's a dour-looking individual.
Aye, and with reason.
I found him starving in Liverpool... kicked and bruised and almost dead.
So you kidnapped him.
Not until I spent two pounds trying to find out who its owner was.
But nobody would claim him, so I brought him home.
- Giddap!
- Here, here!
Come on, you young imp of Satan. Off with ye.
- Cathy, Hindley!
- Welcome home. The children are coming.
Don't look so shocked, Ellen.
He's going to live with us for a while.
Give him a good scrubbing... and put some Christian clothes on him.
Food is what he needs most, Mr. Earnshaw.
He's as thin as a sparrow. Come into the kitchen, child.
Cathy! Hindley!
- Father, what did you bring me?
- Hello, Father!
There you are. It's what you've always wanted.
A riding crop. Be careful how you use it.
- Oh, it's wonderful!
- I'm so glad you got back soon.
- It's wonderful! - Ow!
Father, make her stop!
No, children.
This is Hindley's violin.
One of the best in Liverpool.
Here. Fine tone.
And a bow to go with it.
Here you are, Paganini.
Who's that?
- He was hungry as a wolf.
- Oh, children.
This is a little gentleman I met in Liverpool who will pay us a visit.
He-
- He's dirty.
Oh, no. Don't make me ashamed of you, Cathy.
When he's been scrubbed, show him Hindley's room.
- He'll sleep there.
- In my room?
He can't. I won't let him.
Children, you may as well learn now that you must share what you have... with others not as fortunate as yourselves.
- Take charge of the lad, Ellen.
- Come along, child.
What's your name?
We'll call him Heathcliff.
Heathcliff, I'll race you to the barn.
The loser has to be the slave.
Come on!
Faster!
Come on!
Whoa. I won!
You're my slave! You have to do as I say. Water my horse and groom it!
Oh, that's not fair! It's too real.
- What do you want?
- This horse.
- You can't have him. He's mine!
- Mine's lame. I'm riding yours.
Give him to me or I'll tell Father you boasted you'd turn me out when he died!
That's a lie! I never said such a thing.
- He didn't!
- You never had a father!
You gypsy beggar! You can't have mine!
Stop that!
- Heathcliff, look out!
- Don't come near me!
Let him go! You killed him!
I'm going to tell Father. He'll punish you for this.
You can't go near him till he's well.
- You heard Dr. Kenneth!
- Are you hurt badly?
Talk to me.
Why don't you cry? Heathcliff, don't look like that!
How can I pay him back?
I don't care how long I wait... if I can only pay him back.
Come. Let's pick harebells on Penistone Crag.
You can ride Jane.
Please, milord?
- Oh, Heathcliff.
- Whoa, Jane.
- You're so handsome when you smile.
- Don't make fun of me.
Don't you know that you're handsome? Do you know what I've told Ellen?
- You're a prince in disguise.
- You did?
I said your father was the emperor of China and your mother an Indian queen.
It's true, Heathcliff.
You were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England.
But I'm glad. I've always wanted to know somebody of noble birth.
All the princes I ever read about had castles.
Of course. They captured them. You must capture one too.
There's a beautiful castle that lies waiting for your lance, Sir Prince.
You mean Penistone Crag? Aw, that's just a rock.
If you can't see that's a castle, you'll never be a prince.
Here, take your lance and charge!
See that black knight at the drawbridge? Challenge him!
Charge!
I challenge you to mortal combat, Black Knight!
Heathcliff! You've killed him! You've killed the black knight!
He's earned it for all his wicked deeds.
Oh, it's a wonderful castle.
- Heathcliff, let's never leave it.
- Never in our lives!
Let all the world confess, there is not a more beautiful damsel... than the Princess Catherine of Yorkshire.
But I'm still your slave.
No, Cathy. I now make you my queen.
Whatever happens out there, here you will always be my queen.
How is he, Doctor?
He is at peace.
Send for the vicar, Joseph.
My dear, wild little Cathy.
You may come up and pray beside him now.
You're not wanted up there.
My father is past your wheedling.
Go and help the stable boys harness the horse for the vicar.
Do as you're told. I'm master here now.
And as the children grew up, Hindley was indeed master of Wuthering Heights.
It was no longer the happy home of their childhood.
- Joseph, bring me another bottle.
- That's the third, Mr. Hindley.
The third or the twenty-third, bring me another.
Wine is a mocker. Strong drink is raging, Master Hindley.
Stop spouting scripture and do as you're told, you croaking old parrot.
Yes, Master Hindley.
Sit down, Cathy, till you're excused from the table.
Joseph, fill Miss Cathy's glass.
Oh, my little sister disapproves of drinking.
Well, I know some people who don't.
Heathcliff, saddle my horse. Be quick about it, you gypsy beggar.
I told you to be quick.
Look at this stable. It's a pigsty.
Is this the way you do your work?
Clean it up.
I want this floor cleaned and scrubbed tonight.
Don't stand there showing your teeth. Give me a hand up.
I want your work done when I come back at dawn, do you hear?
Oh, you're hoping I won't come back.
You're hoping I'll fall and break my neck, aren't you?
Aren't you?
Well, come on, Heathcliff.
Heathcliff, where are you going?
Come back!
- Did Joseph see which way you came?
- What does it matter?
Nothing's real down there. Our life is here.
Yes, milord.
The clouds are lowering over Gimmerton Head.
See how the light is changing?
It would be dreadful if Hindley ever found out.
Found out what?
That you talk to me once in a while?
I shouldn't talk to you at all.
Look at you! You get worse every day.
Dirty and unkempt and in rags.
Why aren't you a man?
Heathcliff, why don't you run away?
Run away? From you?
You could come back rich and take me away.
Why aren't you my prince like we said long ago?
- Why can't you rescue me?
- Come with me now.
- Where?
- Anywhere!
And live in haystacks and steal our food from the marketplaces?
No. That's not what I want.
You just want to send me off. That won't do.
I've stayed here and been beaten like a dog.
Abused and cursed and driven mad, but I stayed just to be near you.
Even as a dog! I'll stay till the end.
I'll live and I'll die under this rock.
Do you hear?
Music.
The Lintons are giving a party.
That's what I want.
Dancing and singing in a pretty world.
And I'm going to have it.
Come on. Let's go and see. Come on!
Isn't it wonderful?
Isn't she beautiful? That's the kind of dress I'll wear.
You'll have a red velvet coat with silver buckles on your shoes.
Oh, will we ever?
Quick.
- Hold him, Skulker, Flash!
- Call off your dogs, you fools!
Stay where you are. There's nothing to be alarmed about.
- Who is it?
- I don't know.
Please, back into the ballroom.
- Let me go!
- Hold that man.
Hold onto him!
- Who is it Edgar?
- Catherine Earnshaw, Father.
- Who's this with her?
- Their stable boy.
She's bleeding. Bring hot water, Isabella, and bandages.
- Yes. How badly is she hurt?
- Can't tell.
Send Robert to get Dr. Kenneth in the shay. Hurry.
- You'll pay for this!
- Hold your tongue, insolent rascal!
- Get out of this house.
- I won't go without Cathy.
Father, please, she's in pain.
Go on. Run away.
Bring me back the world.
- Pack this fellow off.
- I'm going.
I'm going from here and from this cursed country both.
Throw him out!
But I'll be back in this house one day, Judge Linton. I'll pay you out.
I'll bring this house down in ruins about your heads.
That's my curse on you!
On all of you!
And so Cathy found herself in this new world... she had so often longed to enter.
After some happy weeks, Mr. Edgar brought her back to Wuthering Heights.
Welcome home, Miss Cathy! How do you do, Mr. Linton?
Don't stir! I'll get Joseph to carry you.
Carry her? She runs like a little goat.
Ellen, I've been dancing, night after night!
Oh, how beautiful you look!
Wherever did you get that beautiful dress?
Mr. Linton's sister lent it to me. Isn't it wonderful?
Edgar, do come in for tea.
As soon as the horses have been seen to.
I'll find someone.
Is he here?
He came back last week with great talk... of lying in a lake of fire without you-- how he had to see you to live.
He's unbearable. Where could he be, the scoundrel?
Why did you stay so long in that house?
I didn't expect to find you here.
Why did you stay so long?
Why? Because I was having a wonderful time.
A delightful, fascinating, wonderful time... among human beings.
Go and wash your face and hands, and comb your hair... so that I needn't be ashamed of you in front of a guest.
What are you doing in this part of the house?
Look after Mr. Linton's horses.
Let him look after his own.
- I've already done so.
- Apologize to Mr. Linton at once.
Bring in some tea, please.
- Cathy.
- Yes, Edgar?
I cannot understand how your brother can allow that gypsy in the house.
Don't talk about him.
How can you, a gentlewoman, tolerate him under your roof?
A roadside beggar giving himself airs of equality. How can you?
What do you know about Heathcliff?
- All I need or want to know.
- He was my friend long before you.
- That blackguard?
- Blackguard and all, he belongs here.
Speak well of him or get out!
- Are you out of your senses?
- Stop calling those I love names!
Those you love?
Cathy, what possesses you? Do you realize the things you're saying?
I'm saying that I hate you.
I hate the look of your milk-white face.
I hate the touch of your soft, foolish hands.
That gypsy's evil soul has got into you.
- Yes, it's true!
- That beggar's dirt is on you!
Yes! Now get out!
My dear.
Leave me alone.
Forgive me, Heathcliff.
Make the world stop right here.
Make everything stop and stand still and never move again.
Make the moors never change and you and I never change.
The moors and I will never change.
- Don't you, Cathy.
- I can't.
No matter what I ever do or say, this is me now.
Standing on this hill with you.
This is me forever.
Come.
When you went away, what did you do? Where did you go?
I went to Liverpool.
One night I shipped for America on a brigantine going to New Orleans.
We were held up by the tide, and I lay all night on the deck... thinking of you and the years and years ahead without you.
I jumped overboard and swam ashore.
I think I'd have died if you hadn't.
You're not thinking of that other world now.
Smell the heather.
Fill my arms with heather. All they can hold.
Come on.
You're still my queen!
And as time went by...
Cathy again was torn between her wild, uncontrollable passion for Heathcliff... and the new life she had found at the Grange... that she could not forget.
I got the soap in my eyes! Where's the towel?
- Oh, it's hot!
- No, it's just--
- It's hot!
- Don't do that!
Ellen, haven't you finished yet?
Supposing you're not ready when he gets here. Keep still.
Any young man that will come sniveling back after the way you treated him... you can keep waiting forever.
What's wrong with him, sending you perfume? Hasn't he any pride?
I sent my apologies, didn't I?
I can't believe this change in you, Miss Cathy.
Yesterday you were a harum-scarum child with dirty hands and a willful heart.
Look at you.
Oh, you're lovely, Miss Cathy. Lovely.
That's a very silly lie.
I'm not lovely. What I am is very brilliant.
- I have a wonderful brain.
- Indeed?
It enables me to be superior to myself.
There's nothing to be gained by just looking pretty like Isabella.
Every beauty mark must conceal a thought and every curl be full of humor... as well as brilliantine.
Such prattle. We--
Since when are you in the habit of entering my room, Heathcliff?
I want to talk to you. Go outside, Ellen.
I will not!
I take orders from Mistress Catherine, not stable boys.
Go outside.
All right, Ellen.
Now that we're so happily alone, may I know to what I owe this great honor?
- He's coming here again.
- You're utterly unbearable.
You didn't think so this morning on the moors.
- Well, my moods change indoors.
- Is he coming here?
- Of course not. Please go away.
- You're lying!
Why are you dressed up in a silk dress?
Because gentlefolk dress for dinner.
Not you. Why are you trying to win his puling flatteries?
I'm not a child. You can't talk like that to me.
I'm not talking to a child. I'm talking to my Cathy.
- Oh, I'm your Cathy?
- Yes!
I'm to take your orders and allow you to select my dresses?
You're not gonna simper in front of him, listening to his silly talk!
I'm not?
Well, I am. It's more entertaining that listening to a stable boy.
- Don't you talk like that.
- I will. Go away.
This is my room, a lady's room, not a room for servants with dirty hands.
Let me alone!
Yes.
Tell the dirty stable boy to let go of you.
He soils your pretty dress.
But who soils your heart? Not Heathcliff!
Who turns you into a vain, cheap, worldly fool?
Linton does!
You'll never love him, but you'll let yourself be loved to please your vanity.
Loved by that milksop with buckles on his shoes!
Stop it and get out!
You had your chance to be something else.
But thief or servant were all you were born to be, or beggar beside a road.
Not earning favors, but whimpering for them with your dirty hands!
That's all I've become to you:
a pair of dirty hands.
Well, have them then!
Have them where they belong!
It doesn't help to strike you.
Good evening, Ellen. I hope I'm not too early.
- Miss Cathy will be down in a minute.
- Thanks.
If you'll go into the parlor, I'll tell Miss Cathy you're here.
Half past eight. Unholy hour.
Doesn't he know, young fool, when it's time to go home?
That's Mr. Edgar now.
Go and fetch his horse.
- Take these apples into the larder.
- Yea, Lord.
Spare the righteous and smite the ungodly.
Stop your pratter.
- Good night, Joseph.
- Good night, sir.
Has he gone?
Your hands! What have you done?
Linton. Is he gone?
What have you done to your hands?
What have you been doing?
I want to crawl to her feet, whimper to be forgiven... for loving me, for needing her more than my own life... for belonging to her more than my own soul.
Don't let her see me.
I wondered whether you were still up. I have some news!
The kitchen is no place for that. Come into the parlor.
Come here. Sit down. Listen!
Can you keep a secret? Edgar's asked me to marry him.
- What did you tell him?
- That I'd give him my answer tomorrow.
Do you love him, Miss Cathy?
- Yes! Of course.
- Why?
Why? That's a silly question, isn't it?
No, not so silly. Why do you love him?
He's handsome and pleasant to be with.
- That's not enough.
- Because he'll be rich someday.
I'll be the finest lady in the county.
Now tell me how you love him.
I love the ground under his feet, the air above his head... and everything he touches.
What about Heathcliff?
Oh, Heathcliff. He gets worse every day.
It would degrade me to marry him.
I wish he hadn't come back.
It would be heaven to escape from this disorderly, comfortless place.
Well, if Master Edgar and his charms and money... and parties mean heaven to you... what's to keep you from taking your place among the Linton angels?
I don't think I belong in heaven.
I dreamt once I was there.
I dreamt I went to heaven, and it didn't seem to be my home.
I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth.
The angels were so angry, they flung me out in the middle of the heath... on top of Wuthering Heights.
I woke up sobbing with joy.
That's it, Ellen!
I have no more business marrying Edgar than I have of being in heaven.
But Ellen, what can I do?
You're thinking of Heathcliff.
Who else?
He's sunk so low. He seems to take pleasure in being brutal.
And yet... he's more myself than I am.
Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.
Linton's is as different as frost from fire.
My one thought in living is Heathcliff.
I am Heathcliff.
Everything he's suffered, I've suffered.
The little happiness he's ever known, I've had too.
If everything died and Heathcliff remained... life would still be full for me.
Hey, Heathcliff! Where's thee going?
Heathcliff! Come back!
He must have been listening.
- Listening to us?
- Yes.
Where?
How much did he hear?
I'm not sure, but I think... to where you said it would degrade you to marry him.
There's no use in calling. He's run away on master's best horse.
Come out of this storm! You'll catch your death of cold!
- He won't come back!
- Last time he did!
This time he won't. I know him.
- Which way did he go, Joseph?
- Yonder. Right on west moor.
- Come in! You must come in.
- The fool.
He should have known I love him. I love him!
Heathcliff, come back!
- Thank heaven you've come home!
- I told Joseph to stay awake!
- Do I unsaddle my own horse?
- You've got to go out again!
Miss Cathy's gone! They're looking for her-
- Joseph, everybody!
- Gone where?
- Out in the storm, hours ago.
Heathcliff ran away. He took a horse, and she went running after him.
- Oh, she did?
- Yes.
Don't stand there with your mouth open.
Fetch me a bottle and we'll celebrate.
Master Hindley, she'll die on the moors.
- You've got to help.
- Do as I tell you!
If she's gone off with that gypsy scum, let her run.
Let her run through storm and hell. They're birds of a feather.
The devil can take them both. Get me a bottle.
- Take her into the library.
- Get a fire in the east room.
And some brandy.
Turn this around to the fire.
- The brandy, Miss Isabella.
- Get some dry towels. Quickly.
- Where was she?
- The rocks on Penistone Crag... the life almost out of her.
Twenty drops in a glass of claret, well warmed.
Then add a lump of sugar.
There's nothing else I can tell you... except keep her in the sun and give her plenty of cream and butter.
In another month you'll be feeling like new.
- Good-bye, dear.
- Good-bye, Dr. Kenneth.
She'll be going home soon, Doctor.
What's needed is peace and orderliness in her life.
That's not to be found at Wuthering Heights.
- Has she mentioned him at all?
- Not since the delirium passed.
Sometimes fever can heal as well as destroy.
I made some inquiries in the village of the people who knew him.
- What did you hear?
- No sign nor hint of Heathcliff.
- He's disappeared into thin air.
- Heaven hope.
"... days and yon pursuits."
- Hello, Edgar.
- Isabella. How's our invalid?
- Much better I think.
- Let me have a look at her.
Where have you been all day? I've missed you.
Oh, this time of year every tenant has something to complain about.
I've been arguing with old Swithin... whether we'd build him a new pigsty.
Yes?
He decided we should.
I saw Hindley in the village this afternoon.
He wanted to know when you'll be coming home.
I wasn't very truthful. I told him Dr. Kenneth said it would be months.
Give me that. It's time for her medicine.
What did Dr. Kenneth say?
Twenty lumps of sugar in a glass-- No.
I'll go and ask Ellen.
Yes. Go and ask Ellen.
She's such a darling.
But you've all been so nice to me.
That's all I think about, how nice you are to me.
But still, I can't stay here forever.
Why not, Cathy... if I can make you happy?
You have made me happy, Edgar.
You've given me so much of your own self, your strength.
Darling, let me take care of you forever.
Let me guard you and love you always.
Would you love me always?
Yes.
It's so easy to love you.
Because I'm no longer wild and blackhearted and full of gypsy ways?
- No. I--
- Of course you were right, Edgar.
What you said long ago was true.
There was a strange curse on me.
Something that kept me from being myself.
Or at least from being what I wanted to be-- living in heaven.
How sweet you are.
I've never kissed you.
No one will ever kiss me again but you.
No one.
I'll be your wife and be proud of being your wife.
I'll be good to you and love you truly, always.
White heather for good luck, Miss Catherine.
Come along, Cathy.
What is it?
A cold wind went across my heart just then-- a feeling of doom.
You touched me, and it was gone.
Oh, it's nothing, darling, I'm sure.
Oh, Edgar, I love you. I do.
Good-bye.
And I, too, felt a cold wind across my heart as they rode away together.
But as the years went on, they were really in possession... of a deep and growing happiness.
I wish you could've seen Miss Cathy then.
She became quite the lady of the manor and was almost overfond of Mr. Linton.
For Isabella, she showed great affection... and presided over Thrushcross Grange... with quiet dignity.
It looks as though you've fallen into a trap, Father.
Yes, it does, doesn't it?
There you are.
Checkmate.
- Thank you, Father.
- Well, I'll go and dress for dinner.
What's wrong with the dogs?
Probably a servant coming back from the village.
I talked to Jeff Peters this afternoon about that new wing of ours.
It doesn't look as though we'll marry Isabella off for another decade.
It's a brother's duty to introduce your sister to some other type... than fops and pale young poets.
- You want a dragoon?
- Yes, I do. With a fiery mustache.
Poor Isabella. I'm afraid I got the only prize in the county.
Thank you, darling.
For me, heaven is bounded... by the four walls of this room.
Yes, we're all angels, even my little petit point hero.
I'm just putting wings on him.
Speaking of wings, I'll show you those plans.
- Miss Cathy?
- What is it?
Someone wishes to see you.
- You sound as if it were a ghost.
- It is. He's come back.
Who?
- What does he want?
- He wants to see you.
Tell him-
- Tell him I'm not at home.
Not at home, Cathy? To whom are you not at home?
It's Heathcliff.
Seems he's come back.
Well, that's news. Where has he been?
America, he said. He's so changed I hardly recognized him.
- For the better, I hope.
- Oh, yes. He's quite the gentlemen.
- Fine clothes, a horse.
- Go tell him I don't wish to see him.
Oh, nonsense, Cathy. We can't be as cruel as that.
He's come a long way, and he's a fine gentleman, so Ellen says.
Let's see how America's managed to make a silk purse out of Master Heathcliff.
- Show him in.
- Yes, Master Edgar.
It's chilly.
Why be nervous? The past is dead.
It's nonsense to tremble before a little ghost who returns-- a dead leaf blowing around your feet.
Darling... you may smile at him without fear of offending me.
It's my wife who smiles-- my wife who loves me.
Yes.
I was silly.
Thank you, Edgar.
Well, Heathcliff.
- Mr. Linton.
- How are you?
Hello, Cathy.
- I remember this room.
- Come in. Sit by the fire.
Have a whiskey?
No, thank you.
I've never seen such a change in a man.
I wouldn't have known you.
You seem to have prospered since our last meeting.
Somewhat.
Ellen said you'd been to America.
Yes.
We all wondered where you went.
Have you met my sister, Miss Linton?
What brought about this amazing transformation?
Did you discover a gold mine in the New World... or inherit a fortune?
The truth is, I remembered that my father was an emperor of China... and my mother was an Indian queen... and I went out and claimed my inheritance.
It all turned out just as you once suspected, Cathy... that I had been kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England.
That I was of noble birth.
Are you visiting here long?
I mean, in the village?
The rest of my life.
I've just bought Wuthering Heights-- the house, the stock and the moors.
Hindley has sold you the estate?
He's not aware of it as yet.
I'm afraid it'll be somewhat of a surprise when he finds... his gambling debts and liquor bills paid off by his former stable boy.
Perhaps he will merely laugh at the irony of it.
I don't understand how this could've happened... without Mrs. Linton hearing of it.
Modesty compelled me to play the Good Samaritan in secret.
By heaven. This is the most underhanded piece of work I've ever heard of.
If I'd only known.
I knew Hindley had financial difficulties... but not that his property was being stolen from him by a stranger.
I'm neither thief nor stranger.
Merely your neighbor, sir.
- Now I'll say good night.
- Wait, Heathcliff.
Edgar and I have many neighbors whom we receive with hospitality and friendship.
If you are to be one of them, you're welcome to visit our house... but not with a scowl on your face or an old bitterness in your heart.
Thank you.
It occurs to me that I have not congratulated you on your marriage.
I've often thought of it.
Allow me to express my delight over your happiness now.
Good night.
- I think you behaved abominably.
- What?
You, too, Cathy. I'm dreadfully disappointed in both of you.
- What are you talking about?
- You could have been civil to him.
I conducted myself perfectly, and so did Cathy.
- You dismissed him like a servant.
- And you thought him otherwise?
- I thought him distinguished.
- I hope I misunderstood you.
It's impossible my sister could think of Heathcliff... as anything but a surly, dressed-up beggar, a lout and a boor.
I shall make sure that you never see him again.
Now go to dinner.
Joseph.
Yes, Master Hindley?
- Where's the key?
- Is it in the door?
No, and I want it.
He's left, and it's our chance.
I'll lock him out this time.
If he tries to get in, I'll kill him.
Find that key, and bring me a bottle of wine.
- You've had a bad night.
- A bad night, you call it?
How can I stay sober with that vulture's beak inside me?
He stabbed me in the dark. He robbed me of my home and gold.
- Where's the wine?
- Dr. Kenneth has forbid it.
- Blast Dr. Kenneth!
- Get him what he wants.
Dr. Kenneth has forbid it.
What difference to the world whether he's drunk or sober?
Or to Dr. Kenneth? Do as I tell you.
Get out.
It's too early in the morning to look on the devil.
Your ingratitude makes me almost sad.
All I have done to you is to enable you to be yourself.
My money has helped you drink and gamble and enjoy the world as you wished.
Now that you're without a home I remember that you gave me... a place to sleep when you might've turned me out.
I allow you to remain... and even provide you with solace... against the doctor's orders.
I'll have Wuthering Heights back.
I'll be master here, and I'll turn you out as I should have done years ago.
We're just in time, Joseph.
Mr. Hindley is beginning to whine and stutter.
He needs fire in his veins-- a little courage with which to face his unhappy life.
I'll have my gold, and I'll have your blood, and hell can have your soul!
Laugh now, Heathcliff.
There's no laughter in hell.
All you have to do is to shoot.
They'll thank me for it.
The world will say I did right ridding it of a rotten gypsy beggar!
Yes! They'll say that.
Shoot, and you'll be master here again.
The whole county will resound with your courage.
Go on, shoot, you puling chicken of a man... with not enough blood in you to keep your hand steady!
You remember that time you hit me with a rock?
The times you shamed and flogged me as your stable boy?
You were a coward then, and you're a coward now.
Take him out. Find someplace for him to sleep.
Aye. I'll put him to bed.
Not in the master's room.
I'm master here now.
- His pistol.
- Aye. I'll hide it.
A gentleman must not be deprived of his weapons.
I prefer that he have it by him always as a reminder of his cowardice.
- Master Heathcliff.
- What is it?
- A lady to see you.
- A lady? From where?
The Grange, sir.
The Grange? Why didn't you tell me?
Out of my way.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
Not at all.
I was riding behind the Heights on the moors, and my horse went lame.
- And you brought him here.
- Yes.
That was very wise.
Shall we look at the animal?
That isn't necessary. I've put him in the stables.
He's being taken care of.
I see.
Won't you come in?
Get on with your work.
I was furious with my brother, and Cathy too. I told them so.
I thought they acted most shamefully.
Let me give you a chair.
Your brother didn't send you with these apologies?
Oh, no. He's forbidden me to--
To speak to me?
Yes.
And Mrs. Linton?
She's also very angry with you.
So in all the county you are my only friend.
I would like to be.
Well, let us celebrate our new friendship by a gallop over the moors.
Oh, but my horse is lame.
My dear, your horse is not lame, and it never was.
You came to see me because you are lonely... because it is lonely sitting like an outsider... in so happy a house as your brother's--
lonely riding on the moors with no one at your side.
You won't be lonely anymore.
Good evening, sir.
Good evening, Ellen.
I was afraid you wouldn't come.
Tonight would've been ruined if you hadn't.
Good heavens. Is that Heathcliff?
Yes, it is.
I can't believe it. Cathy having him here--
Not Cathy. It's my sister.
It's just a young girl's fancy, but one must not inflame it... with too much opposition, but let it spend itself harmlessly in a few dances.
Madam Eilers is going to play the harpsichord. Come and sit down.
I shall let you hold my hand underneath my fan.
Thank you very much.
Oh, it's a waltz. Heathcliff, will you?
You see, we can hold each other, and no one can object... because that's the way it's danced.
That's the way gypsies dance.
I'm surprised to see such abandoned ways creep into so fine a house.
Father used to say it'd undermine the whole of society... and turn us into profligates.
- May I have the pleasure?
- Thank you, but I don't think I can.
Nonsense. Let me see you waltz.
- Will you watch me?
- Of course.
I'm ready.
You're not dancing this dance.
Thank you. I'm nearly exhausted.
Will the moonlight and a breath of air refresh you?
Always.
Excuse me, please.
Are you enjoying yourself, Heathcliff?
I've had the pleasure of watching you.
You're very grand, Heathcliff. So handsome.
Looking at you tonight I could not help but remember how things used to be.
They used to be better.
Don't pretend life hasn't improved for you.
Life has ended for me.
How can you stand here beside me and pretend not to remember?
Not to know that my heart is breaking for you?
That your face is the wonderful light burning in all this darkness?
Heathcliff, no. I forbid it.
You forbid what your heart says?
- It's saying nothing.
- I can hear it louder than the music.
Oh, Cathy.
I'm not the Cathy that was. Can't you understand?
I'm somebody else.
I'm another man's wife, and he loves me. And I love him.
If he loved you with all his soul for a lifetime... he couldn't love you as much as I do in a single day.
Not he. Not the world.
Not even you, Cathy, can come between us.
You must go away. You must leave this house and never come back.
I never want to see your face again as long as I live.
You lie.
Why do you think I'm here tonight?
Because you willed it. You willed me here across the sea.
Cathy, have you seen Heathcliff? Oh, there you are.
They're going to play a schottische. Come along.
It's quite suitable to your high moral character.
What's the matter? Has Cathy been behaving horribly again?
If she weren't my sister-in-law, I'd say she was jealous.
Come along.
Come in.
- I want to talk to you.
- What about, Cathy?
- About Heathcliff.
- It's very late.
I have no desire to discuss Heathcliff with you anyway.
- You behaved disgracefully tonight.
- In what way?
It was bad enough your asking him here, but to make a spectacle of yourself.
Catherine, be careful of what you say.
You fool. You vain little fool.
I'll not be silent any longer. I'm going to tell the truth.
- Let me go.
- Not till I open your eyes.
My eyes are quite open, thank you.
Don't you see what he's doing?
He's using you to be near me... to smile at me behind your back... to try to rouse something in my heart that's dead.
I'll not have it. I'll not allow you to help him.
It's you who are vain and insufferable.
- Heathcliff loves me.
- It's a lie.
It's not a lie. He's told me so. He's kissed me.
He's held me in his arms. He's told me that he loves me.
- I'm going to your brother. - Go!
He's asked me to marry him.
We're going to be married.
Heathcliff's going to be my husband.
You can't.
Heathcliff's not a man... but something dark and horrible to live with.
Do you imagine that I don't know why you're acting so?
Because you love him.
Yes! You love him!
And you're mad with pain at the thought of my marrying him.
You want him to pine and dream of you... die for you, while you live in comfort as Mrs. Linton.
You don't want him to be happy.
You want to make him suffer. You want to destroy him!
But I want to make him happy, and I will!
I heard your voices.
We were just discussing the ball.
There's plenty of time for gossip tomorrow.
You ought to come to bed, darling. You look tired.
Good night.
- Good morning, Joseph.
- Mistress Cathy, I mean.
Mr. Hindley's away.
It's Mr. Heathcliff I wish to see.
Oh.
I'll try and find him.
Leave us, Joseph.
What brings you to Wuthering Heights?
Does Edgar know? I doubt he'd approve.
Heathcliff, is it true?
- Is what true?
- That you asked Isabella to marry you.
It is true then. Oh, Heathcliff, you must not do this.
She hasn't harmed you.
- You have.
- Then punish me!
I'm going to, when I take her in my arms-- when I promise her life and happiness.
If there's anything human left in you, don't do this.
Don't make me a partner to such a crime.
It's stupid. It's mad.
If you ever looked at me with what is in you, I'd be your slave.
If your heart were stronger than your fear of God and the world...
I would live silently contented in your shadow.
But no.
You must destroy us both with that weakness you call virtue.
You must keep me tormented with that cruelty you think so pious.
You've been smug and pleased with my vile love of you, haven't you?
After this, you won't think of me as Cathy's foolish and despairing lover.
You'll think of me as Isabella's husband... and be glad for my happiness... as I was for yours.
- Drive to the village. Get Mr. Linton.
- Very well, ma'am.
Marry? It's preposterous. Isabella and Heathcliff?
It's true. What will you do about it?
Do? I'll put her under lock and key if need be.
- We must go after them.
- Going after them is useless.
We must go after them while there's still time.
They mustn't marry.
Don't disturb yourself. There's nothing I can do.
But you must, Edgar. Get your pistols.
Go after them. Kill him!
But stop them from marrying.
This marriage cannot be, do you hear? It must--
And so Heathcliff and Isabella were married.
Many months later at Wuthering Heights... during one of Dr. Kenneth's increasingly rare visits--
Why don't you hit yourself over the head with a hammer... the instant you get up in the morning?
- Why?
- If you hit yourself hard enough... you'll remain unconscious the whole day and achieve the same results... you would from a whole gallon of spirits... with much less wear and tear on the kidneys.
Don't you agree with me, Mrs. Heathcliff?
What does it matter?
Well, I'd hoped that it did matter... that when you came here, things would change.
Only I changed.
I remember this house when it rang with laughter and love. Good-bye.
Ask your husband to call another doctor in future.
Whoever dwells in this house is beyond my healing arts.
I shall miss you, Dr. Kenneth.
I brought you into the world... but it's a world you're not going to grace very long if you stay here.
Dear child, I must tell you this.
Go back where you belong, back with Edgar for a month or two.
It would mean your salvation, and his.
Edgar's disowned me.
Nonsense. That was natural under the circumstances, but he needs you now.
He does. Why?
Cathy is gravely ill.
In fact, it's only a matter of days.
Hours, perhaps.
What is it?
Fever. Inflammation of the lungs.
But there's something beyond that.
I don't know. I'd call it a will to die.
If Cathy died...
I might begin to live.
Begin to live, eh?
In this house with Heathcliff, nothing can live.
Nothing but hate. It's breathing like the devil's own breath on me.
And you, he hates you worse than he does me. He loathes you.
Each time you kiss him his heart breaks with rage because it's not Cathy.
- Kill him.
- I forbade you to speak about him.
- Stop it, you hear me?
- Kill him!
That's the first lucid talk I've heard out of Hindley for weeks.
It's not very Christian talk, but it's coherent.
Seemed to make some points.
- I'm delighted with your improvement.
- I tried to stop him.
Thank you, my dear wife. Your loyalty is touching.
Your curses will come home to feed on your own heart.
Every agony you've given will return.
Why do we have him here?
I can't breathe with him in the house.
Existence would be so much less without my boyhood friend under my roof.
Don't you see?
You poison yourself with hating him.
Darling, please send him away and let love come into the house.
Why isn't there the smell of heather in your hair?
Why won't you let me come near you?
You're not black and horrible as they all think. You're full of pain.
I can make you happy. Let me try.
You won't regret it. I'll be your slave.
I can bring life back to you, new and fresh.
Why are your eyes always empty... like Linton's eyes?
They're not empty.
If you'd only look deeper.
Look at me.
I'm pretty.
I'm a woman, and I love you.
You're all of life to me.
Let me be a single breath of it for you.
Heathcliff, let your heart look at me just once.
Oh, why did God give me life?
What is it but hunger and pain?
What do you want, Ellen?
What are you doing here?
I want to speak to Miss Isabella.
You can do so in front of me.
Her brother has asked me to bring her home for a visit.
He needs you with him, Miss Isabella.
Why?
Let go of me, Heathcliff.
Cathy. She's ill.
Yes.
Mr. Edgar wants you to come home at once, Miss Isabella.
She's dying.
You're not going. She belongs to Edgar if she's dying.
Let her die where she belongs, in Edgar's arms.
Let her die.
Is that better?
Yes.
Isn't there a south wind?
Isn't the snow almost gone?
Quite gone down here, darling. Just a few patches left.
The sky is blue, and the larks are singing... and the brooks are brimming full.
Will you get me something?
- What do you want, darling?
- Some heather.
There's a beautiful patch near the castle.
I want some from there.
Near the castle? What castle, darling?
The castle on the moors, Edgar.
Go there, please.
There's no castle on the moors, darling.
There is.
It's on the hill... beyond Wuthering Heights.
- You mean Penistone Crag.
- Yes.
I was a queen there once.
Go there, Edgar.
Get me some heather, please.
I'll go.
You sleep while I'm gone, and rest so you'll be better tomorrow.
You've been very dear to me, Edgar.
- Very dear.
- Sleep, darling.
Robert!
Get my horse ready. I'm going to Dr. Kenneth. Be quick.
Yes, sir.
Come here.
I was dreaming... you might come before I died.
You might come and scowl at me once more.
Oh, Heathcliff... how strong you look.
How many years do you mean to live after I'm gone?
Don't--
Don't let me go.
If I could only hold you till we were both dead.
Will you forget me when I'm in the earth?
I could as soon forget you as my own life.
Cathy, if you die--
Poor Heathcliff. Come.
Let me feel how strong you are.
Strong enough to bring us both back to life, Cathy, if you want to live.
No, Heathcliff. I want to die.
Oh, Cathy.
Why did you kill yourself?
Hold me.
Just hold me.
No, I'll not comfort you.
My tears don't love you, Cathy.
They blight and curse and damn you.
Heathcliff, don't break my heart.
Oh, Cathy, I never broke your heart. You broke it.
You loved me!
What right to throw love away for the poor fancy thing you felt for him?
For a handful of worldliness?
Misery, death and all the evils God and man could've handed down... would never have parted us.
You did that alone.
You wandered off... like a wanton, greedy child... to break your heart and mine.
Heathcliff, forgive me.
We have so little time.
Oh, Cathy.
Cathy, your wasted hands.
Kiss me again.
Heathcliff, he's coming.
Mr. Linton. For heaven's sake, go! Only be quick!
It's the last time.
I won't go, Cathy. I'm here.
I'll never leave you again.
I told you, Ellen, when he went away, that night in the rain--
I told you I belonged to him, that he was my life, my being.
Don't listen to her ravings.
It's true.
I'm yours, Heathcliff. I've never been anyone else's.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
You can still get out. Go before they get here.
Take me to the window.
Let me look at the moors with you once more.
My darling. Once more.
How beautiful the day is.
Can you see the crag... over there where our castle is?
I'll wait for you... till you come.
Leave her alone.
She's mine.
She's mine now.
Miss Cathy.
Oh, my wild heart.
Miss Cathy.
She's gone.
You've done your last black deed, Heathcliff.
Leave this house.
She's at peace, in heaven and beyond us.
What do they know of heaven or hell, Cathy... who know nothing of life?
Oh, they're praying for you, Cathy.
I'll pray one prayer with them.
I repeat till my tongue stiffens:
Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest so long as I live on.
I killed you.
Haunt me, then. Haunt your murderer.
I know that ghosts have wandered
Be with me always.
Take any form. Drive me mad.
Only do not leave me in this dark alone, where I cannot find you.
I cannot live without my life.
I cannot die without my soul.
Oh, Cathy.
Oh, my dear.
I can still see and hear that wild hour... with poor Heathcliff trying to tear away the veil between death and life... crying out to Cathy's soul... to haunt him and torment him... till he died.
You say that was Cathy's ghost I heard at the window?
Not her ghost... but Cathy's love, stronger than time itself... still sobbing for its unlived days... and uneaten bread.
- What's the matter, man?
- I've gone mad.
- Stark raving mad.
- Dr. Kenneth.
I saw Heathcliff out in the moors in the snow with a woman.
- A woman, you say?
- Yes, a woman.
I saw her with him plain as my own eyes.
It was Cathy.
Go on, man. What happened?
No, I don't know who it was.
I was trying to get up near to them... when suddenly my horse reared and plunged, and I was thrown.
I called out to them, but they didn't hear me, so I followed them.
I tell you I saw them both!
He had his arm about her.
So I climbed up after them... and I found him.
Only him-- alone-- with only his footprints in the snow.
Under a high rock on a ledge near Penistone Crag.
Yes.
Was he dead?
No, not dead, Dr. Kenneth.
Not alone.
He's with her.
They've only just begun to live.
Good-bye, Heathcliff.
Good-bye, my wild, sweet Cathy.
How do you do?
My name is Deems Taylor, and it's my very pleasant duty to welcome you here on behalf of Walt Disney, Leopold Stokowski and all the other artists and musicians whose combined talents went into the creation of this new form of entertainment, Fantasia.
What you're going to see are the designs and pictures and stories that music inspired in the minds and imaginations of a group of artists.
In other words, these are not going to be the interpretations of trained musicians.
Which I think is all to the good.
Now, there are three kinds of music on this Fantasia program.
First is the kind that tells a definite story.
Then there's the kind that, while it has no specific plot, does paint a series of, more or less, definite pictures.
Then there's a third kind, music that exists simply for its own sake.
Now, the number that opens our Fantasia program, the Toccata and Fugue, is music of this third kind, what we call absolute music.
Even the title has no meaning beyond a description of the form of the music.
What you will see on the screen is a picture of the various abstract images that might pass through your mind if you sat in a concert hall listening to this music.
At first you're more or less conscious of the orchestra.
So our picture opens with a series of impressions of the conductor and the players.
Then the music begins to suggest other things to your imagination.
They might be, oh, just masses of color.
Or they may be cloud forms or great landscapes or vague shadows or geometrical objects floating in space.
So now we present the Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach, interpreted in pictures by Walt Disney and his associates, and in music by the Philadelphia Orchestra and its conductor, Leopold Stokowski.
You know, it's funny how wrong an artist can be about his own work.
Now, the one composition of Tchaikovsky's that he really detested was his Nutcracker Suite, which is probably the most popular thing he ever wrote.
It's a series of dances taken out of a full-length ballet called The Nutcracker that he once composed for the St. Petersburg opera house.
It wasn't much of a success and nobody performs it nowadays, but I'm pretty sure you'll recognize the music of the Suite when you hear it.
Incidentally, you won't see any nutcracker on the screen.
There's nothing left of him but the title.
And now we're going to hear a piece of music that tells a very definite story.
As a matter of fact, in this case, the story came first and the composer wrote the music to go with it.
It's a very old story, one that goes back almost 2,000 years.
A legend about a sorcerer who had an apprentice.
He was a bright young lad, very anxious to learn the business.
As a matter of fact, he was a little bit too bright because he started practicing some of the boss's best magic tricks before learning how to control them.
One day, for instance, when he'd been told by his master to carry water to fill a cauldron, he had the brilliant idea of bringing a broomstick to life to carry the water for him.
Well, this worked very well, at first.
Unfortunately, however, having forgotten the magic formula that would make the broomstick stop carrying the water, he found he'd started something he couldn't finish.
Mr. Stokowski. Mr. Stokowski. My congratulations, sir.
Congratulations to you, Mickey.
Gee, thanks.
Well, so long.
I'll be seein' ya.
Goodbye. When Igor Stravinsky wrote his ballet, The Rite of Spring... I repeat, when Igor Stravinsky wrote his ballet, The Rite of Spring, his purpose was, in his own words, to "express primitive life."
And so Walt Disney and his fellow artists have taken him at his word.
Instead of presenting the ballet in its original form, as a simple series of tribal dances, they have visualized it as a pageant, as the story of the growth of life on Earth.
And that story, as you're going to see it, isn't the product of anybody's imagination.
It's a coldly accurate reproduction ofwhat science thinks went on during the first few billion years of this planet's existence.
Science, not art, wrote the scenario of this picture.
According to science, the first living things here were single-celled organisms, tiny little white or green blobs of nothing in particular that lived under the water.
And then, as the ages passed, the oceans began to swarm with all kinds of marine creatures.
Finally, after about a billion years, certain fish, more ambitious than the rest, crawled up on land and became the first amphibians.
And then, several hundred million years ago, nature went off on another tack and produced the dinosaurs.
Now, the name "dinosaur" comes from two Greek words meaning "terrible lizard."
And they certainly were all of that.
They came in all shapes and sizes, from little, crawling horrors about the size of a chicken to hundred-ton nightmares.
They were not very bright.
Even the biggest of them had only the brain of a pigeon.
They lived in the air and water as well as on land.
As a rule, they were vegetarians, rather amiable and easy to get along with.
However, there were bullies and gangsters among them.
The worst of the lot, a brute named tyrannosaurus rex, was probably the meanest killer that ever roamed the Earth.
The dinosaurs were lords of creation for about 200 million years.
And then... Well, we don't exactly know what happened.
Some scientists think that great droughts and earthquakes turned the whole world into a gigantic dustbowl.
In any case, the dinosaurs were wiped out.
That is where our story ends.
Where it begins is at a time infinitely far back, when there was no life at all on Earth.
Nothing but clouds of steam, boiling seas and exploding volcanoes.
So now, imagine yourselves out in space billions and billions of years ago, looking down on this lonely, tormented little planet, spinning through an empty sea of nothingness.
And now we'll have a 15-minute intermission. Before we get into the second half of the program,
I'd like to introduce somebody to you, somebody who's very important to Fantasia.
He's very shy and very retiring.
I just happened to run across him one day at the Disney studios.
But when I did, I suddenly realized that here was not only an indispensable member of the organization, but a screen personality whose possibilities nobody around the place had ever noticed.
And so I'm very happy to have this opportunity to introduce to you the soundtrack.
All right. Come on. That's all right.
Atta soundtrack.
Now, watching him, I discovered that every beautiful sound also creates an equally beautiful picture.
Now, look.
Will the soundtrack kindly produce a sound?
Go on, don't be nervous. Go ahead. Any sound.
Suppose we hear and see the harp.
Now one of the strings, say, the violin.
And now... now, one of the woodwinds, a flute.
Very pretty.
Now, let's have a brass instrument, the trumpet.
All right.
Now, how about a low instrument, the bassoon?
Go on. Go on. Drop the other shoe, will you?
Well, now to finish, suppose we see some of the percussion instruments, beginning with the bass drum.
Thanks a lot, old man.
The symphony that Beethoven called the Pastoral, his sixth, is one of the few pieces of music he ever wrote that tells something like a definite story.
He was a great nature lover, and in this symphony, he paints a musical picture of a day in the country.
Now, of course, the country that Beethoven described was the countryside with which he was familiar.
But his music covers a much wider field than that, so Walt Disney has given the Pastoral Symphony a mythological setting.
And that setting is of Mt.
Olympus, the abode of the gods.
And here, first of all, we meet a group of fabulous creatures of the field and forest, unicorns, fauns, Pegasus, the flying horse, and his entire family, the centaurs, those strange creatures that are half-man and half-horse.
And their girlfriends, the centaur-ettes.
Later on, we meet our old friend, Bacchus, the god ofwine, presiding over a bacchanal.
The party is interrupted by a storm.
And now, we see Vulcan forging thunderbolts and handing them over to the king of all the gods, Zeus, who plays darts with them.
As the storm clears, we see Iris, the goddess of the rainbow.
And Apollo, driving his sun chariot across the sky.
And then Morpheus, the god of sleep, covers everything with his cloak of night, as Diana, using the new moon as a bow, shoots an arrow of fire that spangles the sky with stars.
Now we're going to do one of the most famous and popular ballets ever written,
The Dance of the Hours from Ponchielli's opera La Gioconda.
It's a pageant of the hours of the day.
We see first a group of dancers in costumes to suggest the delicate light of dawn.
Then a second group enters dressed to represent the brilliant light of noon day.
As these withdraw, a third group enters in costumes that suggest the delicate tones of early evening.
Then a last group, all in black, the somber hours of the night.
Suddenly, the orchestra bursts into a brilliant finale in which the hours of darkness are overcome by the hours of light.
All this takes place in the great hall with its garden beyond, of the palace of Duke Alvise, a Venetian nobleman.
The last number on our Fantasia program is a combination of two pieces of music so utterly different in construction and mood that they set each other off perfectly.
The firstis A Night on Bald Mountain, by one of Russia's greatest composers, Modest Mussorgsky.
The second is Franz Schubert's world-famous Ave Maria.
Musically and dramatically, we have here a picture of the struggle between the profane and the sacred.
Bald Mountain, according to tradition, is the gathering place of Satan and his followers.
Here on Walpurgis Night, which is the equivalent of our own Halloween, the creatures of evil gather to worship their master.
Under his spell, they dance furiously until the coming of dawn and the sounds of church bells send the infernal army slinking back into their abodes of darkness.
And then we hear the Ave Maria, with its message of the triumph of hope and life over the powers of despair and death.
- What's new? - Same old daily bunkeroo.
Mr. Powers says he wants to see that foreign stuff as soon as it comes in.
Don't declare war for a few minutes.
"According to a high official, it is believed..."
Bah!
Foreign correspondent!
I could get more news out of Europe looking in a crystal ball.
That, uh, Stebbins cable has a morsel in it.
Stebbins makes me sick. They all make me sick.
Europe about to blow up, and all I can get out of my foreign staff... is a daily guessing game.
- I want some facts, Mr. Bradley! - For instance?
Any kind of facts.
There must be something going on in Europe beside a nervous breakdown. Why not try sending me over, Mr. Powers?
You've written a book on economics or something...
The Twilight of Feudalism. Yes.
It was very well received. I don't want any more economists... sages or oracles bombinating over our cables. Not by me.
I want a reporter, somebody who doesn't know the difference... between an "ism" and a kangaroo.
A good, honest crime reporter... that's what the Globe needs.
That's what Europe needs.
There's a crime hatching on that bedeviled continent.
Wait a minute.
I've got something that might pass for an idea.
Who was that fellow that ran down the payroll robbery last week?
Oh, you mean Johnny Jones.
He beat up a policeman, didn't he, in the line of duty?
Yes, there's talk at the City desk of firing him. Hmm.
Beat up a policeman, eh?
Sounds ideal for Europe. Send Mr. Jones up here right away.
Mr. Powers wants to see you, Mr. Jones.
- He does, huh?
- You should come right away.
- What about?
- I ain't in his confidence.
Tell him to save his breath. Tell him I've resigned.
- I'm supposed to bring you there.
- Okay.
Wait till I open this.
Where's Mr. Jones?
I told you to send him right up here!
- Are you Mr. Jones? - Yes.
Sit down, please.
You mind a personal question? - No.
- Are you married?
- No luck.
- Single, eh? - Ever been in Europe?
- No.
What's your opinion of the present European crisis, Mr. Jones? What crisis?
I'm referring to the impending war.
Oh, that.
To tell you the truth, Mr. Powers, I haven't given it much thought.
You don't keep up with our foreign news, do you?
Mr. Powers, if you're gonna fire me, you can scrap the intelligence test. It's okay with me.
I can get a job on any other newspaper in town. - So long. - Wait a minute.
- Nobody fired you.
- Huh?
How would you like to cover the biggest story in the world today?
Give me an expense account, and I'll cover anything.
I'll give you an expense account.
- Okay, what's the story? - Europe.
I'm not exactly equipped, but I could do some reading up.
No, I like you just as you are.
What Europe needs is a fresh, unused mind. - Foreign correspondent, huh?
- No.
Reporter.
I don't want correspondence. I want news.
Think you could dig up some news in Europe? - I'd be very happy to try, sir.
- This is what I mean.
Mr. Van Meer, when questioned by our oracle, Mr. Stebbins... refused to open his mouth.
Twelve hundred words cable-tolled to the fact that... the great Van Meer had nothing to say.
You know what that stuff is doing?
Driving our readers crazy with frustration. Who's Van Meer?
Keynote to the European situation today.
If Van Meer stays at the helm... of his country's affairs for the next three months... it may mean peace in Europe.
If we knew what he was thinking, we'd know where Europe stands.
- A German, huh? - No.
Holland's strongman. One of two signers of the Dutch treaty with the Belgians.
Now, this is your first assignment.
Talk with him, find out what's in that treaty... and what he thinks is going to happen... facts.
- Van Meer, huh? - Right.
- Anybody else?
How about Hitler?
Don't you think it'd be good to pump him?
He must have something on his mind.
Yes?
Mr. Stephen Fisher to see you, Mr. Powers.
Tell him to come in.
Did you ever hear of Stephen Fisher?
- I'm afraid he's not on my beat.
- He is from now on.
He's head of the Universal Peace Party, and very close to Van Meer.
They're both working to prevent Europe going up in flames.
Oh.
- How do you do, Mr. Fisher? - How are you? - Nice of you to come over.
Mr. Fisher, Mr. Jones, our new foreign correspondent.
- I want you to know each other.
- How do you do?
"Jones"...
I don't like that name. It's going to handicap you, young man.
Now, wait a minute.
I've got some sort of a name here.
Yes. "Haverstock." "Huntley Haverstock."
- Sounds more important, don't you think?
Very dashing too. It sounds better than Richard Harding Davis.
What's the matter with that?
We can't use that.
That's the name of one of our greatest war correspondents 40 years ago.
Speak up, young man. You don't mind being Huntley Haverstock, do you? A rose by any name, sir.
It's exciting being present at the christening of an American newspaper correspondent.
Shouldn't we break a bottle of champagne over him?
Break one over my head to see if I'm still awake. "Huntley Haverstock."
Well, Mr. Haverstock, you'd better get started. You've got a lot to do...
passports, photos, visas... - Expenses.
- I'll send a note to the cashier.
I hope you brought your Sunday articles over.
I managed three of them.
- See you in London, Mr. Haverstock.
- Yes, of course.
Thank you, Mr. Powers. Thank you for everything.
Except Huntley Haverstock.
Get a load of this, Mother.
How's it look? Chic?
Don't wear it over one eye.
It makes you look like a gangster.
You always think boys are wearing their hats over one eye. Let him wear it the way it is.
He'll have to wear a stovepipe when he gets to London. They call 'em poppers. Toppers, Uncle Bjorn.
Bobby, put that in the box for Uncle John.
- Let me try it on.
- No, I'm going to first.
- Now he's a regular war correspondent. - Without a war.
He'll get his war, all right.
Aw, they're all throwing a big bluff over there.
Let's hope so.
Mother, how do you like the way we have our nest furnished?
I'd hang lighter curtains, and I'd move that sofa out in the middle.
It's too bad you haven't an open fireplace.
If you'd speak to the captain, he'd tend to everything.
All ashore that's going ashore!
Now, Mother.
You're Jones, aren't you? My name's Stebbins, London man for the Globe.
Yes, Mr. Powers told me you'd be here. Nice of you to come.
- I lost mine on the way over.
- I can say your other name too... that Huntley Tavers... feld...
I could say it yesterday, but I had a tough session with the boys last night.
- I'll stick to Jones, if you don't mind.
- Jones is great with me. Let's get out of here.
This crowd's making me nervous. My nerves aren't in the pink this morning.
You take it easy.
I'll follow you.
Porter, bring those bags, and don't bang them into my knees. Very good, sir.
What about a drink after that long train ride?
Sounds like a very logical idea.
I may not act it, but I've been here 25 years...
London man for the Globe, and they haven't caught on to me yet.
How did you manage it?
You cable back the government handouts... and sign 'em "our London correspondent."
- What's yours?
- Scotch and soda, please. - Miss?
Oh, miss? - Just a moment, sir.
Oh, miss, please...
Scotch and soda and a glass of milk.
- "A glass of milk"?
- I'm on the wagon.
I went to the doctor today about these jitters... and he said it was the wagon for a month or a new set of organs.
I can't afford new organs.
If I'd known you were on the wagon, I could've got along without this... but as long as it's here...
Good luck.
- Just like any other scotch and soda.
That's what I thought.
Doesn't taste the way it did when I was a baby.
That's got poison in it. Speaking of poison, I got some pills...
Oh, some cables have been coming over from New York.
They love to cable.
Makes them think you're working for them.
There's an invitation to that lunch for the Dutchman Van Meer tomorrow. I guess that's your dish.
This is given by the Universal Peace Party.
That's Fisher's organization, isn't it? I don't know.
I don't follow those things very much.
New York wants it, I send it.
That's the secret of being a correspondent.
Been doing it 25 years.
Twenty-five years, and I end up on milk.
- Good morning. How's the water wagon? - Look at that.
One of them shook off this morning.
Oh... well, I'm just on my way to the Van Meer luncheon.
I've got to have lunch here with old man Clark. He's the international...
Here you are.
I didn't know whether to meet you in the grill or upstairs. Hmm. Good-bye, Stebbins.
Good-bye, Miss, uh, Clark.
Who is he calling "Clark"? He's got his nerve.
Oh, some fresh American reporter.
Good morning, Mr. Van Meer. I beg your pardon, sir.
You are Mr. Van Meer, aren't you?
That's my name, yes.
My name's Haverstock. You don't know me. I'm an American.
I happened to be on my way to your luncheon.
Ah? - Then perhaps...
- That's very kind of you, sir... Come.
Come, come. It's all in a good cause.
Savoy Hotel.
- This is very kind of you, Mr. Van Meer.
- It's a pleasure, my boy.
I dislike riding alone. One thinks too much while riding alone.
The Polish situation... and the Dutch treaty with the Belgians must be on your mind these days.
What do you feel England will do in case the Nazis... England is so beautiful, hmm?
It's nice to see London in the sunshine.
Always there is lots of rain or fog.
Yes, I found out it was August. That was good for me.
But would you mind telling me how you feel... about Mr. Fisher and his peace organization?
You know Mr. Fisher?
Oh, a very fine man.
A good man. I wish there were more like him in the world just now.
Then I take it you don't think there's much hope for peace.
I mean, you don't think one little peace organization... can make much headway against the European war panic.
I would like to think so. Oh, look at those birds.
No matter how big the city, there must always be parks... and places for the birds to live.
I was walking through the park this morning... and I saw several people feeding the birds.
That's a good sign at a time like this, is it not?
Yes, it's a dandy sign... but I think right now the birds are the least of our problems.
Your country, for instance... what might be its attitude...
Oh, we're now near the Savoy.
How much?
By the way, young man... what newspaper do you represent?
As a matter of fact, I'm not exactly a reporter... but I was trying to get you to talk, and I didn't want bird talk either.
I gathered that.
Just what was it you were trying to get me to tell you?
I was trying to find out what you know about the possibility of a general war.
How do you really feel about it?
Well, I did have one.
The last news from Poland was very alarming.
- Nobody wants war, and yet...
- Then we don't have to have it.
Miss Fisher, often circumstances over which we have no control...
Yes, those very convenient circumstances over which we have no control. It always seems odd, but they usually bring on war.
You never hear of circumstances over which we have no control... rushing us into peace, do you?
Very determined woman, my daughter.
Let's go and see if you can pick a fight somewhere else. Excuse us.
- Good for you.
- Wasn't he a bore?
Many worthy people are. How do you do?
How would you like to be fishing in Ireland at this minute?
We haven't had a good sail or swim together in months.
Not even a game of cribbage. Miss them?
Up anchor, mate. There's the admiral.
He has a weakness for you. Go do your stuff.
Ah, here you are... the Jones that became a Haverstock.
Have a good trip?
I still wish you were Richard Harding Davis.
- So do I, sir. Anything except...
- Hello.
Hello. Meet Mrs. Appleby.
This is Huntley Haverstock... special correspondent, New York Globe.
- Foreign correspondent?
Not really? - Cross my heart. You look such a sweet boy.
You don't seem like the others... you know, greasy.
- No?
- But I'm sure you're marvelous at it.
I wonder if you know a friend, Monty Rockingham.
He's in the embassy at Istanbul. Or is it Honolulu?
Do help me with this distinguished-looking gentleman over here.
I can't make any headway with him, but I'm sure he must speak some language. Everybody does.
I haven't the least idea who he is... but there isn't anybody here who isn't internationally important.
This is Mr. Haver- Uh, Stock.
No English?
Vous parlez francais?
- Try German.
- Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
Splendid.
What else do you know? - Well, only pig latin.
- Pig la- Oh.
Here we are. This'll do it.
Ah.
Now we're getting somewhere.
The universal language. Dear Maharaja.
Well, they come in pairs.
If you speak English, will you give me a hand with the laughing Latvian?
What's he talking?
Latvian.
No kidding?
I didn't know the Lats had a language.
I thought they just rubbed noses.
You mean, you actually speak Latvian?
Oh, just enough to get about.
What does "just enough to get about" consist of in Latvia?
Well, I don't think you'd have any trouble.
That'll be a comfort when I get to Latvia.
You think there might be a chance soon?
You never can tell in my racket.
I suppose you've guessed I'm a foreign correspondent. Are you? That's nice.
I see you're taking notes. Are you covering this affair too? - I sort of work here.
- Oh, publicity!
You're just the one I'm looking for.
We've got to go in a secret conference right away. Oh.
Me? Excuse me.
I beg your pardon, but I have a Latvian friend here... who's particularly interested in the origin of the kilt.
I wonder if you'd be interested in talking to him. He's a lovely fellow.
You see... the Greeks, in the early period, they used to wear a kilt. What is this big secret conference all about?
It's no secret as far as I'm concerned. However, I'll let you in on that part later.
But since you're handling the publicity for this outfit... you might give me a line on what it's about... this League for Peace and Understanding.
What is it you'd like to know?
First, is this Mr. Fisher entirely on the level? - Very much so.
- He seems like a very nice guy.
He is, I assure you.
Well, what is it that makes him, or you, think... that an organization like this, made up of well-meaning amateurs... buck up against those tough military boys of Europe?
It's the "well-meaning amateurs," as you call them... who do the fighting when the war comes, isn't it?
- Please don't go yet. You don't want any of those dreary chicken patties.
I must go. Then sit at the press table with me.
Nobody listens to the speeches at the press table. We could talk.
- You don't know my name yet. - Is it necessary?
It is to me.
Don't mind if you hear... it's Huntley Haverstock, because it's really Jones.
- Mine's really Smith. Don't mind if you hear it's anything else.
- Waiter?
- Yes, sir? Same young lady.
Try again.
I have taken the young lady 13 notes, sir.
She won't accept any more.
Milords, ladies... and gentlemen... pray silence for your chairman...
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make... which I'm sure will be a great disappointment to us all.
I've just received this telegram from Mr. Van Meer... who was to have been our guest of honor today.
"Deeply regret. Called away suddenly owing to unforeseen circumstances.
I am with you and your work with all my heart. I could not have said more had I been there."
Although this removes one of our star attractions at the luncheon... we may have more time to tell you... from the inside what this party has stood for... and why we've asked you here today.
I can think of no one more competent to do this... than the speaker I am about to introduce.
I trust you will not think this is a family affair... when I say I refer to my daughter...
Miss Carol Fisher.
Milords... ladies and gentlemen... pray silence for Miss Carol Fisher.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I trust that, even making allowances for a father's exuberance... you do not think I'm in any way being put forward today... as a substitute for Mr. Van Meer.
Unhappily for us, no one can take Mr. Van Meer's place.
What I can do, possibly, is to clear up a few misapprehensions... that seem to have crept into the public discussion of this movement... and revise some of the epithets applied to us... by some who have not gone as deeply into the matter as they might.
The female of the "speeches" is deadlier than the male.
...as a group of well-meaning amateurs. I'm sure there are some of you here who think of us as such.
I should like to ask anyone who has called us "well-meaning amateurs"... to stand up by his chair and tell me just why... a well-meaning amateur is any less reliable... than a well-meaning professional at a moment like this... but I'll not take the time.
I think the world has been run long enough by the well-meaning professional.
We might give the amateurs their chance now.
But what I really want to do is give you a brief idea of... just... just how far-reaching our amateur plans are.
Use your notes.
And, uh, just... why we ask for your support... professional or amateur.
What I mean is that... however much one may...
I mean, we should both... both of us...
Better to wait in there. - Mr. Fisher, how are you?
- When did you get over?
Just now. I had a cable from Mr. Powers.
This is my first assignment.
Rather ironic assignment: a peace conference in the shadow of war.
You mean it's really coming?
Today and tomorrow will tell. There's still hope. - I'm going back to London today.
- Leaving for London? I only just got here. The conference is just beginning.
Today and tomorrow, the work of peace must be done in London rather than Amsterdam.
Are you taking your whole staff to London with you, including your...
No, someone staying here will see you're given all the help you need.
You'll be in very good hands. Here she is. - Mrs. Appleby, Mr. Haverstock.
- We met at the luncheon.
You remember Mr. , don't you?
He's nice, but I still can't understand him.
Dr. Williamson, Mr. Huntley Haverstock represents the New York Globe.
He's unfamiliar with Amsterdam and the machinery of peace meetings.
Would you take him under your wing?
Perhaps you and Mrs. Appleby might see he samples eight or ten varieties of Dutch cheese tonight.
Now I must see what unlucky person... is going to give up his seat to me on that plane.
Don't get into any mischief, will you?
- "Mischief"? - Your first visit to Amsterdam?
Yes.
You must let me take you to Rembrandt's house...
It might be a good idea if we went over the agenda of the conference.
If you'll excuse me, I see a friend.
Mr. Van Meer, how are you?
We seemed to lose each other the day before yesterday.
I'm so sorry you were called away.
Don't you remember me?
We shared the same cab on the way to the luncheon.
Excuse me.
May I have your picture, Mr. Van Meer?
Thank you.
There he goes!
Follow that car! Quick!
- You better get out of here. - Don't be silly.
Drive on. - Who's he shot?
- Van Meer.
Assassinated.
- Dead?
- Looked like it. Bad show.
Couldn't be much worse, from his point of view.
Do you mind shoving your knees out of the way?
You'd better hop in the back, old girl. Hurry.
Safety glass.
I wonder whose make.
- Good chauffeur you've got, Miss Fisher.
- Yes, isn't he? - You two know each other?
- Yeah. I forgot. This is Scott ffolliott.
Newspaperman, same as you.
Roaming correspondent. - Mr. Haverstock, Mr. ffolliott.
- With a double F. - How do you do?
- How do you do?
- I don't get the double F.
- At the beginning. Both small Fs.
It can't be at the beginning.
One of my ancestors had his head chopped off by Henry VIII.
His wife dropped the capital letter to commemorate the occasion.
There it is.
- How do you say it?
Like a stutter? - No, just straight "fuh."
It's stopped raining. The sun's coming out. The police are coming.
That's the most amazing disappearing trick I've ever seen.
Don't suppose they could've got up that high, do you?
Vanished.
Take a look for yourself, old boy.
Tell him your name, about the two small Fs.
That would be a bit over his head.
Well, this isn't catching any assassins.
We should've kept one of those policemen and played bridge.
I guess you're right.
I'll bet 2 to 1 on the derby.
Look at those sails on that windmill.
You'll get used to those when you've been in Holland longer.
I could've sworn they were going against the wind.
Why don't you lie down on the grass and cool off?
In due time, but first I want you to get the police back here.
The police again? We don't want the police.
I've decided not to prosecute.
You'll get the police, 'cause our man's in there. - Where? - In that mill.
- What makes you think so?
- A lot can happen while I'm explaining. Please get the police.
I'd go if I spoke the language.
- What'll you do?
- A bit of snooping.
I hate to seem executive, but this is serious.
- Come on, Scott.
- All right. You shall have your police.
it's a signal. It's a signal for that plane to land.
Ah, come in... and close the door, mister.
Mr. Van Meer.
It isn't possible.
I've just been given a drug... drug of some sort.
But I saw you shot just now outside the conference hall!
I saw it!
They gave it to me... when they moved me from...
The man I saw shot was a dead image!
The man you saw shot... that wasn't me.
He was a subs- substitute that looked like me.
But why? What...
They...
They want the world to think... that I've been assassinated. Yes.
To conceal the fact... that I am in their hands.
"Their hands"? Who are "they"?
I can't explain.
I'm not cert- This drug... I can hardly think.
All I can tell you is that... they are going to take me away by plane... like a bird.
Always are places in the city... where birds can get crumbs.
Birds.
Cru-
Oh, quickly.
A pencil.
You see?
Old mill.
Up the road.
Look.
Old mill. Understand?
Does anyone here speak English?
English? We speak English in the school.
Tell these two policemen... to come with me. Why have you been holding out on me?
Very, very important.
Big old prisoner. Old mill.
Tell them to follow me. Do you understand?
Yeah. That's what I've been trying to tell you. Come on.
They've gone.
They've killed him.
But if isn't...
Who are you?
Where are the others?
There's been a frame-up. Ask him where the others have gone.
He says he doesn't know what you're talking about. There are no other people.
He's been asleep here all day.
He's lying.
I talked to Van Meer in this very room.
Well, there's one thing I can show you... the assassin's car, the one we followed.
A unique specimen, old boy. The only one-horse sports car in the world.
That car was here!
Listen, I know I look a fool... but there's something fishy going on around here.
There's a big story in this.
I can smell it... and I'm going to get to the bottom of it.
Don't tell me you're here to apologize about the windmill.
No, sir.
We simply want you to come with us... and tell your story to our chief of police.
Does this chief of police speak English?
I'm a very busy man.
It will take no more than half an hour, sir. We all speak English.
That's marvelous. That's more than I can say for my country.
Would you sit down? I have to make a phone call.
Dinner date with a young lady.
The exchange doesn't answer. Well, I'll call later. Look, I'm a very quick bather.
Would you excuse me... while I jump in the tub and give myself a shave?
Look at some magazines. I'll be right back.
You couldn't bring the chief of police here, could you?
No, I am afraid not.
No, I thought not.
- Please don't bother to come.
- You'll find it on my dressing table.
Well, we meet again.
So it seems.
Quite a lot's happened since I last saw you. - So I see.
- Uh...
I, uh, had quite a chase after that guy outside Amsterdam. It's quite a country.
It's interesting. Windmills and tulips. Did you find everything you...
We were just talking about the tulips.
Don't seem to be any.
I really think I should be going now. Thank you very much for the powder.
Oh, must you really go now?
Yes, I must be going now.
Good-bye.
You've made quite a day of it, haven't you? Shh!
Listen... Made monkeys out of ffolliott and me, broken into my bedroom... and disgraced me before a friend of my father's.
What are your plans now?
You might at least have had your clothes on. Take it easy.
This is serious business.
I've seen your "serious business" before.
- What are you doing?
- Escaping. From what?
A couple fellows in my room about to kill me.
May I ask who?
Two gentlemen disguised as policemen waiting to take me for a ride.
Don't you think you've been talking through your hat long enough?
I'm not! I've thrown a monkey wrench into some international dirty business.
I know Van Meer's alive. That's the reason they want to kill me.
- I can think of others.
- You've got to help me... not for my sake, but this is the biggest story in Europe.
Your childish mind is as out of place in Europe as you are in my bedroom.
Get over there.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
This is going straight back to London. We'll be common gossip by tomorrow.
I don't care for myself, but my father's engaged in great work. He's trying to help avert a dreadful war.
This is just the thing to discredit him.
I know you care nothing about our work.
All you're interested in... is having fun with windmills and hotel bathrooms.
You don't believe I'm in trouble.
You'll be in plenty of trouble if you don't get out. For the last time, please go.
Okay, but I want you to know exactly what's going to happen when I do go.
I'll go back to my room and try to shake those fellows off, but I won't succeed.
They'll stick to me like a couple of tattoo marks until they get me.
They'll stop at nothing.
I seem to know too much, and they're right.
I don't know the ins and outs of your crackpot movement... and what's wrong with Europe, but I do know a story... and I'll keep after it until either I get it or it gets me.
Sorry you have those derogatory opinions of me... but I guess that can't be helped.
Well, so long.
It's been nice knowing you.
I said "good-bye."
Don't go.
Oh, I guess I could've handled those fellows all right, with luck.
We mustn't take chances. We should get some help.
That's what I had in mind at first.
I'll get Dr. Williamson and Mr. Van... Not with me this way.
They might not understand.
They have understood.
We could catch the boat to England and see Father if you could get out.
That's the hitch. What's that friend of yours? f-f something.
- ffolliott.
- Give me Mr. ffolliott's room, please.
Left the hotel?
That's strange. We were to dine together tonight.
He realized how much I meant to you.
You'd mean much more with your clothes on. You like the intellectual type.
Say, I've got an idea. What?
The manager, please.
Buzz for the valet, will you?
Hello, is this the manager?
This is Mr. Haverstock in 537. What kind of a hotel is this?
My bathtub leaks... my phone's out of order, and I've been robbed.
Will you send somebody up right away?
Thank you.
Operator, send a waiter up to 537.
And ask the chambermaid to bring up clean sheets. I've set mine on fire.
And I'd like a window-cleaner, and ask boots to come up and get my shoes.
And hurry it up.
That's a good girl.
That'll clutter up that room for those two guys.
It's the valet. Come in. - Do you speak English?
- Go to my room, 537...
- 537. And get me a shirt, tie, suit, and a hat.
You see, my husband's waiting in the room for this gentleman.
No sign of them yet. Come on, let's hide in the cabin.
- Full up, sir. Sorry. - Not even a small cabin?
Not a thing.
Everybody in a hurry to get home. I see.
I have a rare bank note here you might be interested in.
That is, if you collect rare bank notes.
Sir, I'd do it if I could, but there just isn't a place left.
Aboard an English ship you come up against such an air of incorruptibility.
As a matter of fact, sir, I just had a cabin returned.
- Can I have your name, sir? - Oh.
One cabin isn't going to do us much good. We just can't...
I fully intended to sleep in the lounge. I hope you didn't think I...
No, of course not. It's very kind of you. Fine.
I'll take it. I'm sorry, sir.
I'm afraid it's too late now.
You seemed to have some doubt about taking it. I had to let that gentleman have it.
It's such a rare five-pound note too. The watermark's upside down.
I think you'd have loved it.
Well, perhaps next time.
Were you really going to tip that man five pounds?
Of course. I charge all my traveling expenses to the office.
Corrupting an official: five pounds.
You're just a wee bit unscrupulous, aren't you?
Not unscrupulous. Just in love.
- It's the same thing, I suppose.
- I beg your pardon?
I beg yours. You see, I love you and I want to marry you.
I love you, and I want to marry you.
Well, that cuts our love scene down quite a bit, doesn't it?
- Do you mind?
- Not at all. It's made a new man of me.
I hope not entirely new. It took me some time... to get used to the first man you were.
To be perfectly frank, I expected a little more argument.
I'm left with quite a few things I wanted to say.
Save them until after we're married. I imagine they'll sound much better then.
I'd saved things to say then too.
You were really quite sure of yourself, weren't you? Funny...
I didn't think I had a chance. A guy's got a right to dream, though, hasn't he? Evidently.
Do you think your father will understand?
I think Father will be delighted, frankly.
- Good morning, Miss Carol.
- Good morning, Stiles.
- This is Mr. Haverstock.
Is Father up yet? - Yes, miss. He's having breakfast.
Come on.
- Hello, Father.
- What are you doing in London? Jo...
Mr. Haverstock brought me back on the boat. Nothing wrong, is there?
You're not ill?
You look healthy.
No, I'm fine. It's Mr. Haverstock.
I hope you don't mind my barging in.
On the contrary. I'm delighted. You cover a lot of territory, don't you?
You didn't even send a wire. Just for that, I hope your trip was perfectly uncomfortable.
It wasn't so bad. We couldn't get cabins... but we managed to sleep on the deck.
Monsieur Krug. How nice to see you again.
Mr. Haverstock, Monsieur Krug.
Monsieur Krug is a member of the Borovian Embassy staff here.
Sit down. Have a spot of breakfast.
I know I should tidy up, but I'm simply starved.
So you were in Amsterdam yesterday, Mr. Haverstock? Poor Van Meer.
I count his death a heavy personal loss.
Of all people, why Van Meer?
You can't ask "why" of an assassin.
There's no logic in killing. We can't spare such men in a world like ours.
Did you by any chance meet him, Mr. Haverstock?
Not formally, but I saw him die.
Horrible.
As a matter of fact, I chased the man that shot him and almost caught him.
Mr. Haverstock is a newspaperman, Monsieur Krug.
That would be quite a coup, bringing in your first story wrapped around an assassin.
I shall have to be getting along now, Mr. Fisher.
Shall we settle on the wording for the peace petition now or later?
We may as well clear it up in the study.
You'll excuse us?
Father, could I speak to you?
Meanwhile, see if you can't interest Mr. Haverstock... in some eggs and bacon. It's terribly important. This won't take a moment.
Mr. Fisher...
What's that man doing here? It's Monsieur Krug.
- Van Meer isn't dead.
- But I just read...
That was his double. Van Meer was kidnapped.
I talked to him in a mill outside Amsterdam.
What has Krug to do with it?
Remember my description of the man in the mill?
You mean the sweater? Of course!
But that's impossible. We've known Monsieur Krug...
Mr. Krug brought Van Meer here by plane last night. He's in England. They're hiding him.
Positive about this?
I was as close to Krug as I am to you now.
It'd be terrible if we made a mistake. On the other hand...
Mr. Fisher.
Leave it to me.
I don't want to seem inhospitable, but I must ask you to leave.
Mr. Haverstock is going to suggest I turn you over to the police.
Mr. Haverstock seems to be something of a troublemaker.
I thought you said he'd been taken care of by our agents in Amsterdam.
I thought so too. I don't understand if, unless perhaps...
Miss Fisher's being with him may have caused complications.
It would've been ideal if she'd been in our confidence.
Leave my daughter out of it.
- I beg your pardon.
- Most unfortunate, his coming here.
Someone has to take care of the sordid details.
But this is close to home. In fact, it is my home.
After all, I'm only a politician. In a sense.
And politicians aren't usually called upon to, uh... do away with their guests, are they?
Quiet, boy. Quiet.
Not in the house. No, sir.
But I have an idea.
- Do you remember Rowley?
- Rowley?
Yes, the little man who used to work at your father's stables in Austria.
Yes, I recall he was present when a mutual friend of ours, um... accidentally fell off the high bridge at Bern.
If Mr. Haverstock could be induced to hire him... in the capacity of a private detective...
- What for?
- Well... you should warn him that it is very dangerous to go about London... with the knowledge that he has.
Yes, I see. Yes.
You use the English language with great delicacy, Krug. Thank you, sir.
I shall look Mr. Rowley up at once... and give him his instructions.
But you mustn't. It would be too dangerous.
What do we do?
Call Scotland Yard?
I thought it best to send Krug on his way.
You let him get away?
Well, listen... Don't you see how important it is not to rouse Krug's suspicions?
- Van Meer will be killed immediately.
- Dead or alive, it's a story. Johnny, Father's right.
- Okay, I'll cable them what I've got.
- I wouldn't if I were you. Van Meer's life may depend upon our keeping this quiet.
Keep it quiet?
A famous diplomat's kidnapped under my own eyes, and I muzzle myself?
I'm sorry, but this is a story with facts... the kind I was sent here to get, the kind America's waiting for.
It'll be bigger if you can wait just a few hours... until we can find Van Meer and discover what's behind this whole curious business.
- I know what's behind it.
- I don't mean who's behind it. I mean the why of it.
Dear, will you get me all my correspondence with Krug?
Please, Johnny, do what Father says.
It'll be best for you and poor Mr. Van Meer.
Okay. I'll wait.
I'm worried about you.
I'm a little worried about myself. I feel weak-minded.
You're doing the right thing, but I don't like you dashing about without protection.
Forget it.
If what you say is true, you need protection.
I've covered beer mob killings and race riots since I was a tot without even a rabbit's foot.
These people are criminals, more dangerous than your rumrunners and housebreakers.
They're fanatics.
They combine a mad love of country with an equally mad indifference to life... their own as well as others.
And I really couldn't face Mr. Powers again... if you didn't live long enough to turn in the best story of the year.
I'm gonna be a fine foreign correspondent hiding in an attic somewhere.
I'm not suggesting you hide anywhere. Just get somebody to watch out for you. A nurse?
Johnny Jones goes to Europe and hires a nurse.
That's gonna look great on the expense account.
I know a very efficient private detective agency where we can get just the man.
- Okay, whatever you say.
- I can arrange it all for you.
If it'll make you feel better, I won't mention it to anybody.
If anyone finds out I've hired a bodyguard, I'll shoot myself.
If that's Mr. Rowley, tell him to wait outside. Yes, sir.
I've called on Mr. Haverstock.
Will you tell him Mr. Rowley is here?
- Will you wait here, please? - Thank you.
- Mr. Haverstock, your cab's here.
- Where are you going?
- To the office. I've got work to do.
- But you mustn't go.
I was sent over here at great expense as a newspaperman, not a refugee.
- How about lunch at the Savoy?
- I'll see you out.
Johnny, please be careful.
I'll be all right.
Mr. Haverstock?
Is this the man?
Look, who's protecting who?
Well, I ain't lanky, sir, but I'm quick.
I take it you understand what to do.
You can trust me to take care of Mr. Haverstock.
Are we going now, sir?
Yes, you can take me to my office, and if you're good... - to the American Club.
- Right, sir.
You'll keep after this other thing?
As soon as there's news, I'll let you know. Then you can break the story. Good-bye.
Good-bye, sir.
Why, Carol.
Nothing must happen to him, Father. I just couldn't...
How do we go, sir?
Would you like me to walk behind you, or beside you, like a friend?
- What's the custom?
- Different people has different tastes. With the Duke of Albatrorr, the duke, being a democratic gent...
I used to walk alongside of him, man-to-man, like.
On the other hand, I once had a lady who thought that was disrespectful.
"Three paces behind," she says, "and don't smoke on duty."
What's good enough for a duke is good enough for me. Thank you, sir.
If we want to go to the American Club, we'd better take a cab.
What's the trouble, sir.
Is it gangsters after you?
Not exactly. We're not afraid of gangsters over here, sir.
- Even our police don't carry guns.
- What do they do? Hit you over the head with a stick.
A bit more healthy-like.
Did you see that?
Someone deliberately pushed me!
That was me, sir. If I'd have pulled you back, you'd have been caught. It was push or nothing.
Smart work, Mr. Rowley. Thank you very much.
After all, that's what I'm here for, isn't it?
- American Club. - Yes, sir. After you, sir.
I'm not certain, sir, but I've got an idea... two men just got in another cab to follow us.
I don't see anyone suspicious.
Well, I may have been mistaken... but I'm almost certain I saw them.
They may have heard where we're going. Driver.
Driver?
Go down Victoria Street... 'round past Buckingham Palace.
Right, sir.
We might give 'em the slip if we go the long way around.
I'm afraid they're still after us.
Our best plan is to pull 'round the next corner and change cabs.
Driver? Take the first to your left and pull up.
We're going to walk a bit.
I'll do it, sir. I understand the money. It'll be quicker.
Thank you, sir.
Our best plan is to slip into the cathedral for a bit.
Let's call off this ducking and let them catch up with us and have a showdown.
I wouldn't cause a scene.
Our job is to give 'em the slip.
All right. - Let's go.
- Nice bit of architecture, sir, innit?
Do you mind not going right in, sir?
I saw by the notice it was a requiem mass... a mass for the dead.
That sort of thing always depresses me ...praying for the dead and all that.
The dead are all right in their place, sir... but the music and the candles always gives me the creeps.
It does really, sir. I don't like to be so fussy...
How about a trip up top, sir?
That'd really put 'em off the scent.
Boys, careful there.
- I can't see.
- Eh?
Here, here.
There you are, me boy. Ooh!
Look, there it goes. There.
I'll have to buy you another now. Love a duck!
Careful, boys. You better be careful too, sir.
Not yet, boys.
Let's get out of here. I have a luncheon date and plenty to do before it.
I've got it in mind, sir. Don't you worry.
Really, now, look. Isn't it worthwhile coming up here to see it, sir?
There's the houses of Parliament over there.
And there's St. James's Park. That green patch.
Yeah. Come along, boys.
You must excuse me getting so scared when you leaned over just now, sir.
I was once with a man on a bridge in Switzerland.
He had a very nasty fall. Killed him.
Always made me a bit nervous since.
Don't go down just yet, sir. I'd like you to see St. Paul's.
There it is, just coming out of the mist. Oh, and look.
There's the 'orse guards approaching Buckingham Palace. - See 'em? Down there.
- It makes the backs of me legs go funny. Height always did.
Let's get down again, Eric.
Why didn't you say so before?
Miss, I know just how you feel. Them as has no head for heights can't help it.
Nobody ought not to blame them.
- What's it got to do with you? - All right, keep your head on. - I was only sympathizing.
- I'm going down anyway.
- Wait for the lift.
- No.
No stairs for me. I'm gonna take the elevator.
Wait a minute, sir. You ain't seen the 'orse guards yet.
You must see the 'orse guards, sir.
Where?
I don't see anything.
Why, there they are, sir. Down the road.
Just going toward the... the white building.
No, boys. This way.
Well, there but for the grace of God.
I still don't know what instinct made me step aside when he came at me.
You need a drink.
I heard the lift coming up, and I turned.
I saw that look in his eye as he came toward me.
In that split second, the whole thing flashed through my mind.
All I could think of was Fisher. "Fisher planned this."
Then I guess I just stepped aside, and over he went.
Over he went, all right.
Did you want this?
No, thanks. When are you going to send the story to our esteemed gazette?
When I get ready.
Well, there goes another of my illusions.
I thought you were one of those journalists nothing could stop.
Floods, smallpox, love... the story must go on.
It'll go on.
No.
I can understand you not wanting to drag Miss Fisher into it.
On the other hand, she's probably in it already.
- The moll of the gang.
- Why, you dirty...
On second thought, I'm sure not.
I'm sure she's a fine girl... upstanding, honest, with a great soul.
I can't send the story on Van Meer until he's safe. We've got to find Van Meer first.
Ah, there's our man now, probably.
Mr. Van Meer, come in.
Good morning, Stebbins. How are you, Haverstock?
Congratulations on your little set-to with Rowley.
What do you know about Rowley?
Very little ffolliott doesn't hear. He probably even knows about Fisher.
I was onto Fisher a year ago... but that fellow with the high-neck sweater...
- Krug... he's new to me... - You're onto him too?
- Followed him to London.
- I thought you were cold on this story.
On the contrary. I've been doing a bit of noticing.
- Remember that tramp asleep in the mill? - Yeah.
- He wasn't a tramp at all.
- Van Meer, I suppose.
Not quite, but I noticed him do a strange thing for a tramp.
He dirtied his hands with some of that nasty Dutch soil.
I can't follow the workings of these masterminds.
No. Tell him it's ridiculous.
You'd already disappeared, so I followed Krug... but ended up at the same old mousetrap.
You mean Fisher?
The good, kind, genial head of the Peace Party, Herr Fisher.
Hello, Eddie? This is Plunger Stebbins.
I want to place a bet on Flibbertigibbet in the first...
The race is over? What do you know about that?
Okay, I'll call you later.
Any objection to working the rest of this thing together?
Catch Fisher, find Van Meer, that sort of thing?
All right, but I'd like to know why they kidnapped Van Meer.
He was one of the signatories to a certain treaty.
The most important clause was never written down... just memorized by the two people who signed.
They're gonna beat it out of him? They're going to try.
It'd be a good idea if we put a stop to them.
It contains information that would be valuable to the enemy... in the war that breaks out tomorrow, weather permitting.
Why didn't someone let me in on this?
- Stebbins, we've got to get busy.
- Plenty of time. Lunch first. You mind waiting?
You might be of some help. I thought up a little plan for forcing Fisher's hand.
Let's have it.
I think the neatest thing would be to kidnap Fisher's daughter.
Oh, yeah?
One of Fisher's few genuine traits is his affection for Miss Fisher.
Easy. You're speaking to the man who loves her.
All the better. Give you a chance to get chummy... and keep her out of this mess while we batter away at papa.
This is my scheme:
I walk in, let Fisher know... his daughter's in the hands of someone who means business... just as he means business when he kidnaps people.
- I thought you were a newspaperman.
That doesn't include kidnapping your fiancee where I come from.
- It would if your country were at stake.
- This isn't my country.
It's your story. Don't be gloomy. She doesn't have to know.
- Just keep her amused. - Why not grab Fisher and have a showdown?
No good. We've got nothing on Fisher. He'd slip out of it anyway.
All we'd do would be to kill Van Meer.
Are you all right?
What were you doing on the tower?
Trying to keep out of harm's way, but those assassins followed.
There was a scuffle, and over he went.
Darling, they won't stop till they get you.
You must leave London immediately.
The one thing everybody forgets is I'm a reporter.
There's a war. I can't run out.
Scott, he can't stay here. Tell him how desperate these men are.
He shouldn't stay another minute. Take him somewhere.
I won't go.
Couldn't you think up some aunt in the country or something?
There's my Aunt Margaret at Harpenden. Let me take you there.
- How about it?
- Stay out of this.
It's the only sensible thing to do.
May I use your telephone?
Hello, Stiles? Miss Carol speaking.
Tell Mr. Fisher I'm driving down to Aunt Margaret's at Harpenden.
- I won't go.
- I'll be back in time for dinner. Thank you.
it's settled.
We can get you a toothbrush...
It's no good.
I'm wondering whether this idea of your aunt is so good.
Maybe it'd be better further out... say, Cambridge.
There's no place as obscure as Harpenden.
It isn't so much the place... as the fact Krug might connect you with it.
You're right. Make it Cambridge.
I'll phone your father so he doesn't worry. Thank you, Scott.
Please, Johnny?
That was a break, her suggesting they go to the country.
As a matter of fact, old boy, I suggested it to her... on the phone about half an hour ago.
There hasn't been a sign of anybody for the last 30 miles.
- What's the matter? - Nothing.
You might at least talk to me.
It's unfair to sit there and pout... because I've kidnapped you from your so-called duties.
- You've kidnapped me? - Mm-hmm.
- Just remember that, will you?
- Please forgive me.
Why, sure.
I don't think kidnapping's... anything to get sore about when done by the right kidnapper, do you?
- Not at all. - Thanks.
Hello?
No, Mr. ffolliott.
I'm afraid he's not in yet. Very well, sir.
- Johnny, you don't love me.
- You're crazy. - You looked unhappy when you kissed me.
- Never happier in my life.
Won't do. Johnny, what's happened?
The war, I guess. They say it's coming tomorrow.
So you've changed your philosophy since yesterday.
There are more important things in the world than love.
- I've got lots to do.
Important things. - Carol...
Got to get started. It'll take three hours to get back.
I'm not going to be misunderstood.
I'm so in love, I'm going mad.
Won't do.
I suppose it can't be helped. You've turned European on me overnight, Johnny.
That's unfair. I'm just as big a jackass as I ever was.
Bigger. You're not going back to London to dinner tonight.
You can't run out on your kidnapper like that.
I mean... Well, you know what I mean.
If you run out on me now, I'm going... straight to London and let them bump me off.
Be a relief at that.
Well, you are moody. Am I the cause?
If you knew how much I loved you, you'd faint.
There. What'd I tell you?
Come in.
- Mr. Haverstock?
- Yes? - Call from London.
- Have them switch it up.
Sorry, there's only one phone...
in the office. All right, I'll come down.
Forgive me for a moment, dear.
Just a moment, sir.
Hello?
Is that you, Haverstock, old boy?
Are you alone?
Can you talk? I can't get a hold of Fisher. He's been out all afternoon.
I'm afraid you'll have to keep the girl much longer than we'd planned.
I don't know what time he'll be back.
I've got to catch him alone. Keep the girl there for the night.
But that's absolutely impossible.
We can't let this thing go now.
I can't very well explain, but I simply couldn't pull a thing like that.
You've got to try. There isn't anything else to be done.
I'm counting on you.
Hello?
Hello?
Are you quite satisfied with your room, sir?
Well, not exactly.
That is, I mean, yes... but I really wanted another room as well... a single room.
Oh.
Mr. Naismith? Mr. Naismith, this gentleman wants another room.
For the young lady? How long will you be requiring it?
She'll only be here just the one might.
- The gentleman has number 7, sir.
- What about number 8?
It doesn't really make any difference, so long as it's a good room...
windows and all that. I quite understand, sir. I think perhaps the room next to yours would be best.
It's quite cozy, isn't it, Miss Pollitt?
Number 8? - They're all very much alike to me, sir.
- Eight'll do.
Will you bring the young lady and sign the book, please?
Yes, I'll... I'll get her.
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Stiles.
Terrible thing, sir, that poor man who was here this morning.
Yes, terrible, Stiles. My bags all packed?
- Yes, sir.
- And Miss Carol's?
Mrs. Stiles packed hers too.
She hopes she's put in the right things. It's been such a rush, especially with Miss Carol not back yet.
Mr. ffolliott's here now. He's waiting in the sitting room.
Another gentleman just phoned. He wouldn't leave his name.
I thought I recognized his voice as the foreign gentleman who was here at breakfast.
- Did he say he'd telephone again?
- Yes, he said it was urgent.
Well, show Mr. ffolliott into the study.
Hello, sir. Scott, you caught me at a very busy moment. I'm getting ready to go to America tomorrow.
Are you taking Carol with you?
Yes. She doesn't know yet.
It's been such a rush. I'm waiting for her now.
What's your worry? Must be important, by the number of times you telephoned.
Yes, it is, sir.
It's about Carol. - I'm afraid that... - What?
Anything happen to her?
I don't think you'll be able to take her to America.
What do you mean? Why not?
It'll sound rather silly to you, but Carol has been kidnapped.
- Is this a joke of some sort?
- No, sir.
What do you mean, "kidnapped"?
I happen to know she's with her aunt in Harpenden.
I'm afraid she isn't.
Stiles, who gave you the message that Miss Carol had gone to her Aunt Margaret's?
Miss Carol herself, sir.
- Thank you, Stiles. - That's where she thought she was going.
Get me Harpenden 43422.
Hello, is that you, Margaret?
Is Carol with you?
No. No, I...
I wasn't' certain. She said she might run down to see you.
I didn't know whether to expect her back for dinner.
Right. Good night, Margaret.
No, she isn't there.
What makes you say she's been kidnapped?
Well, sir...
I arranged it.
This has gone far enough. Where is Carol?
Carol's being held as a sort of hostage... by some people who are very much in earnest... as much as you are.
Don't be so cryptic.
I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
I want to know where you're hiding Van Meer.
So that's it. You've been talking with Haverstock.
He was here this morning telling us about Van Meer still being alive.
You promised Haverstock you'd look into it, didn't you?
Naturally.
An unusual way of looking into it, trying to have him put out of the way.
I realize a life or two is a small matter, the way you work.
Well, the people who have got Carol can take a leaf out of your book.
Where is she?
What have you done with her?
Where's Van Meer?
Hello?
I think I can get our Dutch friend to talk if you come along.
Sorry to drag you here like this, but I think it's the only way... if you want to leave tomorrow.
When you get here, ask at the cashier's desk... to use the phone.
They'll show you straight up.
Very well. I'll drop in as soon as I can.
If you want Carol, you'd better tell me where Van Meer is.
Bring her back. I'll give you the address.
Carol can be home in three hours... but I want that address now.
You'll have it as soon as Carol is home.
I can't possibly wait three hours.
Besides, I happen to want Van Meer alive.
Well, Scott, I delivered him, all right.
Good. I'll be getting along now.
Thanks very much for those points for my leader. Can I take them now? Good night, Carol.
Good night, sir. Good night.
This isn't like you. What is it that's upset you so?
I know I'm being silly. I'm behaving perfectly stupidly.
I wouldn't mind so much... but I didn't think he was that sort of person.
Something to do with young Haverstock?
You like him very much, don't you?
After what happened today... I drove him down to the country to get him away from those people...
I thought you were going to Aunt Margaret's.
We were, but Scott ffolliott... thought it would be better to go further away.
So... I thought the College Arms at Cambridge would be a good place.
When we got there, I found out he wanted...
You see, we'd been joking about it... but when I heard him book the extra room, I knew he meant it.
Such a cheap trick.
That's what hurts." It was so cheap.
It wasn't at all like I thought he was.
What difference does it make?
I don't care if I ever see him again.
You won't have to. We're going to America tomorrow by clipper.
Tomorrow?
I suppose I can, but why tomorrow? It's our last chance.
War will probably be declared tomorrow. I have to get to Washington. The boats will be crowded.
We're liable to wait weeks.
- But what about Mr. Van Meer?
- We've done all we could.
I was at the foreign office with Ainsworth this afternoon. They're taking the whole thing over.
Stiles, what is it?
The blackout, sir. I have to draw the blinds. Oh, I forgot.
Before you do that, order me a taxi, will you? Yes, sir.
I've got people I must see before we leave.
I'll try not to be long. Mrs. Stiles has done your packing.
I thought we might go to Southampton, stay at the Southwestern. Stiles, and my hat, please.
Good-bye, darling.
In the meantime, you and Stiles might be loading the car so as not to lose time.
- You'd better eat.
- What about you? I'll get a sandwich later.
242 Charlotte Street... halfway up Tottenham Court Road.
Wait here until Haverstock turns up.
He's bound to come here.
Bring him along to 242 Charlotte Street... off Tottenham Court Road.
- Hello? - Hello.
Hello?
Be careful.
Might I use your telephone?
This way, sir.
Where is he?
In there.
We can't make him say anything. It's up to you.
Let's get it over. Is this place safe?
There'll be no interruption. We closed it for decoration.
- Those people downstairs?
- They won't make any trouble.
They know what will happen to their relatives in the homeland if they do.
Not a very attractive nest, and the music a little vulgar... but if serves its purpose.
Yes.
Pardon me.
Put your arm around him... and hold his head forward.
These lights... can't you cut them down?
I thank you.
You're like my friend, Mr. Fisher.
I'm sorry. It's just so dark.
I cannot tell, but... but you are so like my friend.
Oh! I am so glad.
Mr. Fisher, are the police here?
Oh, they mustn't get away.
You mustn't let these people go.
I represent the Jupiter Life Assurance. Could I interest you in a small policy?
- Why did you bring him up?
- I didn't know what to do.
I'd relieve the lady of this embarrassment... but you know how women are with firearms.
No sense of timing. I'll just sit here.
You carry on with whatever you were doing. Don't mind me. I sometimes sit like this for hours.
Who's that?
Is it the police?
Oh, tell me where I am.
You are in London, Mr. Van Meer.
In London?
Have I been here long?
Oh, you must send a telegram... to my wife.
Tell her I am safe with you. Please try to understand. The police are not here.
I am here merely to talk to you.
But these... these people...
They think I'm working with them.
They don't know I'm your friend.
We must play a little game.
- A little game? - Yes.
They have asked me to get you to tell me... what they are trying to find out.
But I can't do that.
You can tell me, Mr. Van Meer.
Just that one clause in the treaty.
Clause 27.
Come, Mr. Van Meer.
But it's the... the secret clause.
I know it: Clause 27.
But they... they mustn't know it.
It would help them if they make war. War, Fisher.
You don't want them helped, do you?
Of course not. Just let them see you telling it to me.
It'll be enough. Just let them see you whisper it to me.
I'll promise to keep it safe.
He's not your friend. Don't fell him.
Who was that?
Someone just said you weren't my friend.
Why didn't you bring the police?
Ah. You are not taking me away.
Why?
You are so...
F-Fisher?
Help me.
Help me, Fi...
Oh, yes.
I see now. There's no help.
No help for the whole... poor, suffering world. Oh, you... you cry peace, Fisher.
Peace. And there was no peace.
Only war and death.
You're...
You're a liar, Fisher. A cruel, cruel liar.
You can do what you want with me.
That's not important. But you'll never conquer them, Fisher.
Little people everywhere... who give crumbs to birds... lie to them... drive them, whip them... force them into war.
When the beasts like you... will devour each other... then the world... will belong to the little people.
We're wasting valuable time.
Kurt.
All right. I... I will speak.
I will tell everything. Come on, Mr. Fisher.
In the event of invasion by an enemy...
Why, it's only a restaurant.
Look! Come on!
This way, sir! Down the back stairs!
Follow me!
Come on, Haverstock!
They must've gone out some other way!
You're an idiot if you don't nab Fisher before he gets on that plane.
How can we arrest him without any evidence?
Don't be so obstinate. isn't Van Meer himself proof enough?
No, and you ought to know it.
What proof is there against Fisher personally?
Of all the conceited, stupid numbskulls...
If you'd stop behaving like a Boy Scout and let us handle this...
Ask McKenna to come in here.
Why don't you go see Dr. Boniface?
He's good for nerves. - Identification of Van Meer complete?
- Absolutely.
He's unconscious in the nursing home, but there's no doubt it's Van Meer. You'd better get back there.
Take somebody with you.
Get a statement as soon as he comes to.
In the meantime, send a man to keep an eye on that flying boat and await instructions from us.
What's the good of being related to Scotland Yard?
I can't get my brother to do anything.
Scotland Yard can't solve my problems.
Scotland Yard's in on it.
Everybody but me. You're in it too.
We've got to get on that plane and keep an eye on Fisher.
While we're driving down, ring up Mayfair 24574.
- Just a moment.
Let me get it down. - Mayfair 24574. That's my cousin.
He's the director of the airline.
Tell him I've got to have two seats on the clipper for America tomorrow morning.
Then go to the Hilton Nursing Home and stick by Van Meer.
Then phone Miss Edith Armbruster, Kensington 66255 Tell her I'm off to America.
Will she dine with me next Monday instead of tomorrow?
- Square it with her, will you .7
- Sure, sure. Then call up Stephens at the Post and tell him I'm off to America.
Cable New York. Tell them I'm off to America.
Then ring up the Crescent Dancing Academy and cancel my rumba lesson. Two ham sandwiches on rye bread.
There's no use my waiting around. I have several things...
Hard to say how soon he'll recover.
It may be hours before he can speak.
I don't know much about this, but my friend's on the clipper.
The minute Van Meer speaks, they'll send word to the plane.
Did you hear the wireless?
We're at war. War declared! Read all about it!
Special war edition! War declared!
It's war with Germany! War declared!
Miss Pimm? Miss Pimm, I found that picture.
- Steward, bring me one of those, please. - Yes, sir.
- Any message for me? - What name, sir?
Steward, is there a message for me?
Mrs. Benson. I'll be with you in a minute, madam.
- This one's for me.
Lovely, isn't it? Sort of makes you forget all about the war and troubles.
It would be nice if we could just keep flying... for a long time, live in the clouds.
Yes, it would be very nice.
But it's time for me to make a landing... a forced landing.
What's the matter?
Anything happen?
I've got to talk to you. I don't want to, but I've got to.
It's the hardest part... talking to you now. I don't mind about the rest, really.
It's about Krug and Van Meer.
You've guessed.
Not till last night. I've just been worried.
But I believed in you.
You shouldn't. It's true, then, what I wouldn't believe?
Yes.
I'm to be arrested when we land... - Oh!
- As a spy, shipped back to London.
- That's quite all right, except... just the one phase of it: you.
I should like you to hear a little from my own point of view.
It might help you...
afterwards. First about yourself, my deceiving you.
I had to.
I didn't want you involved because you're English... half English, anyway.
I'm not. I'm just coated with an English accent... a very thin coat.
I've fought for my country in my heart in a very difficult way... because sometimes it's harder to fight dishonorably... than nobly in the open.
I've used my country's methods because I was born with them.
I don't intend making this sort of plea to the court-martial.
I'm making it only to my daughter, whom I've loved dearly... and before whom I feel a little... ashamed.
What you say to me now means much more to me than any other verdict... my dear.
- Steward? - Yes, sir? This is not for me.
I'm not gonna sit here another 14 hours and play hide-and-seek with her.
I'm gonna talk to her and have it over with.
I don't see that you could do any harm.
He knows we're on the plane. - Not a word in front of her, understand?
- I wouldn't dream of talking.
- What are you going to say?
- How do I know?
I'm all mixed up. In love with the girl and gonna help hang her father.
I've got to say something or go crazy.
Would a little brandy make you feel better?
You know it always makes me cry harder. - Oh!
- Surprise.
- What are you doing here?
- Just having myself a ride.
Look, Carol, I've got to speak to you alone. It's very important. Do you mind, Mr. Fisher?
- ffolliott's with you, isn't he?
- In a way, yes. And you're both after my father.
You're going to have him arrested, aren't you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I never arrested anyone in my life.
That's a lie. You've been following him from the beginning.
That's why you wanted me out of the way yesterday at the inn.
Pretended you loved me, tried to keep me overnight so you could... it's a lie, that's all.
Everything you've said to me have been lies. - Hello.
Quite a reunion, isn't it?
- You too?
Please, dear. Stay and have a drink, Scott. - I'll be back.
- Where are you going? Just to stretch my legs.
I read that wireless you received.
- It was given to me by mistake.
- That's all right, sir.
You're not going unless I go with you. I know you both think my father is a traitor and a renegade.
Well, he isn't... not to me.
Thanks.
It's a minority report, but very welcome.
Carol, I've got nothing to do with spies. I'm just a reporter.
I came here after a story.
I'm sorry I heard of Van Meer.
I'd blow up the Globe... and cut Mr. Powers's throat rather than harm you.
What is it?
They've gone crazy.
What do they think they're doing?
Who are they?
Go below.
Tell them we're being attacked.
Sorry about this. It has nothing to do with me. We're coming down.
You're the most amazing, cool-headed woman I've ever seen.
- Make Father wear this. - Right. Here you are.
Put these on.
Could you come out, sir? They're all going nuts!
I'll be out immediately. What am I going to say?
This isn't like bad weather. Tell them it's a mistake, that it's target practice.
I know it's foolish for me to ask you to be calm.
Are we all going to be drowned?
Keep away from that window, sir. It might be dangerous. Sit back.
I'm not going to put this on.
What are they firing at? I never heard of anything so stupid.
I shall see the British consul as soon as...
She's gone.
What in the name of heaven are they doing?
Switch off the gas. You've got the other port motor. They cut off the other starboard motor.
Right. It's German, the Von Schier.
She thought we were a bomber.
She's steaming to our rescue.
The Wing's coming off!
- Let me get out!
- Come away from that door!
We're crazy to stay here.
When she hits the water, the tail's the best place. Right.
Mr. Fisher!
No good staying on here. She's going under.
Quick! Onto the wing!
There's the pilot!
Don't let him on, fools! We shall all go down!
Shut your mouth!
- I'm gonna throw that swine off.
- No, he's right. It won't hold us.
I'd better slip away.
Quickly move to the other end. That might make it lighter here.
He's gone!
Johnny, don't go! You'll be washed away!
Johnny, come back!
Look!
It must be the enemy coming to pick us up.
Is it the enemy?
She's American.
American ship Mohican picked us all up, taking us back to London.
I can't tell you what happened. We're not allowed.
I'll wire from London in a couple of days. Bye, Franklin. This is awkward.
I've just been having a dirty row with the captain.
The fellow insists on acting the true-blue neutral.
"Enemy waters." Not a line to the press from his ship.
Can't send out any stories?
We can only use the wireless for private messages.
"Hello, Aunt Effie. Safe aboard the Mohican. Feeling tip-top."
I ask you!
Two days before we get to London, we get scooped on our own story.
Why don't you have a crack at brass buttons?
What's the use? What good will it do me?
My hands are tied. - What are you talking about?
- Carol.
I came 4,000 miles to get a story.
I get shot at like a duck, pushed off buildings...
I get the story, and then I got to shut up.
What are you grinning at? I'm not gonna throw her father up for grabs.
He died like a hero to save her and the rest of us.
I guess I'm talking through my hat.
The whole point is he was her father... and I'm not gonna play Judas to the only girl...
I'm glad you've said that. Very glad. - You dry?
You all right? - I'm all right.
I want you to send it, the whole story.
- We'll talk about that later.
- No, please. You can't help me by protecting my father.
Listen, I'm in love with you. I can't hit you with a scandal for a wedding present.
Johnny, my father fought for his country his way.
It wasn't a straight way, but it was a hard way.
And I've got to fight for my country a hard way.
Okay, if that's the way you feel about it. I guess that's for me.
I put in a call to my uncle... Uncle Powers.
Hello? Hello?
Johnny Jones calling from the Mohican. What the deuce is he doing there?
Wait.
Johnny wouldn't call if it wasn't a story. Tell them to hold the presses.
Send Bradley in. Tell him we're breaking up page one.
Hello? Hello, Mr. Powers.
This is Johnny Jones.
Easy.
Here comes the captain.
Mr. Powers, keep your ear glued to this phone... and don't hang up.
Mr. Haverstock, I want to talk with you.
Yes, sir?
I've just found out you're a newspaperman.
I guess that's right.
Why didn't you tell me that when I questioned you? - You lied to me, sir.
- My dear captain... when you've been shot down in a British plane by a German destroyer... 300 miles off the coast of England...
latitude 45... and have been hanging on to a half-submerged wing for hours... waiting to drown with half a dozen other stricken human beings... you're liable to forget you're a newspaperman for a moment.
You're gonna have to forget it for as long as you're on this ship.
I can't understand your attitude, sir.
You performed a heroic rescue. Captain John Martin. You took us out of the sea.
You're not sending anything from this ship. - That's final. - You're absolutely right, Captain.
We mustn't embarrass the United States government. Exactly.
That's my point.
That's the story. If you don't want me to print it, okay.
- But you ought to hear it first.
- That's only fair.
You know who the head of that movement was in London?
Stephen Fisher. What?
You mean the man who ran the Universal Peace Party?
Yes, the same Mr. Fisher who was drowned a few hours ago.
He was using the Peace Party as a cover-up for spies and traitors.
He was going to be arrested and sent back to England.
Those are facts. I can't believe it.
He was a friend of mine.
The same Stephen Fisher who engineered the kidnapping of Van Meer, the Dutch diplomat.
You don't expect anybody to believe that.
It's the truth.
- I refuse...
- Captain, wait a minute. This young lady should know whether my friend is speaking the truth about Mr. Fisher.
Yes, I ought to know. Mr. Fisher was... my father.
And I want the story printed.
What's that?
Oh, I guess that's my uncle.
Oh, hello, Uncle. How are you? How's Aunt Sadie?
I'm all right, thanks.
We had a little accident, but I can't tell you about it now.
I'll write you. Yes, I'm going back to Europe. I was wondering if you had any instructions for me.
Yes. Keep on the job.
Have you got all that?
Rush it out at once.
We have as a guest tonight... one of the soldiers of the press... one of the little army of historians writing history... from beside the cannon's mouth... the foreign correspondent of the New York Globe, Huntley Haverstock.
Hello, America.
I've been watching a part of the world being blown to pieces.
A part of the world as nice as Vermont and Ohio... and Virginia and California and Illinois... lies ripped up and bleeding like a steer in a slaughterhouse.
I've seen things that make the history of the savages read like Pollyanna legends... it's a raid.
We shall have to postpone the broadcast.
- Let's go on as long as we can.
- We have a shelter downstairs. How about it, Carol?
- They're listening in America, Johnny.
We'll tell them, then.
I can't read the rest of the speech... the lights have gone out... so I'll just have to talk off the cuff.
All that noise you hear isn't static. It's death coming to London.
They're coming now.
You can hear the bombs falling on the streets and homes.
Don't tune me out.
This is a big story, and you're part of it.
It's too late to do anything here except stand in the dark and let them come.
It's as if the lights were all out everywhere... except in America.
Keep those lights burning.
Cover them with steel, ring them with guns... build a canopy of battleships and bombing planes around them.
Hello, America! Hang on to your lights.
They're the only lights left in the world.
♪ And the rockets' red glare ♪ ♪ The bombs bursting in air ♪
- When you be back, Roy?
- Oh, in a couple of weeks.
- Don't do nothin' you wouldn't want me to hear about. - Oh!
- Well, so long! - So long!
How about a lift, mister?
- Can't you see that sticker?
- Sure, I see it... but a good guy don't pay no attention to what some heel makes him stick on his truck.
Well, scrunch down on the running board till we get around the bend.
- Going far?
- Nah, just a couple of miles.
I'd have walked 'er if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
- Looking for a job? - No.
My old man's got a place... 40 acres.
He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long while.
- Been doin' the job?
- Yeah.
I seen your hands.
You been swingin' a pick or a sledge. That's what makes them shiny.
I notice little things like that all the time.
Got a trade?
- Why don't you get at it, buddy?
- Get at what?
You know what I'm talking about. You been goin' over me ever since I got in.
- Why don't you ask me where I've been? - I don't stick my nose in anybody's business.
- Nah, not much!
- I stay in my own yard. That big nose of yours has been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch.
Well, I ain't keeping' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary...
- Been there four years. Anything else you want to know?
- You ain't gotta get sore. - Go ahead.
Ask me anything.
- I didn't mean nothin'.
Me, neither. I'm just trying to get along without shoving anybody, that's all.
See that road ahead?
That's where I get out.
You're about to bust a gut to know what I done, ain't you?
Well, I ain't a guy to let you down.
Homicide.
* Mm-mmm, He's my savior *
* Mmm, mmm, mmm, my savior *
* Mmm, mmm, mmm my savior now **
- Howdy, friend. - Howdy.
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad, old Tom's boy? Yeah.
I'm on my way home now.
Well, I do declare.
I baptized you, son.
Ain't you the preacher?
Used to be. Not no more.
I lost the call.
But, boy, I sure used to have it.
I used to get an irrigation ditch so squirming' full of repented sinners...
I'd pretty near drown half of'em.
But not no more.
I lost the spirit.
I got nothin' to preach about no more, that's all.
I ain't so sure of things.
I remember you preachin' a whole sermon... walkin' around on your hands, shouting' your head off.
Yeah, I remember. Went pretty good that way.
But that was nothin'.
Why, I preached a whole sermon once straddling' the ridgepole of a barn... like this.
- You see that one? - No. - You see that one?
- No.
You didn't?
Well, it's all gone, anyway.
You should've got yourself a wife.
Why, at my meetings, I used to get the girls a-glory-shoutin' till they about pass out.
Then I'd go to comfort 'em.
I'd always end up by lovin' 'em.
I'd feel bad and pray and pray, but it didn't do no good.
Next time, do it again.
I figured I just wasn't worth savin'.
Pa always says you was never cut out for no preacher.
I never let one get by me if I could catch her.
Have a snort?
But you wasn't a preacher!
A girl was just a girl to you.
To me, they's holy vessels.
I was savin' their souls.
I asked myself, what is this here called "Holy Spirit"?
Maybe that's love.
Why, I love everybody so much...
I'm fit to bust sometimes!
So maybe there ain't no sin and there ain't no virtue.
It's just what people does.
Some things folks do is nice and some ain't so nice.
And that's all any man's got a right to say.
Of course, I'll say a grace if somebody sets out the food... but my heart ain't in it.
- Nice drinking' liquor.
- Yeah, it ought to be. That's factory liquor. Cost me a buck.
You been out traveling' around?
Oh, ain't you heard?
It's been in the papers.
- No, I never. What?
- I been in the penitentiary for four years.
Oh, excuse me for askin'.
I don't mind no more. I'd do what I done again.
Killed a guy in a dance hall.
We was drunk, he got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel.
Knocked his head plumb to squash.
- You ain't ashamed? - Nah.
He had a knife in me...
That's why they only give me seven years. I got out in four... parole.
- Ain't seen your folks since?
- No, but I aim to 'fore sundown.
And I'm gettin' excited about it too.
Which way you goin'?
Oh, it don't matter.
Ever since I lost the spirit, I'd... it looks like I'd just as soon go one way as the other.
I'll go your way.
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper.
I ain't had pork but four times in four years... every Christmas.
I'll be glad to see your pa.
Last time I seen him was at a baptizing'.
He had one of the biggest doses of the Holy Spirit I ever seen.
Got to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf at moon time.
Finally, he picks hisself out a bush big as a piano.
And he lets out a squawk and takes a run at that bush.
Well, he cleared her... but he busted his leg snap 'n two doin' it.
There was a travelin' dentist there and he set her... and I give her a prayin' over... but there wasn't no more Holy Spirit left in your pa after that.
Listen.
That wind's fixin'to do somethin'.
Sure, it is. Always is this time of year.
Ma?
Pa?
Ma?
Ain't nobody here? Something's happened.
You got a match?
They're all gone or dead.
- They never wrote you nothin'?
- Nah, they wasn't people to write.
It's Ma's. She had 'em for years.
Used to be mine. I give it to Grandpa when I went away.
You reckon they're dead?
I never heard nothin' about it.
Tommy?
- Muley.! Where's my folks, Muley?
- Why, they gone.
I know they're gone, but where they gone?
It's Muley Graves. You remember the preacher, don't you?
- I ain't no preacher anymore.
- All right. You remember the man, don't you?
- Glad to see you again.
- Glad to see you.
- Now, where are my folks?
- They gone.
They gone to your UncleJohn's... the whole crowd of'em... two weeks ago.
But they can't stay there either, 'causeJohn's got his notice to get off.
Well, what happened?
How come they got to get off?
We lived here 50 years, same place.
Everybody's got to get off.
Everybody's leavin', goin' out to California.
Your folks, my folks, everybody's folks.
Everybody except me. I ain't gettin' off.
Who done it?
Listen. That's some of what done it.
The dusters. They started it, anyways.
Blowin' like this year after year.
Blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away... and blowin' us away now!
You crazy?
Some say I am.
- You want to hear how it happened?
- That's what I'm askin' you, ain't it?
Well, the way it happens... the way it happened to me... a man come one day... a man come one day...
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land... the tenant system don't work no more.
You don't even break even, much less show a profit.
Why, one man and a tractor can handle 12 or 14 of these places.
You just pay him a wage and take all the crop.
Yeah, but we couldn't do on any less than what our share is now.
Well, the children ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is.
And they're so ragged...
We'd be ashamed if everybody else's children wasn't the same way.
I can't help that. All I know is I got my orders.
They told me to tell you to get off, and that's what I'm tellin' ya.
You mean get off my own land?
Now, don't go to blaming' me. It ain't my fault.
- Whose fault is it?
- You know who owns the land...
The Shawnee Land and Cattle Company.
- And who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Company?
- It ain't nobody. It's a company.
They got a president, ain't they?
They got somebody that knows what a shotgun's for, ain't they?
Oh, son, it ain't his fault, because the bank tells him what to do.
All right, where's the bank? Tulsa. And what's the use of pickin' on him?
He ain't nothin' but the manager, and he's half crazy hisself... tryin' to keeping' up with his orders from the East.
- Then who do we shoot?
- Brother, I don't know.
If I did, I'd tell you. I just don't know who's to blame.
Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, there ain't nobody gonna push me off my land!
My grandpa took up this land 70 years ago!
My pa was born here! We was all born on it!
And some of us was killed on it!
And some of us... died on it.
And that's what makes it our'n... bein' born on it... and workin' on it... and dyin'... dyin' on it!
And not no piece of paper with writing' on it...
Well, what happened?
They come. They come and pushed me off.
- They come with the Cats.
- The what?
The Cats. The Caterpillar tractors.
And for every one of'em... there was 10, 15 families throwed right out of their homes.
A hundred folks and no place to live but on the road.
The Rances, the Peterses, the Perrys, theJoads.
One right after the other, they got throwed out.
Half the folks you and me know throwed right out into the road.
The one that got me come, oh, about a month ago.
- Go on back! Go on back! - Tell 'em, Muley.
I'm warnin' you, go on back!
You come any closer and I'm gonna blow you right out of that Cat!
I told you.!
Why, you'reJoe Davis's boy!
I don't like for nobody to draw a bead on me.
Then what are you doin' a thing like this for, against your own people?
$3.00 a day... that's what I'm doin' it for.
I got two little kids at home, my wife, my wife's mother.
Them folks got to eat. First and only, I think about my own folks.
What happen to other people... their own lookout.
Yeah, but you don't understand, son.
This is my land! Used to be your land. It's the company's now.
Have it your own way, son... but just as sure as you touch my house with that Cat...
I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come!
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere.
First place, they'd hang you, and you know it.
For another, it wouldn't be two days 'fore they'd send another guy up here to take my place.
Now, go on! Get out of the way!
What was the use?
He was right, and there wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
Just, it don't seem possible, just gettin' throwed off like that.
The rest of my family set out for the West.
There wasn't nothing to eat, but I couldn't leave.
Somethin'just wouldn't let me.
So now I just wander around and sleep wherever I am.
I used to tell myself that I was lookin' out for things... so that when the folks come back, everything'd be all right.
But I knowed it wasn't true.
There ain't nothin' to look out for... and there ain't nobody ever comin' back.
They're gone!
And me, I'm just an old graveyard ghost.
That's all in the world I am!
Do you think I'm touched?
No.
You're lonely, but... you ain't touched.
Well, it don't matter.
If I'm touched, I'm touched, and that's all there is to it.
Thing I don't understand is my folks taking it.
Like Ma. I seen her nearly beat a peddler to death with a live chicken.
She aimed to go for him with the ax she had in her other hand.
She got mixed up, forgot which was which... and when she got through with that peddler, all she had left was two chicken legs.
Just a... Just a plain, old graveyard ghost.
That's all.
She's settling'.
What do you figure on doin'?
Ah, it's hard to say.
Stay here till morning. Go to UncleJohn's, I reckon.
After that, I don't know.
Listen.
That's them... them lights.
Come on! Come on! We got to hide out.
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Well, you're trespassing, Tom!
This ain't your land no more, and that's the superintendent with a gun.
Come on!
Come on, Tom. You're on parole.
Muley!
All you got to do is hide and watch.
- Won't they come out here?
- I don't think so.
- One came out once and I clipped him from behi... - Shh.
Behind with-with a fence stake.
They ain't bothered since.
He ain't here.
If anybody ever told me I'd be hiding out at my own place...
Lord, make us grateful for what we are about to receive for His sake. Amen.
I seen you. You ate during' grace. Just one little dab!
Just one teeny little dab, that's all! Ain't he messy, though?
I seen him, gobbling' away like an old pig!
Why don't you keep your eyes shut during' grace, you old...
What's it say again, UncleJohn?
It says, "Plenty of work in California. 800 pickers wanted."
Wait till I get to California!
I'm gonna reach up and pick me an orange whenever I want it!
Or some grapes! Now... Now-Now-Now, there's somethin' I ain't never had enough of.
I'm gonna get me a whole big bunch of grapes off of the bush... and I'm gonna squash them all over my face... and let the juice drain down off of my chin.
Praise the Lord for vittery!
M-M-M-Maybe I'll get me a whole washtub full of grapes... and just sit in 'em and scrounge around in 'em until they're all gone.
I sure would like that.
Yes, sir, I sure would like that. Yeah.
Oh, thank God! Thank God!
Tommy.!
Ma.
Oh! You didn't bust out, did you?
You ain't gotta hide, have ya?
No, Ma, I'm paroled. I was so scared we was goin' away without you... and we'd never see each other again. I got my papers.
Oh.
I'd have found you, Ma.
Muley told me what happened.
You goin' to California true?
Oh, we got to go, Tommy, but it's gonna be all right.
I seen the handbills about how much work they is and high wages too.
There's somethin' I gotta find out first, Tommy.
Did they hurt you, son?
Did they hurt you and make you mean mad?
- Mad, Ma? - Sometimes they do.
No, Ma. I was at first, but not no more.
Sometimes they do somethin' to you.
They hurt you and you get mad and then you get mean.
Then they hurt you again and you get meaner and meaner... till you ain't no boy nor man anymore... just a walkin' chunk of mean mad.
Did they hurt you that way, son?
No, Ma, don't worry about that.
Well, I... I don't want no mean son.
- It's Tommy!
It's Tommy back! - Tommy.!
- What'd you do, son, bust out?
- * Tommy's out of jail *
- * Tommy's out of jail, Tommy's out of... ** - l... I knowed it!
You couldn't keep him in!
You can't keep a Joad in jail!
I knowed it from the first!
Get out of my way!
I told you so! I told you!
Tom'd come bustin' out of that jail just like a bull through a corral fence!
- You can't keep a Joad in jail!
- I didn't bust out. They paroled me.
L-I was that way myself.
How are you, UncleJohn?
- Hello, Tommy.
I'm feelin' fine. - You can't keep a Joad in jail.!
- How are you, Noah?
- Fine, Tommy.
- Bust out?
- No, paroled.
- Hello. - Tommy!
The jailbird's back! The jailbird's back!
Tommy's back! Tommy's back!
Jailbird's back!
- Hiya, Al.! - Hello, Tom. Did you bust out of jail?
- Nah. They paroled me.
- Aw... Rosasharn!
Busted out!
That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.
She's due now about three, four months.
She wasn't any more than a kid when I went up.
- Hi, Rosasharn.
- How are you, Tom?
Uh, this is Connie, my husband.
- Did you...
- I'm on parole.
Eh, if this don't beat all. I see I'm gonna be an uncle soon.
Oh, you do not!
- Here you go! - Look at the front!
Hey, Joad!
John Joad!
- You ain't forgot, have you?
- We ain't forgot.
We'll be comin' through here tomorrow, you know.
I know. We be out.
We be out by sunup.
How'd you get all this money?
We sold things, chopped cotton... even Grandpa.
Got us about $200, all told.
Shucked out 75 for this here truck.
Still got nearly 150 to set out on.
I figure we ought to be able make her on that.
Easy. After all, they ain't but about 12 of us, is they? - She'll probably ride like a bull calf, but she'll ride!
- Tom.!
Well, I reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out... if we aim to get out of here by daylight.
- How about it, John?
How are you boys comin'?
- All right.
Ma.!
I'm ready.
Rosasharn, honey, wake up the children! We're fixin' to leave.
Ruthie, Winfield, jump up, now. Ruthie, Winfield, jump up, now.
Where's Grandpa?
Al, go get him.
I'm gonna get up front. Somebody help me. - Wait a minute...
- Somebody help me. - * We're going to California *
- Here kids. Kids, you climb up on top.
Al's gonna drive, Ma. You set up there with him and Grandma, and we'll swap around later.
- Where we go, Pa?
- Connie, help Rosasharn up there alongside the kids.
- * We're going to California We're going to California
- Where's Grandpa? - Grandpa! - Where he always is, probably.
Oh! Grandpa!
Grandpa! Well, save my place. John, you and Noah climb up and find yourself a place.
Got to kind ofkeep her even all around.
Think it'll hold?
If it does, it'll be a miracle out of scripture.
Ma.!
Pa.!
Darn ya! Let...
- You little... - There's somethin' the matter with Pa.
- Stand still!
- There's somethin' wrong with him!
Should've left me alone, that's all. That's all wh...
What's the matter, Grandpa?
What's the matter?
There's nothin' the matter.
I just... I just ain't goin', that's all.
What do you mean, you ain't goin'?
We got to go. We got no place to stay.
I ain't talkin' about you! I'm-I'm talkin' about me!
I give her a good goin' over all last night, and I'm a-stayin'.
But you can't do that, Grandpa!
This here land's goin' under the tractor. We all got to get out.
All except me, and I'm stayin'.
- What about Grandma? - Take her with ya!
- Who'd cook for you, Grandpa?
How you gonna live?
Muley's livin', ain't he?
And I'm twice the man that Muley is!
Now, listen to me, Grandpa. Listen to me just a minute.
And I ain't listening', either!
I's told you what I was gonna do... and I don't give a hoot and a holler... if there's oranges and grapes a-crowdin' a feller out of bed!
I ain't goin' to California!
This is my country, and I belong here!
Yes, my... my dirt.
It's no good, but it's... it's mine, all mine.
Either we gotta tie him up and throw him in the truck or somethin'.
He can't stay here. No, can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him, or he'll get so mad he'll hurt hisself.
- Reckon we could get him drunk?
- Ain't no whiskey, is there?
Now, wait. They's a half a bottle of soothing' syrup here.
Here. Used to put the children to sleep.
- Don't taste bad. - There's some coffee left. We can fix him a cup.
That's right, and douse some in it.
Better give him a good dose. He's mighty muleheaded.
If Muley...
If Muley can scrabble along, I...
I guess I can.
I smell spareribs.
Huh. Somebody's been eatin' spareribs.
How come I ain't got none?
Well, I got some saved for you, Grandpa.
Got some a-warmin' now. - Eh? - But here's a cup of coffee for you first.
Uh, get me a mess of spareribs.
I want a great big mess of spareribs!
I'm-I'm hungry.
Why, sure, you're hungry.
I sure do like spareribs.
Yeah.
- Get up there, Noah. - Put his feet in there first, now.
Lend a hand. Easy, now. Easy!
Better throw somethin' over him so he won't get sunstruck.
Everything all set now?
All right! Let her go, Al!
Here we go!
Get aboard, Ma!
- Well, good-bye and good luck. - Hold it, Al!
- Ain't you goin' with us? - I'd like to.
There's somethin' goin' on out there in the West... and I'd like to try and learn what it is... if you feel you got the room.
- Mmm. - Plenty of room! Get on!
- Hop on, Casy!
- Let her go, Al!
- California, here we come!
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?
Give the old place a last look?
We're goin' to California, ain't we? All right, then, let's go to California.
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
I never had my house pushed over before.
Never had my family stuck out in the road... never had to lose everything I had in life.
- I ain't goin'.
- It's gonna be all right, Grandpa.
- That's good right there, Ma.
- I ain't goin'!
I ain't goin'. I ain't goin'. I ain't...
It's all right, Grandpa.
You're just tired, that's all.
That's it...
just tired. Just... tired.
"This here is William James Joad, died of a stroke.
"Old, old man.
"His folks buried him because they got no money... to pay for funeral..."Sss...
"Nobody killed him. Just a stroke and he died."
Figure best we leave something like this on him...
- unless somebody digs him up, makes out he was killed.
- Hmm. Looks like a lot of times the government's got more interest... in a dead man than a live one.
Not be so lonesome, knowin' his name's there with him.
Not just an old fella lonesome underground.
Won't you say a few words, Casy?
I ain't a preacher no more, you know.
We know, but ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
I'll say 'em, make it short.
This here old man just lived a life and just died out of it.
I don't know whether he was good or bad.
It don't matter much.
Heard a fella say a poem once... and he says, "All that lives is holy."
Well, I wouldn't pray just for an old man that's dead, 'cause he's all right.
If I was to pray, I'd pray for folks that's alive and don't know which way to turn.
Grandpa here, he ain't got no more trouble like that.
He's got his job all cut out for him, so... cover him up and let him get to it.
* I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad *
* I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad * * I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad *
* Oh, Lordy *
*I ain't a-gonna be
*A-treated this a-way
* They fed me on corn bread and beans
* They fed me on corn bread and beans
Huh.
Gosh. Connie sure sings pretty, don't he?
* Oh, Lordy
* I ain't a-gonna be a-treated this a-way **
- That's my son-in-law.
- Sings real nice.
- What state you all from?
- Oklahoma. Had us a farm there, sharecroppin'.
We're from Arkansas.
Had me a store there... kind of a general notions store.
When the farms went, the stores went too.
I had as nice a little store as you ever saw.
I sure did hate to give it up.
Well, you can't tell.
I figure when we get out there and get work... and maybe get us a piece of growing' land near water, it might not be so bad at that.
That's right. Payin' good wages, I hear.
- We can all get work. - Can't be no worse than home.
You all must have a pot of money.
No, we ain't got no money... but there's plenty of us to work, and we're all good men.
Get good wages out there and put it all together, and we'll be all right.
Good wages, eh?
Pickin' oranges and peaches?
- Well, we aim to take whatever they got.
- What's so funny about that? What's so funny about it?
I've just been out there. I've been and seen it.
I'm goin' back and starve, because I'd rather starve all over at once.
Say, what do you think you're talkin' about?
I got a handbill here says they're payin' good wages.
And I seen the papers that they need pickers.
All right, go on. Nobody's stoppin' ya.
- Yeah, but what about this?
- I ain't gonna rile ya.
Go on. What a minute, buddy. You just done some jackassin'.
You can't shut up now. The handbill says they need 800 pickers.
You laugh and say they don't. Which one's the liar?
How many of you all got them handbills?
- I got one. - Come on.
How many? - I got one. - We all got one.
What does that prove?
There you are... same yellow handbill.
"700 pickers wanted."
All right.
The man wants 700 men... so he prints 5,000 handbills, and maybe 20,000 people see them... and maybe two or three thousand people start west on account of that handbill.
Two or three thousand people that are crazy with worry... heading out for 700 jobs.
- Now, does that make sense?
- Say, what are you, a troublemaker?
You sure you ain't one of them labor fakes?
L...
I swear I ain't, mister. Well, don't you go around here trying to stir up any trouble.
I tried to tell you folks what it took me a year to find out.
Took two kids dead, took my wife dead to show me... but nobody could tell me, neither.
I can't tell you about them little fellas laying' in their tent... with their bellies swelled out and just skin over their bones... a-shiverin'and a-whinin'like pups.
And me a-runnin'around lookin'for work... not for money, not for wages... just for a cup offlour and a spoon oflard.
Then the coroner come.
"Them children died of heart failure," he said. He put it down on his paper.
Heart failure?
And their little bellies stuck out like a pig bladder?
Well, guess we gotta get some sleep.
Well, good night, folks.
Suppose he's tellin' the truth, that fella?
He's tellin' the truth... the truth for him.
He wasn't makin' it up.
Was it the truth for us?
I don't know.
- I got to get out.
- Okay. I got to get out now.!
- You folks aim to buy anything?
- We want some gas, mister.
- Got any money?
- What do you think?
We're beggin'?
I just asked, that's all.
Well, ask right. You ain't talkin' to bums, you know.
All in the world I done was asked.
- Banana cream, pineapple cream... chocolate cream and apple.
Cut me off a hunk of that banana cream.
And a cup of java.
- Make it two.
- Two it is. Seen any good etchings lately, Bill?
Well, this one ain't bad. A little kid comes late for school, and the teacher says...
Cheese it.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am?
This ain't a grocery store. We got bread to make sandwiches with.
I know, ma'am. Only it's for an old lady, no teeth.
Got to soften it with water so she can chew it.
And she's hungry.
Why don't you buy a sandwich?
We got nice sandwiches. Well, I...
I sure would like to do that, ma'am... but the fact is, we ain't got but a dime for it.
It's all figured out...
I mean, for the trip. You can't buy no loaf of bread for a dime. We only got 15-cent loaves.
- Give him the bread.
- We'll run out 'fore the bread truck comes!
All right! Then we run out!
- This here's a 15-cent loaf.
- Well, would you... Could you see your way to cutting' off ten cents' worth?
- Give 'im the loaf.
- No, sir. We want to buy ten cents' worth, that's all.
Go on. It's yesterday's bread.
Go ahead. Bert says to take it.
Well, may sound funny bein' so tight... but we got a thousand miles to go... and we don't know if we'll make it.
- Eh, is them penny candies, ma'am?
- Which ones? - There, them stripy ones.
- Oh, them? Well, uh, no.
- Them's two for a penny.
Go on, take 'em.
Take 'em.
Them ain't two-for-a-cent candy.
- What's it to you? - Them's a nickel apiece candy.
We'd better get goin'.
- So long.
- Hey, wait a minute.
You got change comin'. What's it to you?
Bert.
Look.
Truck drivers.
- Where you going?
- California.
- How long you plan to be in Arizona?
- No longer than to get across. - Got any plants?
- No.
Okay.
Go ahead, but keep movin'. We aim to.
Well, there she is, folks. The land a milk and honey...
California.
Well, if that's what we come out here for...
Well, Connie, maybe it's nice on the other side.
Them little picture postcards, they was real pretty.
There, Grandma. There's California.
She don't look so tough to me, eh, John? Well, I don't know.
Hold on.
Ain't too cold is she, Tom?
No. It's fine when you get in, Pa!
Come on, John. Let's give her a whirl.
You know, this is supposed to be good for ya, John.
- Come on, Pa, before she floats away!
- You people got a lot of nerve.
- What you mean? Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this. - You been across?
- Sure, plenty, but... never in no wreck like that.
If we break down maybe somebody'd give us a hand.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it.
Takes more nerve than I got. It don't take no nerve to do somethin' ain't nothin' else you can do.
Hope she holds.
Grandpa.
I want Grandpa.
I want Grandpa.
Oh, don't you fret now.
Oh, there.
Don't you fret now, Grandma.
Everybody set back there?
- Yep. - All right, here we go!
Thank ya very much.
Holy Moses, what a hard-lookin' outfit.
All them Okies is hard-lookin'.
Boy, but I'd hate to hit that desert in a jalopy like that.
You and me got sense. Them Okies got no sense or no feelin'.
They ain't human. No, a human being wouldn't live way they do.
Human being' couldn't stand to be so miserable.
Just don't know any better, I guess.
What a place!
How'd you like to walk across her?
People done it. If they could, we could.
Lots must a died too.
Well, we ain't outta it yet.
- This here's the desert, and we're right in it!
- I wish it was day. Tom says if it was day, it'd cut the gizzard right out a ya.
I seen a picture once, and there was bones everywhere.
- Man bones? - Uh, some, I guess, but mostly cow bones.
I sure would like to see some of them man bones.
Grandpa. - I want Grandpa.
- Yes. Now, everything's going to be all right.
We got to get across, Grandma.
The family's got to get across.
There.
It seems like we wasn't never doin' nothin' but moving'.
- I'm tired. - Women is always tired.
You ain't... You ain't sorry, are you, honey?
No, but...
But you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine.
Don't pay nothin'.
Just send 'em the coupon... and you're a radio expert... nice clean work.
- But we can still do it, honey.
- I ought to done it then... not come on any trip like this.
- What's this here?
- Agricultural inspection.
We got to go over your stuff.
Got any vegetables or seed?
- No. - Well, we got to look over your stuff.
- You got to unload.
- Unload? Holy Moses.
Sorry, folks, but you'll have to get out while we unload for inspection.
Oh, look, mister.
We got a sick old lady. We got to get her to a doctor. We can't wait!
You can't make us wait!
- Yeah?
Well, we got to look you over.
- I swear we ain't got anything. I swear it.
And Grandma's awful sick.
Look.
You wasn't foolin'.
- You swear you got no fruit or vegetables?
- No, I swear it. Then go ahead. You can get a doctor at Barstow.
That's just eight miles. But don't stop.
Don't get off. Understand? - Thanks.
- Okay, cap.
Much obliged.
Ma!
Grandma!
There she is!
There she is! - I never knowed there was anything like her!
- Will ya look at her! Lookee yonder, John.
Look how pretty and green it is, Winfield.!
- Wonder if them's orange trees, John.
- Look like orange trees to me. - Well, they sure are pretty, whatever they are.
- Oh, yes indeed. Look at them haystacks.! I bet we could sure have fun playin'over there.
Pretty, ain't it?
Mighty pretty.
Where's Ma?
I want Ma to see this. Look, Ma!
- You sick, Ma?
- You say we got across?
- Look! - Oh, thank God!
And we're still together...
Didn't you sleep none?
- Was Grandma bad?
- Grandma's dead.
When?
Since before they stopped us last night.
That's why you didn't want 'em to look, huh?
Well, I was afraid they'd stop us and we wouldn't get across.
I told Grandma. I told her when she was dyin'.
I told her the family had to get across.
I told her we couldn't take no chance on bein' stopped.
So it's all right.
She'll get buried where it's nice and green... and trees and flowers all around and...
She got to lay her head down in California after all.
Whoa. That's good.
How far you figure you're gonna get that way, pushing'?
Right here. We run outta gas.
Where's the best place to get work around here?
- Yeah. - Don't matter what kind either.
Yeah, well, if I seen one a them things, I seen 10,000 of'em.
- Well, ain't it no good? - Not here.
Not now.
There was some pickin' around here about a month ago... but it's all moved south.
Hey, what part of Oklahoma you from anyhow?
- Sallisaw.
- Sallisaw? Why, I come out from Cherokee County myself about two years ago.
Well, you don't say!
All right! All right!
Let's don't go into it. What I got to tell ya is this.
Don't try to park in town tonight.
Just go right on out to that camp. If I catch ya in town after dark, I got to lock ya up.
- But-But what we gonna do?
- Well, Pop, that just ain't up to me.
I don't mind tellin' you, the guy they ought to lock up... is the guy that sent them things out.
How many, folks?
Sure don't look none too prosperous.
Want to go somewhere's else? On a gallon of gas?
Let's set up the tent, and maybe I can fix some stew.
I could break up some brush if you want me, ma'am.
You want to be asked to eat, don't ya? - Yes, ma'am.
- Didn't ya have no breakfast? No, ma'am.
There ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
Didn't none of these have no breakfast?
I did. Me and my brother did.
- We et good.
- Well, you ain't hungry then, are ya?
We et good.
Well, I'm glad some of ya ain't hungry... because there won't be enough to go around.
Aw, he was braggin'.
Know what he done? Last night, come out and say they got chicken to eat.
Well, sir, I looked in whilst they was a-eatin'... and it was fried dough just like everybody else.
Ma, how 'bout it?
Well, I don't know what to do. I've got to feed the family, and what am I gonna do about all of these here?
Give this to Ruthie.
Yeah.
There you are, John.
Here, Tom. You take it.
I ain't hungry.
- What do ya mean?
You ain't et today. - I know. But I got a stomachache.
I ain't hungry.
- Take that plate in the tent, and you eat it.
- Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see them in the tent.
You git.
Go on now, git! You ain't doin'no good. They ain't enough for youse anyway.
Go on... now.
We can't send 'em away.
Here. Take your plates and go inside.
Now, look, all you little fellers.
You each go and get ya a nice flat stick... and I'll put what's left for ya, huh?
I don't know whether I'm doin' right or not.
Get inside! Get inside everybody, and stay inside.
Lady's gonna feed us!
Aw, you're takin'too much.
You men want to work?
Sure, we want to work.
Where's it at? Tavares County.
Fruit's opening' up.
- Need a lot of fruit pickers.
- You doin' the hiring'?
Well, I'm contracting' the land. - What ya paying'?
- Well, can't tell exactly yet.
- About 30 cents, I guess.
- Why can't you tell?
- You took the contract, didn't you?
- That's true. But it's keyed to the price. Might be a little more, might be a little less.
All right, mister.
I'll go.
You just show us your license to contract... then you make out a order... where and when and how much you gonna pay...
- and you sign it, and we'll go.
- Now, listen, smart guy.
I'll run my business my own way. I got work.
If you want to take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.
Twice now, I fell for that line.
Maybe he needs a thousand men.
So he get's 5,000 there, and he'll pay 15 cents an hour.
And you guys'll have to take it, because you'll be hungry.
If he wants to hire men, let him write it out and say what he's gonna pay.
Ask to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contract men without a license.
Hey, Joe.
Ever see this guy before?
Seems like I have.
Seems like I seen him hangin' around that used car lot that was busted into.
Yep, that's the fella.
Get in this car. - You got nothin' on him.
- Open your trap again, and you'll go too.
Now, you fellas don't want to listen to troublemakers.
You better pack up and come on up to Tavares County. Come on, you.
Gimme that gun.
Now get out of here.
Go down in the willows and wait.
- I ain't gonna run. - Why, the-the sheriff, he's seen ya, Tom!
You want to be fingerprinted?
Do you want to get sent back for breakin' parole?
- I guess you're right.
- Hide in the willows.
If it's all right for you to come back, I'll give you four high whistles.
- What's going on here?
- Oh, this man of yours, he got tough, so I hit him.
Then he started shootin'... hit a woman there... so I hit him again.
Well, what did you do in the first place?
I talked back.
This the fella that hit you?
- Well, it looked like him.
- Oh, it was me, all right. You just got smart with the wrong fella.
Get in that car!
This lady's bleeding to death.
Boy, what a mess them.45s make.
Better get the doc.
- Al?
- You can come in now, Tom.
- You got to get out of here right away.
- What's the matter?
Guy down in the willows was tellin' me some of them poolroom fellas... figuring' on burnin' the whole camp out tonight.
We got to get the truck loaded.
Ma?
What you doin' with the jack handle, Ma?
- Oh, she just got sassy, that's all.
- Al was fixin' to run away. Well, we'll sort that out later.
Right now we got to hustle. - Where's Connie?
- Well, Tom, he's gone.
He lit out this evenin'. Said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
Glad to get shed of him.
Never was no good and never will be. - Pa! Shh!
- How come I got to shh?
Run out on us, didn't he? Cut it out, Pa.
Help Al with the truck. Some of the fellas in town are gonna burn out the camp tonight.
Wha...
Aw, don't fret, honey. You'll be all right.
Tom, I just don't feel like nothin' at all.
Without him, I just don't want to live.
Aw, he'll be back.
We'll leave word for him.
Get up there...
Ma. Maybe...
Maybe Connie gone to get some books to study up with.
He gonna be a radio expert, ya know.
Maybe he figured to surprise us.
Maybe that's just what he done.
- Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
- You told me...
- You promised me you wasn't like that, Tom.
I'm a-tryin' to. If it was the law they was workin' with, maybe we could take it.
But it ain't the law! They're workin' away at our spirits.
They're tryin' to make us cringe and crawl...
- workin' on our decency.
- You promised, Tom. I know. I'm a-tryin' to, Ma.
Honest I am. You gotta keep clear.
The family's a-breakin' up. - You've got to keep clear! - What's that, a detour?
Tom don't!
Just where do you think you're goin'?
Well, we're strangers here, mister.
We heard about there was work in a place called Tavares.
Yeah?
Well, you're headin' the wrong way! What's more, we don't want no more Okies in this town!
There ain't enough work here for them that's already here!
- Which way is it at, mister?
- You turn right around and head north.
And don't you come back until the cotton's ready.
Pa, let's try that other tire.
- You got another flat tire, Tom?
- Pa, get that cheviot from back there.
Ma, will you get the hell off there?
It's gonna be heavy enough. All right.
I tell ya, somethin's got to happen soon.
We're down to our last day of grease and... two days of flour and... ten potatoes.
And Rosasharn.
We got to remember, she's gonna be due soon.
- Morning!
- Good morning.
- Morning. You folks lookin' for work?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
- Can you pick peaches?
- We can pick anything. Well, there's plenty of work for you about 40 miles up here, just this side of Pixley.
You turn east on 32. Look for the Keene Ranch.
- Tell 'em Spencer sent you.
- Mister, we sure thank ya!
Yeah.
Thank you. Come on, Ma!
What is it, a wreck?
- Where you think you're going?
- Fella named Spencer sent us.
- Said there was work picking' peaches.
- Oh, you wanna work, huh? - Sure do.
- All right. Just pull up in line there.
Okay for this one!
Take him through!
- What's the matter? - A little trouble up there... but you'll get through all right. What happened?
- Go ahead! - Move it right there.
What do you think it is, a washout?
I don't know what these cops got to do with it, but I don't like it.
And these are our own people too, all of'em.
- I don't like this. - Get goin'.
Go on ahead.
What are ya, tryin' to do, be a scab?
Come on, come on, come on.
Go on.
Up the street there.
Keep in line.
Hold it, bud.
- Want to work?
- Sure, but what is this? None of your business.
Name.
- Joad. - How many men?
- Four.
- Women?
- Two.
- Kids?
- Two. - Can you all work?
- Sure, I guess so. - Okay.
House 63. Wages, five cents a box.
No bruised fruit. Move along. You go to work right away.
Come on, honey.
That's right.
- Name.
- Joad.
- Say, what is all this here?
- Joad?
Not here.
- License?
- Oklahoma.
EL-204. It don't check.
Now, you look here. We don't want no trouble with you.
Just do your own work and mind your business, and you'll be all right.
Sure do want to make you feel at home here, all right.
We gonna live here, Ma?
Why, sure. This won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
I like the tent better.
Why, this is got a floor!
Won't leak when it rains.
Here. This might come in handy.
- Name?
- It's stillJoad.
- How many? - Six.
You all go on. Rosasharn and me will unload the truck.
- Any more of them hamburgers, Ma?
- No, there ain't. - You made a dollar, and that's a dollar's worth.
- Dollar's worth?
That? Well, they charge extra at that company store, and there ain't no other place.
Well, I ain't full.
Well, tomorrow you'll get in a full day's work and a full day's pay.
And then, we'll all have enough.
You wouldn't think just reaching' up and pickin' would get you in the back.
Think I'll walk out and find out what all that fuss outside the gate was.
- Somebody come with me?
- No. I think I'll set awhile then go to bed.
Think I'll look around and see if I can't meet me a girl.
- Girl?
Hey, when I was your age...
- Pa! Thing's been workin' on me, what all that yelling' was about.
- Got me all curious.
- Pick up, Winfield. I'll be back in a little while.
Tom. Now, you be careful.
- Don't you go sticking' your nose in anything.
Where do you think you're goin'?
I thought I'd take a walk. Any law against that?
Well, you can just turn around and walk back.
- You mean I can't even get out of here?
- Not tonight you can't.
Now do you want to walk back... or shall I whistle up some help and have you taken back?
I'll walk back.
- Evenin'.
- Who are you?
- Just goin' past, that's all.
- Know anybody around here? No.
- Casy!
- Well, if it ain't Tom Joad!
Hiya, boy!
I thought you was in jail.
No. They just run me out of town.
Come on in.
Tom Joad.
- Is this the fella you been talkin' about?
- That's him. - What are you doin' here, Tom?
- Workin' pickin' peaches.
I heard some fellas shoutin' when we come in.
I come out to find out what's goin' on.
What's it all about?
- This here's a strike. - Well, five cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
Five cents? They paying' you five cents?
- Sure. We made a buck since midday.
- Lookee, Tom... we come here to work.
They tell us there's gonna be five cents, but there's a whole lot of us... so the man says 21/2 cents.
Well, a fella can't even eat on that, and if he's got kids...
So we says we won't take it, so they drive us off.
Now they're payin' you five cents. But if they bust this strike, you think they'll pay five?
Don't know.
Payin' five now. They'll get 21/2 cents just the minute we're gone.
You know what that is... one ton of peaches picked and carried for a dollar.
That way, you can't even buy enough food to keep you alive.
Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom.
Them peaches is ripe! Two days out and they'll pay us... pay us all five, maybe seven.
No, they won't. They're gettin' five now.
That's all they care about. But the moment they ain't strikebreakin', they won't get no five.
Next thing you know, you'll be out. They got it all fixed down to a T.
Well, soon as the harvest is in, you're a migrant worker.
Afterwards, just a bum.
Five they're gettin' now, that's all they're interested in.
I know exactly what Pa would say. He'd just say it's none of his business.
Guess that's right. He'll have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
Take a beatin'? We was out of food!
Tonight we had meat.
Not much, but we had it. You think Pa's gonna give up his meat on... on account of some other fellas?
Rosasharn needs milk.
You think Ma's gonna starve that baby... just on account of fellas yellin' outside a gate?
Tom, you gotta learn like I'm learnin'.
I don't know it right yet myself, but I'm tryin' to find out.
That's why I can't ever be a preacher again.
Preachers gotta know.
I don't know. I gotta ask.
- I don't like it.
- What's the matter? I can't tell. It seems as though l-I hear somethin'.
Then when I listen, there ain't nothin' to hear.
Well, it ain't out of the question, you know. We're all a little itchy. Cops been tellin' us how they're gonna beat us up.
Not them regular deputies, but them tin-shield men, the ones they got for guards.
They figure I'm the leader 'cause I talk so much.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
Listen. Can't tell whether you hear it or not.
You hear it, Tom? I hear it.
I think it's some guys comin' this way, a lot of'em.
- We got to get out of here.
- Down that way, under the bridge span.!
There he is, The one in the middle.!
The skinny one.!
Listen, you fellas, you don't know what you're doin'!
- You're helpin' to starve kids!
- Ah, shut up, you dirty...
- You've killed him!
Look out!
Boy, he's good and dead. Did you see the fella that done it?
I ain't sure, but I caught him one across the face.
He'll have a trademark he won't be able to get rid of.
- Ma?
- Tom.
Tom. Pa, wake up.
Al, hit the light.
Shh. All right, Ma.
Pick him up. Hurry.
Is he gonna be all right?
- Anybody ask anything?
- No, ma'am.
- You stay by that door.
Tommy.
How does it feel?
Busted my cheek, but I can still see.
- What'd you hear?
- Looks like you done it.
I thought so. It felt like it.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else.
They say they got posses out.
Talkin' about a lynchin' when they catch the fella.
They killed Casy first.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it.
They're sayin' you done it first.
Do they know...
what the fella looks like?
They know he got hit in the face.
I'm sorry, Ma.
I didn't know what I was doin' any more than when you take a breath.
I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
Oh, it's all right, Tommy.
I wished you didn't do it... but you done what you had to do.
And I can't read no fault in you.
I'm goin' away tonight, Ma. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
Tom, there's a whole lot I don't understand... but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.
There was a time we was on the land.
There was a boundary to us then.
Old folks died off and little fellers come.
We was always one thing.
We was the family... kind of whole and clear.
But now we ain't clear no more.
They ain't nothin' that keeps us clear.
Al, he's a-hankerin' and jibbetin' to be off on his own.
UncleJohn's just draggin' around.
Your pa has lost his place. He ain't the head no more.
We're crackin' up, Tom.
They ain't no family now.
And Rosasharn, she's gonna have her baby... but it won't have no family.
I been a-tryin' to keep her goin', but...
And Winfield. What's he gonna be this way?
Growin' up wild. And Ruthie too.
Just like animals.
Got nothing to trust.
Don't go, Tom.
Stay and help.
Help me.
Okay, Ma.
I shouldn't, I know I shouldn't, but okay.
Ma, here come a lot of people.
- How many?
- Ten of us. House 25. The number's on the door.
Okay, mister.
What you payin'?
- 21/2 cents.
- 21/2? - Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
- Take it or leave it.
There are 200 men comin'in from the south that'll be glad to get it.
- But how are we gonna eat? - Look... I didn't set the price.
If you want it, okay. If you don't, turn around and beat it.
- Which way to House 25?
- Straight up the street.
That Casy...
He might have been a preacher, but he seen things clear.
He was like a lantern.
He helped me to see things too.
Comes night, we'll... we'll get out ofhere.
Like a lantern.
- I'll start the car.
All right, Tom.
Jump up, jump up!
It's just till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
Or maybe get trapped in here.
Go get in, Ma.
- Come on, John.
- Hey.!
Where you goin'?
- We're goin' out.
- What for? We got a job offer, a good job.
- Yeah?
Well, let's take a look at you.
- Wasn't there another fella with you?
- You mean that hitchhiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
I guess that's what he looked like.
We just picked him up on the way in.
He left this morning when the rate dropped.
What did you say he looked like again?
Short fella, pale face.
Was he bruised about the face this morning?
I didn't see nothin'.
Okay, go on.
- Goin' out for good?
- Yeah. Goin' north.
Okay.
You done good, Al. You done real good.
- Know where we're goin'?
- Oh, it don't matter. We gotta go and keep a-goin' till we get plenty a-distance away from here.
Ow! Geez!
Hot on the hand.
The fan belt's shot.
Sure picked a nice place for it, too, didn't she?
- Got any gas?
- About half a gallon.
Well, Ma, sure looks like we done her this time.
Lights up ahead. Might be a camp or somethin'.
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll coast her, Al?
- Got to coast it. - Well, let's give her a whirl, huh?
Come on, kids.
Get in. John!
Oh! What was that?
Oh, hurt yourself, John?
- You hit it too fast.
- What's the idea of that?
Well, you see, a lot of children play in here.
You can tell people to drive slow and they're liable to forget.
- But once they hit that hump, they don't forget.
- Got any room here for us? Well, you're lucky.
Howdy do, ma'am.
How are you? - How are you? - How do?
Down that line, turn to the left.
You'll see it. You'll be in number four sanitary unit.
- What's that?
- Mm, toilet, showers, washtubs.
You mean we'll have washtubs with running water?
Yes, ma'am. Camp committee will call on you in the morning, get you fixed.
- Cops? - No.! No cops.
No, people here elect their own cops.
The ladies' committee will call on you, ma'am.
Tell you about the children, the schools and sanitary unit... and who takes care of'em.
Will you come inside and sign up?
Drive around down, Al.
Right this way. In here.
Now, uh, I don't want to seem inquisitive, you understand... but there's certain information I have to have.
Uh, what's your name?
Joad.
Tom Joad.
- J-O...
- A-D.
And how many of you?
Eight... now.
UncleJohn, you don't look so good.
I ain't so good, but I'm comin'.
Shove!
Campsite costs $1.00 a week, but you can work that out... carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean, things like that.
We'll work it out.
Uh, what's the committee you're talkin' about?
We have five sanitary units.
Each one elects a central committeeman.
They make the laws and what they say goes.
You aiming' to tell me... the fellas that are runnin' the camp are just fellas camping' here?
- That's the way it is. - And you say no cops?
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
Oh, I can't hardly believe it.
The camp I was in before, they burned it out... deputies and some of them poolroom fellas.
They don't get in here.
Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially on dance nights.
You got dances too?
We have the best dances in the county, every Saturday night.
- Who runs this place?
- The government.
Well, why ain't they more like it?
You find out.
Well, is anything like work around here?
Well, I can't promise you that.
There'll be a licensed agent here later if you want to talk to him.
- Uh, that cut you have...
- A crate fell on me.
Well, you'd better take care of it.
Store manager will give you something for it.
See you later.
Ma is sure gonna like it here.
She ain't been treated decent for... a long while.
See you later.
- Winfield, Winfield, get up. I got something to show you.
- What's the matter?
It's some white things made out of dish stuff like in the catalogs.
Come on. I'll show you.
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
Here's where you wash your hands.
- What's these?
- Well, I reckon you stand in them little rooms... and water comes down out of that little jigger up there.
- You take a bath. - Oh, look. Just like in the catalog.
Hey, don't you go a-monkeyin'!
Now you done it.
All I done was pull that string.
- Hiya, Mr. Thomas. - Good mornin'.
- How are you?
- Mornin'. Nice job. Listen here.
Maybe I'm gonna talk myself out of my farm, but I like you fellas.
You're good workers. So I'm gonna tell ya.
- You live over in the government camp, don't ya?
- Yes, sir. - And you have dances over there every Saturday night.
- We sure do.
Well, look out next Saturday night.
What's the matter?
I'm head to the central committee over there. I gotta know.
Well, don't tell I told you.
Listen.
"Citizens angered at Red agitators...
"burn another squatters' camp... and order agitators to leave the county."
Listen, what is these Reds anyway?
Every time you turn around, somebody calling' somebody else a Red.
What is these Reds anyway?
Oh, I ain't talkin' about that one way or the other.
All I'm sayin' is that there's going to be a fight at the camp Saturday night... and there'll be deputies ready to go in.
Now go on with your work.
Maybe I've talked myself into trouble... but you're folks like us, and I like you.
- We won't tell who told. Thank you.
- All right.
There ain't gonna be no fight, either.
**
- Mr. And Mrs. Brown. Oh, go right on in, folks.
Go right on in. - Hello there, Jake.
How are you? - Fine, Mr. Jennings. How are you?
Glad to see you. * Swing that lady round and round *
* Swing that pretty girl round and round *
* Swing that girl round and round and round *
* Round and round round and round and round *
*Swing that pretty little girl
*Round and round and round
- Hello.
- Hello.
Gonna dance tonight?
I can waltz. Oh, that's nothin'.
Anybody can waltz. Oh, not like me they can't.
You get goin'. This girl's spoke for. She's gonna be married.
And her man's a-comin' for her, so git!
- Hiya, Bill. - Nice-lookin' gal you got there, huh?
Howdy, Mr. Thomas. Howdy, Mrs. Thomas.
- You're watchin' out, ain't ya?
- Don't you worry. There ain't gonna be no trouble.
I hope you know what you're talkin' about.
Evenin', boys. Who'd you say invited you?
Fella named Jackson. BuckJackson.
Okay. Have a good time.
Thanks.
- Hey, them's our fellas.
- How do you know?
Well... just got a feelin'.
They're kind of scared too.
Follow 'em. Get hold ofJackson, see if he knows 'em.
I'll stay here. Yeah.
- Hello.
- Hello.
So long.
- Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Joad?
- Fine. My, you sure do look pretty.
- Please to dance, ma'am?
- Oh, thank you kindly, but she ain't right well.
- Sort of poorly. - Well, thank you just the same.
How do?
Hey, Jackson, look. Did you ever see them fellas before?
Sorry, neighbor, but, uh, we got to keep the camp clean.
I know one of'em.
I used to work with him. I never asked him to the dance, though.
All right, keep your eye on him. Just keep 'em in sight, that's all.
I seen 'em, Mr. Wallace.
A car with five men parked down by the eucalyptus trees... and another one with four men up on the main road.
And they got guns too!
I seen 'em! Thank you, Willie. You done right good.
You can run along and dance now.
Well, sure looks like the fat's in the fire this time.
What them deputies want to hurt the camp for?
How come they can't let us alone?
We ought to get ourselves some pickax handles and...
No. That's just what they want.
No sirree. If they can get a fight a-goin', they can call in the cops, say we ain't orderly.
- Hey, they're here. We got 'em spotted. - Got everything' ready?
- There ain't gonna be no trouble. - I don't want you to go hurtin' them fellas now.
You don't need to worry. We got everything arranged. Maybe nobody will even see it.
Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
If you gotta sock 'em, sock 'em where they ain't a-gonna bleed.
Gentlemen, hats off, please. Thank you.
*
She's gettin' prettier every day, Ma.
A girl with a baby's always prettier.
- Come on, Ma.
Let's dance. - Oh, Tom, I...
- Go ahead!
- Well, all right.
Tom!
Stop!
* Come and sit by my side if you love me *
* Do not hasten to bid me adieu *
* But remember the Red River Valley *
* And the boy who has loved you so true **
9:29. Let's go!
All right. 9:30. Here we go.
- All right, buddy, I'll dance with her.
- You and who else? Excuse me, Ma.
All right, open up!
We hear you got a riot!
Riot? I don't see any riot.
Who are you?
- Deputy sheriffs. - Well, have you got a warrant?
We don't need a warrant when there's a riot.
Well, I don't know what you're gonna do about it. I don't hear any riot or don't see any riot.
What's more, I don't believe there is any riot. Look for yourself.
*
All right, let's go.
Oklahoma. EL-204.
You have no right to arrest anybody without a warrant, you know.
We'll have a warrant just as soon as we check with headquarters.
Tommy.
Ain't you gonna tell me good-bye?
I didn't know, Ma. I didn't know if I ought to.
- Ma.
- Hush, Ruthie.
Come outside.
There was some cops here tonight.
They was takin' down license numbers.
I guess somebody knows somethin'.
I guess it had to come, sooner or later.
Sit down for a minute.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I'd like to stay, Ma.
I'd like to be with you and see your face... when you and Pa get settled in some nice place.
I'd sure like to see you then... but I won't never get that chance, I guess, now.
- I could hide you, Tommy.
- I know you would, Ma, but I ain't gonna let you.
You hide somebody that's killed a guy and you're in trouble too.
All right, Tommy.
But what do you figure you're gonna do?
You know what I been thinkin' about?
About Casy... about what he said... what he done... about how he died... and I remember all of it.
He was a good man.
I been thinkin' about us too... about our people livin' like pigs... and good, rich land laying' fallow... or maybe one guy with a million acres... and 100,000 farmers starving'.
And I been wonderin' if... all our folks got together and yelled...
Oh, Tommy, they'd drive you out and cut you down just like they done to Casy.
They're gonna drive me, anyways.
Sooner or later they'd get me for one thing if not for another.
Until then...
Tommy, you're not aimin' to kill nobody?
No, Ma, not that. That ain't it.
It's just... well, as long as I'm an outlaw anyways... maybe I can do somethin'.
Maybe I can just find out somethin'... just scrounge around... and maybe find out what it is that's wrong... and then see if there ain't somethin' that can be done about it.
I ain't thought it all out clear, Ma.
L...
I can't. I don't know enough.
Well, how am I gonna know about you, Tommy?
Why, they could kill you and I'd never know.
They could hurt you. How am I gonna know?
Well, maybe it's like Casy says...
Fella ain't got a soul of his own... just a little piece of a big soul... the one big soul that belongs to everybody.
- Then...
- Then what, Tom?
Then it don't matter.
I'll be all around in the dark.
I'll be everywhere, wherever you can look.
Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat...
I'll be there.
Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy...
I'll be there.
I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad.
I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry... and they know supper's ready.
And when the people are eatin' the stuff they raise... and livin' in the houses they build...
I'll be there too.
I don't understand it, Tom.
Oh, me neither, Ma, but... it's just somethin' I been thinkin' about.
Give me your hand, Ma.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Tommy.
Later, when this has blowed over... you'll come back?
Sure, Ma.
Tom, we... we ain't the kissing' kind, but...
Good-bye, Ma.
Good-bye, Tommy.
Tommy.
- Good-bye. - Good-bye.
Be good.
Bye.
Hurry that up now. Get her rolled up.
How you fixed, John?
- Ah, gettin' along fine.
- Here. Here.
Winfield, you get up on top now. Get out of the way.
I don't see what you folks are hurrying' so for. They tell me there's 20 days' work up there.
Yes, sir. And we aim to get in all 20 of them.
- All ready, Ma? - Yes.
How you feelin', Rosasharn?
All aboard, everybody. All aboard for Fresno.
Wait a minute and I'll give you a hand.
- Careful of her now. - Easy, child.
She'll be all right.
- Watch her, John. Take care of her.
- I'll take care of her.
- How you fixed, Al?
- All right, Pa.
Now, Ma.
- Bye. - Good-bye, hon.
Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye! - Good-bye.
- Bye! - Thanks a lot.
- Bye. Bye. - Thanks for everything.
- Be careful now. - Bye.
- Be careful. - Bye.
Be good. Be good.
Twenty days' work. Oh, boy!
I'll be glad to get my hands on some cotton.
That's the kind of pickin' I understand.
Maybe. Maybe 20 days' work and maybe no days' work.
We ain't got it till we get it.
What's the matter, Ma, you gettin' scared?
Scared, huh!
I ain't never gonna be scared no more.
I was, though.
For a while, it looked as though we was beat, good and beat.
Looked like we didn't have nobody in the whole wide world but enemies... like nobody was friendly no more.
Made me feel kind of bad and scared too... like we was lost and nobody cared.
You are the one that keeps us goin', Ma.
I ain't no good no more, and I know it.
Seems like I spend all my time these days thinkin' how it used to be...
- Mm-hmm. - Thinkin' of home.
I ain't never gonna see it no more.
Well, Pa, a woman can change better than a man.
A man lives sorta, well, in jerks.
Baby's born or somebody dies and that's a jerk.
He gets a farm or loses it and that's a jerk.
With a woman, it's all in one flow like a stream... little eddies and waterfalls... but the river, it goes right on.
A woman looks at it that way.
Well, maybe, but we sure taking' a beatin'.
I know. That's what makes us tough.
Rich fellas come up and they die.
Their kids ain't no good and they die out, but we keep a-comin'.
We're the people that live.
They can't wipe us out. They can't lick us.
And we'll go on forever, Pa, 'cause we're the people.
By the end of the World War Tomainia weakened.
Revolution had broken out, her diplomats sued for peace while Tomainia's army fought on, confident its war machine would smash the enemy's lines.
Big Bertha, able to fire 100 miles, was to make its appearance on the Western Front, and strike terror into the enemy.
75 miles away was her target:
the cathedral of Notre-Dame.
Range: 95,452.
Stand clear!
Fire!
Stand by your trigger!
Range correction: 95,455.
Breach secured.
Stand clear.
Ready...
Fire!
Defective shell. We'll examine it.
Check the fuse.
Yes, the fuse.
Look out!
Run!
What's that?
- Air raid. - After Big Bertha.
The anti-aircraft gun!
To the gun!
Have you gone crazy?
Come down!
What do you think you're doing?
Have you gone crazy?
Sir, the enemy have broken through.
Every man to the front.
Muster the gun crew!
Get your hand grenades, soldiers.
Where's your hand grenade?
Give him one.
Keep moving. Come along, hurry up!
Pardon me, but to work this...
Pull the pin, count to ten and throw it!
Let them have it!
This is no time to scratch.
Pull yourself together.
Take this.
Forward!
Fall in!
Hey you, come on!
Order arms!
Prepare to attack.
Forward!
There you are.
The enemy!
Come on, let's get him!
May I come in, sir?
- Who is it?
- Friend.
- What division?
- 21st artillery, sir.
Take this and keep firing.
I'll be back.
Comrade! Help!
What is it?
I'm exhausted.
Quick, help me to my plane.
Thank you. I'll see you get the Tomainian Cross for this.
Only too willing to oblige, sir.
You saved my life. Thank you.
I'll strap you in.
I can't make it alone. You'll have to stay with me.
Can you fly?
I can try.
Lift my hand to the stick. I haven't the strength.
Take charge of that gun!
The enemy!
Quick, lift my hand to the throttle.
We'll fool 'em!
Hold on to these dispatches.
If we get them to General Schmelloffel,
Tomainia may yet win.
I'm going to faint.
Don't say that.
Sorry.
Where am I?
Don't you know me?
Yes, I feel better now.
The blood's returning to my head.
What's below?
The sun?
Shining upwards.
Strange. How's the gas?
Kept me awake all night.
No, the gasoline in the tank!
Almost empty.
We must be nearly there. What time is it?
Approximately one minute to twelve.
Strange.
We seem to be defying the laws of gravity.
Water. Quick, I'm going to faint.
Wait a while.
We'll get into trouble if you faint any more.
Just hold it.
I think I...
Now...
Take it!
Something's wrong.
I can't reach it.
It's all gone.
What's the matter?
Belt too tight.
Loosen it.
I'm trying to!
We're upside down.
I know it!
The stick!
Impossible.
There it goes. We're out of gas.
Well, I suppose this is the end. Cigarette?
Not now!
I shan't need this any more.
What month is it?
April. Spring in Tomainia.
Hilda will be in the garden, tending the daffodils.
How she loves daffodils!
She'd never cut them for fear of hurting them.
It was like taking a life to cut a daffodil.
Sweet, gentle Hilda.
A beautiful soul.
She loved animals, and little children, too.
We've landed!
Dispatches!
Comrade, where are you?
The dispatches...
Where are they?
- Are you hurt?
- Take me to General Schmelloffel.
If we don't deliver these, we're defeated.
- The war's over.
- What?
We lost.
Hynkel takes power.
The Jewish soldier suffered a loss of memory and remained in hospital for years, ignorant of the change in Tomainia.
Hynkel ruled the nation with an iron fist.
Under the double-cross emblem liberty was banished.
Only the voice of Hynkel was heard.
Adenoid Hynkel said,
"Tomainia was down but today has risen."
"Democracy is fragrant."
"Liberty is odious."
"Freedom of speech is objectionable."
"Tomainia has the greatest army."
"The greatest navy."
"But to remain great we must sacrifice."
"We must tighten our belts."
He now speaks to Field Marshal Herring, Minister of War.
Now Herr Garbitsch, Minister of the Interior.
He remembers his early struggles, shared by his two loyal comrades.
A reference to the Jewish people.
The Phooey remarks that for the world he has peace in his heart.
We now pause for station identification.
This is the Pari-Mutual network, bringing you
Hynkel's address to the children of the double-cross.
The interpreter is Hynkel's personal translator, reading from a prepared manuscript.
Stand by for further commentary. Go ahead, Tomainia.
His Excellency is about to descend the stairs.
Your Excellency, are you hurt?
Ride in the other car.
His Excellency seems pleased as he is greeted by Tomainian children.
He pauses before a woman with a child.
Camera!
Even the baby is thrilled and seems all smiles at the attention.
His Excellency leaves the scene and will return along Hynkelstrasse, where he'll pass Tomainia's modern masterpieces:
the Venus of Today and the Thinker of Tomorrow.
- How was it?
- The speech?
Very good.
Your reference to the Jews might have been more violent.
What?
To arouse the people's anger.
Violence against the Jews might make the people forget their stomach.
You're right.
Things have been quiet in the ghetto lately.
Good morning, Mr. Jaeckel.
What's good about it?
Conditions could be worse.
If you think so, you have a great imagination.
You heard Hynkel's speech.
I heard nothing. I've got my own troubles.
You're better off than a lot of people.
What about the barber?
Still in hospital.
He's been there since the war.
Why not rent his barbershop for him?
He won't let me.
Every few weeks he writes to say he's coming back.
A pity it should be idle all these years.
Why worry?
The government will soon take it from him.
Perhaps you're right. Not such a good morning after all.
Now you said it.
Hannah.
On the mantelpiece is my tobacco pouch. Will you get it?
Everyone is full of troubles.
Yeah, everyone. Look at Hannah, poor girl.
A hard worker, can't get a job.
Father was killed in the war, mother died last year.
Can't earn enough to pay her rent.
What can I do?
I can't throw her out.
You need some more.
- Where are you going?
- Mrs. Shoemaker's laundry.
You'd better take the key.
Mrs. Jaeckel and I are going out.
I'm locking up in case the storm troopers start their monkey business again.
Aryan!
We're Aryans!
And we go marching by!
Look, fellows!
Tomatoes and potatoes.
I'll take a box home.
Hey, the lorry.
Hold it there, will you?
You have no right!
Just charge it to my account!
Nice ripe tomatoes.
Why don't some of you do something?
If I were a man I'd show you.
What would you do, pretty?
Not one of you has the guts to stand up alone and fight!
Is the lorry in case someone hits back?
Shut up!
Come and take me. You'll get medals for it.
You pick on women and rob defenceless people.
Don't rob the poor girl, boys. Give her back her tomatoes.
I'll have to do it again.
Pigs!
- Patient 33!
- Yes, sir.
An interesting case: amnesia.
Jewish soldier. Been here since the war.
He thinks it's only been weeks.
Does he knows what's happened?
No.
His one interest seems to be in his barbershop, which he believes he left a few weeks ago.
He'll have many surprises.
I'm afraid so.
- Yes?
- Number 33 is gone.
He was to be examined.
But he's disappeared.
Disappeared?
Let him go. It isn't a serious case.
There's little we can do for him.
Come on, get out of here!
What are you doing?
I don't know.
Leave that alone.
- Don't be silly.
- I'm not silly!
I appreciate that.
When you talk to me, "Hail Hynkel"!
Who are you?
I'll show you who I am! Come down to headquarters!
That's my shop.
I don't care if it is or not.
Going to put up a fight, are you?
Come to headquarters.
Let me tell you something.
Policeman?
Arrest that man for assault.
- Come here, you!
- Leave me alone.
Attacking a storm trooper!
You'll hear from my lawyer.
He bit my finger!
Sorry, I didn't mean to hit you.
I enjoyed that.
But you'd better beat it.
- I'll call a policeman.
- No!
- Why not?
- Are you crazy?
More are coming!
- More what?
- Wait!
Come in here.
What's wrong with you?
Don't be foolhardy.
What's this?
Who hit you?
I think it was a gang.
You'd better get fixed up.
We'll investigate later.
What time is it?
All right, they've gone.
Thanks, mister.
That did me a lot of good.
You've sure got some nerve.
We should all fight back.
We can't fight alone, but we can lick 'em together.
We didn't do so bad.
You're the barber, who was in hospital!
Mr. Jaeckel has talked about you.
We didn't think you'd come back.
The storm troopers will be after you.
You'd better hide. I'll get the key to the cellar.
- Is this the man?
- That's him.
Hail Hynkel!
Who's he?
Don't fool with me.
Hail Hynkel!
Your hands.
Just a moment.
Not here.
Bring him outside.
First you'll finish this.
Here.
Go on, paint that!
Wait a minute, boys.
I've got a bright idea.
Commander Schultz!
First in command.
Second in command.
Oh, never mind. You!
Who told you to hang people from lampposts?
What was the trouble?
A Jew attacking storm troopers.
- Where is he?
- There.
Break ranks.
So there you are.
Stand him up.
Get up.
You?
Don't you remember me?
- You saved my life.
- Me?
Strange.
And I always thought of you as an Aryan.
I'm a vegetarian.
Don't you remember?
We got away in my plane.
Plane?
Then we crashed.
Now I remember.
Well, how are you?
What's my friend done?
He resisted my men painting his windows.
Any brave man would resist.
I'm sorry for this.
No harm.
In future you will not be molested again.
If you or your friends ever need help...
Who did that?
One of my friends.
Hynkel's palace was the centre of the world's greatest war machine.
Behind it was the dynamic Adenoid Hynkel, whose genius ran the nation, whose ceaseless activity kept him occupied every moment of the day.
Marshal Herring is waiting.
Enough!
I believe we've got something now.
A bulletproof uniform. The material is as light as silk.
Where?
I've arranged for a demonstration. It will only take two minutes.
I can spare one.
Professor Herr Kibitzen.
Actions speak louder than words.
A bulletproof uniform.
One hundred percent perfect.
Shoot!
Far from perfect.
- Where's my secretary?
- In the outer office.
Call her.
Take a letter.
Herring here in the tower room.
We've got something marvellous.
I shall be up.
A parachute. The most compact in the world.
Worn like a hat.
It will open in 25 feet.
Demonstrate, professor.
Herring, why do you waste my time like this?
Send Garbitsch here.
Herr Garbitsch is waiting.
Enough!
What's the meaning of this?
25 million for prison camps?
We need to manufacture munitions.
- We've made a few arrests.
- How many?
Five or ten thousand... a day.
- A day?
- Just a few dissenters.
Dissenting about?
Working hours, wage cuts, the synthetic food, the quality of the sawdust in the bread.
What more do they want? It's from the finest lumber!
Nevertheless, the people are overworked.
They need diversion.
The people, bah!
We might go further with the Jews.
Burn some of their houses.
An assault on the ghetto.
Something more dramatic.
When can we be ready to invade Osterlich?
Three months.
I can't wait.
Napaloni's army might invade first.
We must strike now.
We'll require foreign capital.
Borrow it!
The bankers have refused.
One man might make us a loan:
Epstein.
- Epstein?
He's a Jew, isn't he?
- Yes.
Well, let's be big about it.
We'll borrow from Epstein.
It might be difficult in view of our policy towards his people.
Then we'll change our policy.
Tell Schultz all persecution of the Jews must cease.
At least till we've negotiated this loan.
I don't understand it. The whole ghetto is so quiet.
You can't imagine what was going on.
This Hynkel business.
You weren't here, you were in the hospital, unconscious.
You don't appreciate what a good time you were having.
If things get worse we can go to Osterlich.
That's still free.
Sooner or later we'll have to go.
Anyway, it's nice to see you back.
It's like the old days again, eh?
How's business?
Very slow.
The men are in concentration camp.
You should fix up the women.
The beauty parlour business.
Know anything about it?
You can learn. You can practise on Hannah.
Hannah, get in that chair, we'll make you look beautiful.
What for?
He's going to practise on you.
Not with mud on my face?
No, we'll take some off.
Make me look beautiful?
Sure. He can't make you look any worse!
Mrs. Shoemaker's laundry!
I'll give it to her. You sit here and enjoy yourself.
I know. I've seen you making eyes.
Don't pay any attention to him.
I like your shop since it's fixed up.
I wish I had a business like this. There's no future in housework.
Maybe if I save my money I can have a barbershop some day.
But I can never save. Money slips through my fingers.
I've always lived up to every penny I've earned.
Why shouldn't I?
You're here today and gone tomorrow.
Do you believe in God?
I do.
But if there wasn't one, would you live any different?
I wouldn't.
Life could be wonderful if people'd leave you alone.
Things are looking brighter now.
Maybe because of you saving Schultz.
Funny how they've left us alone.
Too good to be true.
Do you ever daydream?
That's the only time I'm really happy: dreaming.
Sometimes I get so carried away I don't know what I'm doing.
Aren't you like that?
We're very much alike.
- Both absent-minded.
- You think so?
I like absent-minded people.
Like the man who put his watch in boiling water and held the egg!
All great men are absent-minded.
It's a sign you're smart.
My folks didn't think so.
You have an excuse. You were injured in the war.
I was born that way.
I wonder why women never grow whiskers.
Isn't that foolish of me?
I could kick myself in the shins, I could...
I'll give you a shampoo.
Ain't I cute?
How did you do it?
You should try it on yourself.
Fixed up, you'd look handsome.
Four pecks a pound, new potatoes!
The potato man!
I have to go.
Take it easy there.
Did you hurt yourself?
- Careful next time.
- Here's another one.
How do you do?
Something's happened.
The storm troopers helped me up.
How wonderful if they stopped hating us, if they let us go about our business like we used to.
How wonderful if we didn't have to go to another country.
I don't want to go.
With all the persecution, I still love it here.
Perhaps we don't have to go.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if they'd let us live and be happy again?
Full stop.
Nothing works!
Not even a sharp pencil.
I'm surrounded by incompetent, stupid, sterile stenographers.
I'll get you a pen.
Don't bother!
I won't send it.
Get out, get out!
We've just discovered the most wonderful poison gas.
It will kill everybody...
All right.
Later.
B76 to see Herr Herring.
A lady.
My secret agent.
Your secret agent?
Tell her to come here.
Have B76 come right in.
Any news from Epstein?
Our agent reports that all the board of directors are Aryans.
- The loan's bound to go through.
A strike at the arms factory.
- The leader?
- Five of them.
- Have them shot.
- They were.
How many were going to strike?
Three thousand of them.
Have them all shot.
I don't want dissatisfied workers.
These men are skilled craftsmen.
Let's train others first, then shoot them!
Cannot afford to be lenient.
The rhythm of production will be affected.
Rhythm...
All right, have your rhythm.
Spare the strikers and permit them to return to work.
But mark them for future reference.
That's my department. I'll attend to that. This way.
The strike leaders are all brunettes. Not one blond.
Troublemakers! Worse than Jews.
- Then wipe them out!
- "Doucement".
We'll get rid of the Jews first, then concentrate on the brunettes.
We shall never have peace till we have a pure Aryan race.
How wonderful!
Tomainia, a nation of blue-eyed blonds.
Why not a blond Europe, Asia, America?
- And a brunette dictator.
- Of the world!
Why not?
Aut Caesar aut nullus. The world's effete, worn out, afraid.
No nation would dare oppose you.
Dictator of the World!
It's your destiny.
We'll kill off the Jews, wipe out the brunettes, then will come forth a pure Aryan race.
Beautiful blond Aryans.
They will love you, they will worship you as a god.
No, you mustn't say it.
You make me afraid of myself.
Dictator of the World!
We'll invade Osterlich first. After that we can bluff.
The nations will capitulate.
The world will be under your thumb.
Leave me!
I want to be alone.
Aut Caesar aut nullus.
Emperor of the World!
My world.
The happy hour programme.
Work with the rhythm of music.
Our next selection:
Brahms' Hungarian Dance number five.
Fifteen cents, please.
Happy hour signing off.
At six, Adenoid Hynkel will address the children of the double-cross.
It seems like the old days again.
How long is it going to last?
In the papers it's rumoured that Hynkel's going to give the Jews back their rights.
Maybe.
What do you want?
Business is much better.
Nobody interferes with us any more.
Doesn't that make you feel good?
The trouble, Mr. Jaeckel, is you're so used to bad times, you're unhappy without them.
Get my Sunday shoes.
They're on the windowsill.
I can't find the shawl.
I've got a shawl.
What's going on?
They're dressing Hannah up to go out.
Is that so?
She's got a beau.
- Who is it?
- The barber.
Now, turn around.
- My dear! Those hands!
- What's the matter with them?
Those calluses.
They're so rough.
Maybe I better not go.
Don't be foolish.
He knows you do housework.
Wait!
I'll get a pair of mittens.
See if he's ready.
Not yet.
He's polishing a bald man's head.
Bad news.
The invasion of Osterlich will have to be delayed.
- What?
- Epstein refuses to lend the money.
Epstein refuses, eh?
Send for Schultz.
Epstein refuses.
What did he say?
He complained of the persecution and said he wouldn't have any dealings with a mediaeval maniac.
He'll deal with a mediaeval maniac more than he thinks!
First I shall deal with his people.
- Your Excellency?
- Call out the storm troopers.
A little mediaeval entertainment in the ghetto!
At such a time I think it ill-advised.
Such demonstrations demoralise the country.
Indeed?
Since when do you care about the ghetto?
I speak in the interests of our party and the cause of humanity.
You need a holiday.
Fresh air.
A little outdoor exercise.
I'll send you to a concentration camp.
Place Schultz under arrest.
Very well, but remember my words.
Your cause is doomed to failure because it is built on the stupid persecution of innocent people.
Your policy is worse than a crime.
It's a tragic blunder.
Traitor!
Traitor!
You're a double-dyed democrat!
Schultz, why have you forsaken me?
Excellency, here are the notes for your speech.
I'll not need them.
What I say will not be directed to the children of the double-cross but to the children of Israel!
That Hynkel isn't such a bad fellow after all.
Most amusing.
Get a Hynkel badge!
A Hynkel badge!
A fine photo on each!
- We'd better go home.
- Yeah.
Let's hurry.
Wait a minute.
What's that?
Turn off the radio.
The storm troopers!
- Bar that door!
- Get some water!
Get the women and children upstairs. Lock all the doors.
You men, stay right here.
We've got to make a stand.
We might as well die as live like this.
Wait a minute. We have a social call to make here.
Wait a minute!
Schultz gave strict orders not to molest anyone in this court.
These Jews attacked us.
I don't care.
Orders were to keep out.
You saw that!
I can't help it.
Schultz's orders.
Let's get going.
Orders or not, I'm going to get that girl.
Out!
Schultz arrested!
Hear that?
He's arrested Commander Schultz.
- A Jew corrupted our commander.
- Let's kill the louse!
Schultz is accused of treason, and you know why.
Schultz was a friend of that barber.
Let's get the barber!
We want the barber!
It's the storm troopers!
- Get on the roof.
- No.
- They'll kill you!
- I'll fight.
Don't be a fool, you'll be murdered.
Get on the roof.
All right, here we are.
Smash in the door!
Come on, we'll give the barber a haircut!
Where are the bombs?
There goes the barbershop!
Never mind.
We can start again.
We can go to Osterlich. That's still free.
Mr. Jaeckel says it's beautiful.
Wonderful green fields, and they grow apples and grapes.
His brother's got a vineyard.
Mr. Jaeckel said he'd take me with him.
Now we can all go together.
It'll be wonderful living in the country, much better than a smoky old city.
And if we work hard and don't eat much, we can save money and buy a chicken farm.
There's money to be made in chickens.
Look at that star!
Isn't it beautiful!
Hynkel with all his power can never touch that.
All right, the coast is clear.
Commander Schultz escaped.
He's hiding in my cellar.
He's holding a meeting at midnight and he wants you to be there.
Hannah, you come and help Mrs. Jaeckel with the supper.
All right, I'll be down.
I don't understand it. This crazy midnight supper...
What does this Schultz want of us?
- He wants us to blow up the palace.
We Jewish people shouldn't get mixed up in such a business.
I know it but Schultz has them all hypnotised.
- I knew he was up to some mischief.
- Sure he is.
I found him putting a coin in one of your puddings.
Don't worry, I've fixed everything. Wait and see.
Gentlemen, may I claim your indulgence for a moment?
We are here tonight to rid the country of a tyrant.
In order to carry this out one of us must die.
In ancient times the Aryan tribe of the Langobardians made human sacrifice to the god Thor.
At a feast by lottery the victim was chosen.
Tonight, at this feast, one of you will be chosen.
Each man will receive a pudding.
Concealed in one of these is a coin.
Whoever gets it must give up his life but he will join the long line of history's noble martyrs and will rid his country of a tyrant.
I know that it is the wish of all of us to be chosen this night to die for Tomainia.
Much as I should like to participate in this ordeal, I cannot...
Why?
Don't you understand?
He's too well known.
It must be somebody like us.
I can't see it like that.
It is a question of my honour.
It is very embarrassing.
Commander Schultz, I apologise for my friend.
Let me say, on behalf of myself and the others, that we consider it a great privilege to die for our country.
Very well, then.
Gentlemen, I shall now retire until fate has chosen the liberator.
Until then...
Hail Hynk...
What am I saying?
Gentlemen, we have pledged our honour.
Proceed!
Gentlemen, the coin is here!
What's the meaning of this?
Somebody made a fool of us.
- I did.
- What?
I put a coin in every pudding.
Blowing up palaces and wanting to kill people!
We're in enough trouble!
Hannah's right. We've all been foolish.
Our place is at home, looking after our own affairs.
The papers say Schultz may be in the ghetto.
Here, read it for yourself.
Hannah, read that.
"Mystery surrounds the disappearance of ex-Commander Schultz.
"At police HQ it was believed he may be hiding in the ghetto.
"A certain Jewish barber, reported to be a friend of Schultz,
"is wanted for questioning."
Me?
Only for questioning. Not too serious.
Meyerberg was only wanted for questioning. We never saw him again.
- Who is it?
- It's me, Mr. Mann.
Did you hear what they're saying about Schultz hiding in the ghetto?
I know, I know.
Don't you think it's serious if they find him in the house?
Don't you realise there are spies everywhere!
Spies?
What's the matter?
He's wanted for questioning.
Where's the Commander?
In the next room.
If Commander Schultz is found in this house, we'll all go to a concentration camp and have our heads cut off, too!
Am I arguing?
Then get rid of him.
You can't throw him out.
Of course not.
But I'd like to know how long he's going to stay here.
Your breakfast is on the table.
Thank you. I have breakfast waiting at home.
Search every house.
- What now?
- They're looking for Schultz.
He's in one of these houses.
They're always looking for somebody.
It's me.
Let me in.
The storm troopers are searching every house.
Tell the Commander.
- Did you tell him?
- What is it?
- The storm troopers.
- What?
- You'd both better get on the roof.
We can't leave all these things.
All of you, pack my cases.
You pack that.
Clear this shelf.
Pack this and this.
This mustn't be found.
Open the door.
They're here!
Get up on the roof.
Nothing left behind!
- My golf clubs!
- The hatbox!
- Take this.
- Come on, let's hurry!
- Where are you going?
- With him.
You'll see him later.
- I'll meet you tonight.
- All right.
Take this.
Quick!
Open in the name of Hynkel!
Stop!
Look where you are!
I can't see, wait a moment.
My bag!
It's right here.
Here it is.
Don't drop the other one.
My golf clubs, not my golf clubs!
Come here.
They'll see you.
Quick, this way!
Woah, steady!
- Now be careful.
- Yes, sir.
Lucky you didn't break your neck.
You'll pardon me.
I'm sorry.
You guard the back.
Wait a minute!
I'll have to bother you again.
There he is.
How are you?
So-so.
Here's your friend.
Your silence will be appreciated.
Take him to the wagon.
Where are you going?
Smoking room.
Come on, this way!
Osterlich!
I am pleased to announce that we are at last ready to march on Osterlich.
This was made possible by the genius of Field Marshal Herring, upon whom I shall now pin a token of my regard.
Turn around.
Gentlemen.
To Field Marshal Herring!
To the invasion of Osterlich!
Elephant!
Wait.
Napaloni's army is on the Osterlich front.
60,000 men are on the border.
To take Osterlich!
I can't believe it.
You can't believe it!
You let him steal a march on us.
I had the ground covered.
Declare war on Napaloni!
Mobilise every division of the army and air force.
Attack Bacteria at once!
- But...
- Do as I tell you!
- Madness.
- Shut up!
Will you sign this?
What is it?
A declaration of war.
Yes.
A pen!
I'll sign it.
A pen!
I'll sign it!
Napaloni...
- It's Napaloni.
- Wait a minute.
Napaloni?
You talk to him.
What'll I say?
Be nice, affable, pleasant.
Well, well, how are you?
No, he hasn't been playing much.
His Excellency?
Just now he's a little hoarse.
No, I mean he can't talk.
May I take a message?
He says no doubt you've heard about Osterlich.
He wants to discuss it.
Ask him to come here.
His Excellency invites you to Tomainia to discuss the matter.
Very well.
I'll make the arrangements.
He's coming.
Good.
We'll put on the greatest military show the world has ever known.
Napaloni will leave the invasion of Osterlich to me.
And this?
- What is it?
- Your declaration of war.
Peace is declared!
2,975,000 eager citizens are massed in the station square awaiting Benzino Napaloni.
Entering the station is our Phooey, ready to greet his guest.
This will cement the friendship between our Phooey and the Dictator of Bacteria.
His Excellency is about to greet the Bacterian ambassador.
How do you do?
Garbitsch...
See about the photography.
Tell the press to see that our Phooey is well photographed.
- Not the back of his head!
- Yes, sir.
Napaloni's train is coming into the station.
From a pink and white carriage
Napaloni and his wife will step out and Adenoid Hynkel will deliver his address of welcome.
What's all this mix-up-a?
They've gone too far.
At ease!
Bring the carpet.
Why can't -a we get out here?
No-a carpet.
Who cares?
Me, Napaloni, I never get out without a carpet.
Lay it down here.
Quick.
- It's going back.
- What?
Let's get out while it's stopping.
Shut up!
Take it away!
Stay here until they've made up their minds.
You got-a da carpet.
Put it down!
Here he is.
- My friend!
- Napaloni!
This is indeed a pleasure.
Welcome to Tomainia.
This way.
Pictures!
Sure.
Salute!
Another, please.
This is a pleasure, my friend Hynkel.
You want another?
There.
Where's -a my ambassador?
Hello, Spook.
How do you feel?
Look after mamma.
Hynky, did you meet-a my wife?
That's her.
Let's go.
Tomainia... very nice, very nice.
Your clock is-a slow.
This way.
It's -a very nice people.
The people are very nice.
Thank you.
He's my husband!
You make a mistake!
You make a big-a mistake!
Napaloni's army shall not invade Osterlich.
It belongs to me!
We shall not discuss the Osterlich situation.
This interview is to impress on him the force of your personality.
To make him feel your superiority.
Napaloni is aggressive, domineering.
We must put him in his place.
But how?
By means of psychology.
By making him feel inferior.
This can be done subtly.
For instance,
I have arranged that he'll be looking up at you, you looking down at him.
His position will be inferior.
Then again we shall seat him here beside your bust so that if you relax that will always be glaring at him.
Where is he now?
Resting.
I have arranged that he will enter from the far end of the room.
Another psychological triumph.
He will have the embarrassment of walking the entire floor.
Signor Napaloni is now leaving his room.
He's coming.
Quick, give me a flower.
At all times be above him, before him.
Entering or leaving you must be first.
Hello, Hynky!
How are you feel?
My brother dictate!
You're a nice-a little man.
I'm so glad to see you again.
And my friend the Garbitsch!
This is a lovely place.
I feel-a fine.
I just had a nice cold shower.
When you have the plumbing fixed it'll be in good shape.
Won't you sit down?
Well, Hynky, my dictator friend, you.
I must be a-growing!
What do they give me?
A baby stool?
This is not for me.
I like it better upstairs.
Garbitsch, this is a lovely country.
Very nice-a people.
I thought the public enthusiastic.
Sure.
They like to see new faces.
I'm sorry for the mishap that occurred to Madam Napaloni.
What's that?
I'm sorry for the Napaloni that occurred at the... at...
Madam Napaloni at the station.
She's not used to public life.
She can't take it.
Match.
I'm sorry...
Don't apologise. I find-a one.
I'm simply crazy about this palace.
Ivory and gold.
A lovely combination.
Gets away from that gingerbread idea.
Tell me something, Garbitsch, what's on the programme?
The grand ball this evening.
And a review of the army.
That won't take-a long!
I'm afraid it will.
So you got a big army, huh?
Modesty forbids.
Seems I've heard about it.
I think I'll get me a shave.
We have a barbershop.
Is that so?
You look blue under the gills.
What do you say we go together?
- Delighted.
- Good!
Very well, this way.
This is it.
I can-a smell 'em.
This is-a very sweet.
It was the library.
A good barbershop.
- Too old-fashioned.
- Is that so?
When I get shaved I like something to look at.
So I'm putting in glass walls.
This way, I shall have a view of the mountains.
And this, a view through the glass ceiling.
- What's above?
- The ballroom.
In my summer palace I have a barbershop.
Is that so?
Also with glass walls.
You don't tell me!
With goldfish inside.
Goldfish swimming inside the walls?
How do you feed them?
You can't, they're all dead.
That's why I'm building a new one.
- Very interesting!
- You like it?
The Hynkel stadium.
Before half a million spectators the greatest ever display of arms marches by in review.
Our beloved Phooey and I'll-Dig-a-Ditchy are seated, thrilled by this historic event.
What?
Nothing.
I'm just chewing.
Some peanuts?
- I've had some.
- Good shape.
Here you are, Spook.
Now passing, Tomainia's heavy artillery.
It's all right.
I want to show you my new bombing planes.
They're coming over.
- Where from?
- Aroma.
Aroma?
That's 400 miles away.
Right.
I don't know what's detaining them.
Now passing, Tomainia's light artillery.
Very light!
And here come the armoured tanks, the pride of Tomainia's army.
The latest design, the last word in modern warfare.
Where's the propellers?
For going under the water!
Under water?
You never heard of tanks that go under the water and fly up-a stairs?
- What's that?
- Under the water and in the air.
Obsolete now!
We're concentrating on flying dreadnoughts.
- What's that?
- My planes!
Now passing, Hynkel's flying division number 34.
Our planes!
You're right.
They're yours.
Garbitsch!
The invasion of Osterlich.
Our troops, tanks and guns will be hidden along the border.
To disarm suspicion, you will go hunting.
Then you will show up at Pretzelburg, meet the army, step into a car and cross over into Osterlich.
Herring and I will be waiting at the capital.
First Napaloni must remove his troops.
To be decided tonight.
Where is Napaloni?
I'll look for him.
It might be advisable for you to dance with Madam Napaloni.
It'll carry weight.
You mean I will!
You find him! And let me know at once.
- Madam Napaloni...
- Your Excellency!
Why so triste?
Because I no speak.
No?
May I have the pleasure?
Allow me.
Madam, your dancing was superb.
Excellent.
Very good.
Good.
- My dear Adenoid.
- Benzino!
I've been looking for you.
Let's go to some quiet place where we can talk-a things over.
- As you wish.
- An excellent idea.
To the buffet!
Of course, this way.
There's a Tomainian proverb...
Funny.
I wish I understand it.
Now about the border.
Yes.
No problem.
It should be no trouble.
- What's the matter?
- Wait.
You, too. Out!
Out.
- So... the border question.
- Yes.
It's just a matter of detail.
Formalities.
Strawberries!
- Have you any English mustard?
- English mustard.
- That's da hot-a stuff?
- Very hot.
Good shape.
Cream.
Hynky, I'm going to make this very simple.
You agree not to invade Osterlich,
I agree not to invade Osterlich.
We sign, then I remove my troops from the border.
When your troops are gone, I sign.
That's -a right.
Just a minute, you don't understand.
First we sign, then I remove-a da troops.
- Precisely.
I sign after.
- Just a minute.
Hey, Spook, treaty.
Hold-a dis.
Now, look, you sign-a dis treaty first.
Then I remove my troops after.
Why are we arguing?
You said I remove first.
I can't sign while they're there.
- I won't remove them till you sign.
- Why not?
- Why should I?
- Osterlich is a free country!
Your soldiers are there.
And they'll stay until you sign.
I'll blow them off.
This won't get us anywhere.
To quote an old Latin phrase...
Strawberries!
Where's -a my sandwich?
Another one!
I don't get this treatment in my own joint!
Can't we discuss this without passion?
I'm not-a passionate.
I'm just...
I want him to sign the treaty.
What would my people think, signing such a treaty when your soldiers are on the border?
I won't move until you sign!
Not until you clear the border will I sign!
Then they remain.
Then I kick them off.
One move from you and my artillery will blow you to pieces!
And my aeroplanes will bomb your artillery like that!
You want-a start a world war?
You and the world I'll throw in the ocean!
Strawberries!
Your Excellency, we have...
I got-a my guns here in the pass and I'll blow him to pieces.
What's the matter?
What ails you?
This isn't like you.
Hey, Garbitsch, come here.
What's with Hynky?
Mustard on his strawberries.
What else can you expect from Hynky?
My little bambino!
The Bacterian...
Tomainia...
You cannot treat Bacteria this way.
I'll take the Bacterian people and tear them apart, like this!
Look what he's doing!
It's an insult to my people!
He's -a tearing spaghetti!
He sign-a the treaty or we have a war!
Give me a-something!
Quick, give me a-something!
- I have an appointment.
- What's this?
Press.
How's the conference progressing?
Very successfully.
How did you get in?
How did he get here?
You know the regulations about reporters.
No one is to enter the palace under any circumstances, understand?
There are minor details to be cleaned up...
Excuse me, we're busy.
The whole world will know we're fighting!
- So what?
- Can't we come to an agreement?
When he signs.
I sign nothing.
I must speak to you alone.
Do you mind?
Mind?
I don't mind!
Sign!
Sign!
He'll have the advantage.
It's a mere scrap of paper.
When his troops are off the border, we can move in.
I'll sign.
What?
Hold-a this.
Ah, my little Hynky!
My dictator brother!
I knew we have-a no trouble.
Two prisoners escaped in officers' uniforms.
Sound the alarm!
Two prisoners escaped.
The planes are searching for us.
The woods.
No, the open.
The border's that way.
The invasion of Osterlich.
Now or never.
Ducks.
Did you hear that?
It came from over there.
A yodeller.
Where did you get that outfit?
- What?
- Don't answer back!
Where's Schultz?
You won't talk, eh?
- He will when we get him to camp.
- Come on.
There it is.
The village of Pretzelburg.
If we can pass through there we're safe.
Through the woods?
They're swarming with soldiers.
They'd suspect us at once.
If you see anyone, don't look right or left.
We must bluff our way through.
Here they come.
Can you see what they're doing?
- Looking this way.
- Keep going!
They're following us.
Shall we run?
Certainly not.
Just a little bit?
Keep walking!
We could walk faster.
Make up your mind.
Slow down?
- No!
- There's no hurry.
He's here!
Sound assembly!
Attention!
Present arms!
Turn back?
No, keep going!
Hail Hynkel!
Your Excellency, everything is under control.
- Good.
- Good.
I have been in communication with Marshal Herring in Osterlich.
The route is well guarded.
Behind us are 200 tanks, 50 armoured cars and 500 machine-guns.
- Good.
- Good.
Are we ready to start?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Gentlemen.
Schultz, I'm happy you're with us again.
Thank you.
Where are we going?
You're invading Osterlich.
They're coming.
Your Excellency.
The world awaits your words.
What's happened?
He looks strange.
What's Schultz doing here?
Pardoned, I suppose.
His Excellency Herr Garbitsch,
Secretary of the Interior, Minister of Propaganda...
Corona veniet delectis.
Victory shall come to the worthy.
Today, democracy, liberty and equality are words to fool the people.
No nation can progress with such ideas.
They stand in the way of action.
Therefore, we abolish them.
In the future, each man will serve the state with absolute obedience.
Let him who refuses beware!
Citizenship will be taken away from all Jews and non-Aryans.
They are inferior and therefore enemies of the state.
It is the duty of all true Aryans to hate and despise them.
This nation is annexed to the Tomainian Empire, and the people will obey the laws bestowed on us by our great leader,
the Dictator of Tomainia, the conqueror of Osterlich, the future Emperor of the World!
You must speak.
I can't.
You must.
It's our only hope.
Hope...
I'm sorry but I don't want to be an emperor.
That's not my business.
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.
I should like to help everyone:
Jew, gentile, black man, white.
We all want to help one another.
Human beings are like that.
We want to live by each other's happiness, not misery.
We don't want to hate one another.
In this world, the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.
The way of life can be free and beautiful but we have lost the way.
Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into bloodshed.
We have developed speed but have shut ourselves in.
Machinery has left us in want.
Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness, hard and unkind.
We think too much and feel too little.
More than machinery we need humanity.
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.
Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost...
The aeroplane and radio have brought us closer.
These inventions cry out for the goodness in man, cry out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all.
Even now my voice is reaching millions, millions of despairing men, women and children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.
To those who can hear me I say, do not despair.
The misery upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took will return to the people.
So long as men die liberty will never perish.
Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you, regiment your lives, tell you what to think and feel, who drill you, treat you like cattle and use you as cannon fodder.
Don't give yourselves to these men, machine men with machine minds and machine hearts.
You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men!
You have the love of humanity in you.
Don't hate.
Only the unloved and the unnatural hate.
Soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty!
St. Luke says, "The Kingdom of God is within man."
Not in one man nor a group of men, but in all men.
In you!
You have the power to create machines, the power to create happiness.
You have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.
In the name of democracy, let us use that power.
Let us all unite, let us fight for a new world, a world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age security.
Promising these things, brutes have risen.
But they lie!
They do not fulfil that promise.
They never will!
Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people.
Now let us fight to fulfil that promise!
Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.
Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to the happiness of all.
Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us unite!
Hannah, can you hear me?
Wherever you are, look up, Hannah.
The clouds are lifting, the sun is breaking through.
We are coming out of the darkness into a new world, a kindlier world, where men will rise above their hate, their greed and their brutality.
Look up, Hannah.
The soul of man has been given wings.
He is flying into the rainbow, into the light of hope, into the future, the glorious future that belongs to you, to me and to all of us.
Look up, Hannah.
Look up!
Did you hear that?
Listen...
Copy boy!
- Make it snappy.
- Where's the rest of this story?
Morning Post.
City desk?
Just a moment.
If anybody asks, I'm at the courthouse.
- Elevator!
- Going down.
- Hello, Hildy.
- Hi, Skinny.
Hello, Ruth, Maisie.
- Is the lord of the universe in?
- Yes, in a bad humour.
Somebody stole the crown jewels.
- Shall we announce you?
- I'll blow my own horn.
Bruce, wait. I'll be back in ten.
Ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
What did you say?
Go on.
Well, go ahead.
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
I like it. That's why I asked you to say it again.
I like being spoiled. The man I'm going to see did very little of it.
I'd like to spoil him. Want me to go with you?
- I can handle it.
- Lf it gets rough, I'm here.
I'll come running, partner.
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello, Hildy!
- How are you?
- Welcome back.
Hello, Hildy, how have you been?
Beatrice, how's "Advice to the Lovelorn"?
- Fine. My cat had kittens again.
- Your fault.
Glad to see you. Hi, Jim.
Mildred, you still around?
A little more around the chin, boss.
- What do you want?
- Your ex-wife is here.
Hello, Hildy.
- Hello, Walter. - Hi.
Hi, Louie. How's the slot-machine king?
I ain't doing that no more. I'm retired. Know what I mean?
- Walter.
- I'm busy!
The governor didn't sign that reprieve.
Tomorrow, Earl Williams dies and makes a sucker out of us.
What are you gonna do?
- Phone the governor.
- I can't.
- Why not?
- He's out fishing.
- How many places to fish are there?
- Two. Atlantic and Pacific.
That simplifies it.
- Get him.
- And say what?
Quiet, Duffy. He's thinking.
If he reprieves Williams, we'll support him for senator.
Tell him the Morning Post will back him.
- You can't.
- Why?
We're a democratic paper.
After we get the reprieve, we'll be democratic again.
Get going. The Morning Post expects every editor to do his duty.
You too, Louie. Get out of here.
Walter, I see you're still at it.
First time I cheated a governor. What can I do for you?
Would you mind if I sat down?
There's a lamp burning in the window for you. Here.
I jumped out of that window a long time ago, Walter.
May I have one of those?
Thank you.
And a match?
Thank you.
- How long is it?
- How long is what?
You know what.
How long is it since we've seen each other?
Well, let's see.
I spent six weeks in Reno, then Bermuda. About four months.
Seems like yesterday.
Maybe it was yesterday, Hildy. Been seeing me in your dreams?
Mama doesn't dream about you. You wouldn't know her now.
Yes, I would. I'd know you anytime.
"Anyplace, anywhere."
You're repeating yourself. You said that when you proposed.
You still remember it.
If I didn't remember it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
I sort of wish you hadn't.
- What?
- Divorced me.
It makes a fellow lose faith.
It gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
That's what divorces are for.
Nonsense, you've got an old-fashioned idea divorces last forever.
"Till death do us part." Divorce doesn't mean anything.
Just a few words mumbled by a judge.
- I suppose you're right, in a way.
- I am fond of you, you know.
- Thattagirl!
I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
You must meet my mother. She'd like that.
Why'd you promise not to fight the divorce and then gum up the works?
I meant to let you go, but you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
A big lummox like you, hiring an airplane to write:
"Hildy, don't be hasty. Remember my dimple. Walter."
It delayed our divorce while the judge watched it.
I've still got the dimple, and in the same place.
I acted like a husband who didn't want his home broken.
- What home?
- Remember the home I promised you?
Sure I do. That was the one we were to have right after the honeymoon.
That honeymoon!
Was it my fault?
Did I know that coal mine would have a cave-in?
I intended to be with you on our honeymoon.
Instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom I spent two weeks in a mine with John Kruptzky.
You deny it?
We beat the whole country on that story!
That isn't what I got married for!
Oh, what is the good?
Look, Walter.
I came to tell you to stop phoning me a dozen times a day sending me 20 telegrams...
- I write a beautiful telegram.
- Are you gonna listen?
What's the use of fighting?
I'll tell you what you do.
Come back to work on the paper, and if we can't get along we'll get married again.
- What?
- I haven't any hard feelings.
Walter, you're wonderful, in a loathsome sort of way.
- Be quiet so I can say what I have to.
- Tell me over lunch.
I have a lunch date.
- Break it.
- I can't.
Hands off!
Are you playing osteopath?
Temper, temper.
You are no longer my husband and no longer my boss.
And you won't be my boss.
- What does that mean?
- Just what I say.
You're not coming back to work?
You're right for the first time today.
- Got a better offer?
- You bet.
Go on, work for somebody else!
That's the gratitude I get.
Stop hamming.
Five years ago, you were a college girl. I took a doll-faced hick!
You wouldn't have if I wasn't doll-faced.
It was a novelty to have a face to look at without shuddering.
I made you a great reporter. You won't be as good on another paper.
We're a team. The paper needs both of us!
Sold American!
- All right, go ahead.
- Listen, Walter, please.
The paper's gonna have to get along without me. So will you.
It didn't work out.
It would have if you'd been satisfied as editor and reporter.
But you had to marry me.
I wasn't satisfied?
I suppose I proposed to you!
Practically!
Making eyes at me until I broke down.
"Oh, Walter!" I was tight when I proposed to you.
If you'd been a gentleman, you'd have forgotten it.
You used to pitch better than that. Hello. What?
Sweeney?
What can I do for you?
What?
I'm not Sweeney. I'm Duffy.
You can't do that. Not today, of all days!
What's the matter with you?
Are you loony?
Now, listen, Sweeney. This is no time...
All right, I suppose so. If you have to, you have to.
- He had to.
- Everything happens to me.
365 days in a year, and this has to be the day.
What's wrong?
- Sweeney.
- Dead?
He might as well be. He picks today to have a baby!
Not on purpose?
He's supposed to cover the Earl Williams case, and where is he?
Walking around a hospital. Is there no honour?
Haven't you got anybody else?
Nobody else on the paper can write. This'll break me. Unless...
Hildy.
- You can help me.
- Not a chance.
- Get out, Duffy! - Save your breath.
- This'll bring us together again.
- That's what I'm afraid of.
This is bigger than anything. Do it for the paper.
Scram, Svengali.
If not for love, how about money?
I'll raise you $25 a week.
Listen to me, you baboon...
- I'll make it $35 and not a cent more.
- Listen!
- How much will the other paper pay?
- There's no other paper.
The raise is off. You get your old salary.
Trying to blackjack me.
- I'm busy.
- Look at it.
Do you know what it is?
It's an engagement ring.
Engagement ring?
I tried to tell you right away, but you would start reminiscing.
I'm getting married and as far away from newspapers as I can get.
- What? - I'm through.
- You can get married, you can't quit.
- No? Why not?
I know what it would do.
- What?
- It would kill you.
- You can't sell me that.
- You're a newspaperman.
I wanna go where I can be a woman.
- You mean a traitor.
- Traitor to what?
To journalism. You're a journalist!
A journalist?
What does that mean?
Peeking through keyholes, chasing fire engines waking people up to ask them questions stealing pictures off old ladies?
I know about reporters.
Buttinskies running around with no money, and why?
So a million people will know what's going on. Why, I...
What's the use?
You wouldn't know what it means to want to be respectable and live a halfway normal life.
The point is, I'm through.
- Where did you meet this man?
- Bermuda.
Rich?
He's not what you'd call rich. He makes $5000 a year.
- What's his line?
- He's in the insurance business.
- Insurance business?
- That's a good, honest business, right?
Sure, it's honest. It's also adventurous.
I can't picture you being surrounded by policies...
I can, and I like it, what's more.
He forgets the office when he's with me.
He doesn't treat me like an errand boy, but like a woman.
How did I treat you?
Like a water buffalo?
I don't know from buffaloes. I know about him.
He's kind, sweet and considerate.
He wants a home and children.
Sounds like a guy I should marry. His name?
I knew a Baldwin once, a horse thief. Couldn't be the same fella, could it?
You're not talking about the man I'm marrying tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
As soon as that?
At last, I got out what I came up here to tell you.
Guess there isn't any more to the story.
So long, Walter.
So long, Hildy.
Better luck next time.
Thanks.
Well, you kind of took the wind out of my sail.
I just want to wish you everything I couldn't give you.
This other fellow. I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to see him.
I'm particular about whom my wife marries.
Where is he?
He's right on the job, waiting for me out there.
Do you mind if I meet him?
- It wouldn't do any good.
- You're not afraid?
Of course not.
Let's see this paragon. Is he as good as you say?
He's better.
- What does he want with you?
- You got me.
Back in an hour, Mildred.
I am sorry. I suppose Bruce...
What's his name?
- I suppose he opens doors for you?
- And with a lady, he takes his hat off.
I am sorry.
When he walks with a lady, he waits for her.
In that case...
Allow me.
I can see my wife picked out the right husband for herself.
There must be a mistake. I'm already married.
Already married?
You should have told me. Congratulations again.
- No, my name...
- Mr. Burns.
I'm busy. What did you say, Mr. Baldwin?
- Mr. Burns.
- My name is...
I'm busy with Mr. Baldwin. I didn't hear you.
- My name is...
- Mr. Burns...
- What is it?
- I'm Bruce Baldwin.
Can't you see I'm...?
You're Bruce Baldwin!
Who is he?
Who are you?
My name's Pete Davis.
Mr. Davis, is this any concern of yours?
From now on, keep your nose out of my affairs.
Don't let it happen again.
I'm terribly sorry about this mistake. This is indeed a pleasure.
That's wrong, isn't it?
Bruce... Do you mind if I call you Bruce?
- We're almost related.
- No, not at all.
You see, my wife... That is, your wife.
Hildy, you led me to expect you were marrying a much older man.
What did I say?
Don't worry. I realize you didn't mean old in years.
- You always carry an umbrella?
- It looked cloudy.
That's right. Rubbers too, I hope.
Thattaboy!
A man ought to be prepared.
We'd better run along.
- We'd better go.
- Where?
To lunch. Didn't you tell him?
No, she didn't.
I guess she just wanted to surprise you, Bruce.
After you, Hildy.
You're wasting your time.
No, I'm glad to do it.
Hello, Gus.
It's Hildy!
- None other. How are things?
- Can't complain.
I can. I'm hungry. A roast beef sandwich...
- Sorry.
...on white bread.
Over there, Bruce.
- And you, Hildy?
- I'll have the same.
- You, sir?
- That's all right for me.
Bring some mustard too, Gus.
So you two are gonna get married?
- How does it feel, Bruce?
- Awful good.
- You're getting a great girl.
- I realize that.
Things have been different since I met Hildy.
I've never met anyone like her.
Everybody else I've known you could tell ahead of time what they'd say or do.
But Hildy's not like that. You can't tell that about her.
That's nice.
You're getting a great newspaperman too.
No orchids, Walter.
One of the best I ever knew. Sorry to see her go.
- I'd like to believe you.
- I mean it.
- Lf you ever want to come back...
- Which I won't.
In spite of it all, there's only one man I'd work for.
I'd kill you if you worked for anybody else.
- Hear that?
That's my diploma.
- It must be quite a business...
- Are you sure you wanna quit?
- What do you mean?
If there is any doubt or if there's anything...
No, this is your chance to have a home and to be a human being.
I'll make you take that chance.
Certainly. Why, I wouldn't let her stay.
She deserves all this happiness. All the things I couldn't give her.
- All she ever wanted was a home.
- I'll certainly try.
I know you will.
- Where will you live?
- Albany.
- Got a family up there?
- Just my mother.
Your mother. You'll live with her?
Just for the first year.
That will be nice.
Yes, a home with Mother, in Albany too.
Nice little town. It's the state capital.
I know. We were there once.
Remember the night you brought the governor to the hotel?
You see, I was in taking a bath. Well, I came walking out without...
She didn't know I was in town.
Bruce, how is business up there?
Any better?
Albany's a good insurance town.
People take it out pretty early in life.
- I can see why they would.
- Statistics show that most...
I've got a feeling I ought to have taken out a little insurance.
That really doesn't matter now that Hildy and I have well, you know, we've...
Does it?
What do you think?
It might have been a good idea if I had taken out insurance.
I feel that way.
I'm in one business that really helps people.
Of course, we don't help you much while you're alive, but afterward.
- That's what counts.
- Sure.
- I don't get it.
- Nice going.
Sorry, Gus. My foot slipped.
That's all right. What would you like to drink?
Coffee.
- Shall I put rum in the coffee?
- Sure.
Me too, Gus, please.
- Not for me.
- Go on, Bruce.
I have a lot to do. I have to buy the tickets, check the baggage...
Do it tomorrow.
We're leaving today at 4:00, taking the sleeper for Albany.
Oh, you're leaving today at 4:00?
- That's only two hours.
- That's not much time.
I've got a lot to do.
Isn't that silly?
All down over my front.
- That's nothing new.
Here. - I'll get Gus.
Do something about this, will you?
Call me to the phone when I sit down.
Thanks, Gus, that's fine.
I'm terribly sorry about that. That was silly.
Let me get that straight. I must have misunderstood you.
You're taking the sleeper today, then marrying tomorrow?
- Well, it's not like that.
- What is it like?
Poor Walter. He'll toss and turn all night.
Better tell him Mother's coming too.
- Your mother kicked the bucket...
- No, my mother.
Your mother?
That relieves my mind.
It was cruel to let you suffer so.
Isn't Walter sweet?
Always wanting to protect me.
I wasn't much of a husband, but you can count on me.
I don't think she'll need you much. I aim to do the protecting.
Mr. Burns, telephone.
For me?
That's strange.
Pardon me.
He's not such a bad guy.
No, he should make some girl real happy.
Slaphappy.
He's not the man for you, I can see that.
But I like him. He's got charm.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
Hello?
Duffy, listen.
Any way we can stop the 4:00 train to Albany?
- We might dynamite it.
- Could we?
Maybe we couldn't. All right, get this.
Send Sweeney out of town on two weeks' vacation right away.
Keep your shirt on. Hildy's coming back.
She doesn't know it, but she's staying.
Tell Louie to stick around. I may need him. Goodbye.
Thanks, Gus.
- This is bad business.
- What is it?
- The Earl Williams case.
- I read about that.
It's pretty bad.
- What's the lowdown?
- Simple.
Poor dope lost his job, went berserk and shot a cop.
They'll hang him tomorrow.
- What a shame.
- Your paper has been taking his side.
If he was crazy, why doesn't the state put him away?
It was a coloured policeman. You know what that means.
- The coloured vote's important.
- Especially with an election coming.
That mayor would hang his grandmother to be reelected.
You could show the man wasn't responsible.
That's not so easy.
Maybe it isn't so hard either.
What do you mean?
Another expert has to examine him before they hang him, right?
A bird named Egelhoffer's doing it. He'll say the same thing.
- Suppose he does.
- What's your scheme?
You get the interview with Earl Williams.
Print Egelhoffer's statement. Alongside it, run your interview.
Alienist says he's sane. Interview shows he's goofy.
You could save that poor devil's life. You could...
- You're going away.
- How long would the interview take?
An hour for the interview. An hour to write it.
We could take the 6:00 train if it'd save a life.
No. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, write it yourself.
I can't write this. It takes a woman's touch.
Don't get poetic. Get Sweeney.
He's the best man for that sob-sister stuff.
Duffy just told me his wife finally had twins. Isn't that terrible?
Sweeney went out, and we can't find him. He has twins, and Williams gets hanged.
Now, Walter, look.
Argue with her, or you'll have blood on your hands.
How can you be happy after that?
You'll remember that a man went to the gallows because she was too selfish to wait two hours.
Earl Williams' face will come between you tonight and the rest of your life.
Stop it, Walter. The whole place will hear you.
What an act.
I just remembered Sweeney was only married four months ago.
Hildy, you win. I'm licked.
Then Mrs. Sweeney didn't have twins?
No, indeed. The twins were Walter's.
It was nothing.
Let's forget it. We'll start over again.
- I'll offer a business proposition.
- Not interested.
You'll be interested.
Don't listen to him. I know him from way back.
Excuse me, will you?
I'm talking to him.
Now, look, Bruce persuade her and you can write an insurance policy for me.
I wouldn't use my wife for business purposes.
Wait a minute, Bruce.
- How big a policy?
- 25,000. 50,000.
What's the commission on a $100,000 policy?
- $1000, but...
- What's wrong with $1000?
We could use that money.
How long would it take to get him examined?
I could get a doctor in 20 minutes.
- Get him.
- You keep out of this.
Suppose you have him examined in his office and see what they'll allow on his carcass.
- I'm better than ever.
- That's nothing to brag about.
I'll go back and change, and after you get the check, phone me.
I'll be in the press room at criminal court.
Walter.
I think you better make that a certified check.
Think I'm a crook?
Yes. No certified check, no story.
It'll be certified. Want my fingerprints?
- No. I've still got those.
- Gus, how much do I owe you?
Thank you, dear.
- Sorry.
- How much money do you have?
Everything we have, $500.
- Give it to me.
- But the tickets...
I'll buy the tickets. He'll get you in a crap game.
I don't gamble.
I know people that never did anything till they met Walter.
Remember, it's everything we have.
I know.
- You got change of ten?
- See what I mean?
I gave everything to Hildy. I've got...
- Come on.
- Not me. Sign it.
All right.
For the waiter.
Come on, Bruce. Really.
- I'll open for a dime.
- I'm in.
- I'll stay.
- Wilcox 3400.
- How many?
- Two.
Take that, one of you birds. You ain't doing anything, Ernie.
What's the matter with you guys?
I'll bet 20 cents.
Press room. Wait a minute.
Hello, sarge, McCue talking. Hold the line, will you?
What?
This is the press room of the criminal courts building.
New lead on the hanging. This alienist from New York, Dr. Max J. Egelhoffer.
He's interviewing Williams in the sheriff's office.
Must be the 10th alienist they've had.
If he wasn't crazy, he would be after ten of those babies psychoanalysed him.
- Is Egelhoffer any good?
- You figure it out.
They sent him to Washington to interview the Brain Trust.
He said they were sane.
Here's the situation before the hanging.
I'll pick up a little fudge. This is Murphy.
More on the hanging.
A double guard is around the jail, municipal buildings, and terminals to prepare for the expected uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
The sheriff's assigned 200 relatives to guard against the Red Army which is leaving Moscow in a couple minutes.
When the real Red Menace shows up the sheriff will still be crying wolf.
- Is that good?
- Looks good from here.
Hildy, when did you get back?
- How are you, Eddie?
- Glad to see you.
Where'd you get the hat?
- I paid 12 bucks for it.
- Coming back to work?
It's a farewell appearance. I'm going into business for myself.
- What doing?
- I'm getting married tomorrow.
Again?
Are we invited to the wedding?
I might use you for a bridesmaid, Roy.
- How are you, Murphy?
- What are you getting married for?
- None of your business.
- You ain't fooling?
Fooling?
Look what I've got in here.
Three tickets to Albany on the 6:00 train tonight.
Three?
For me and my beau and, hats off, boys, his sweet darling ma.
- That's nice.
- What kind of marriage is that?
I'm settling down. I'm through with the newspaper business.
Can you picture Hildy singing lullabies and hanging out didies?
- Swapping lies over the fence?
- Sour grapes.
- She'll get tired of beating rugs.
- I'm not going to beat any rugs.
That's Third and Jefferson. Where the Central School is.
- No school this time of day.
You quit.
- You said you were through.
- I thought it might be a good fire.
- What's that?
- Practising for the Williams party.
- You'll miss a nice hanging.
- Not interested.
Tell them to pipe down.
Keep quiet down there!
How do you expect us to get any work done?
Shut up!
Little respect for the press around here.
- Say, did anybody phone me?
- Not that I know of.
Say, does Walter know you're getting married?
- Just had lunch with him.
- He knows you're quitting?
- I told him. Any more questions?
- Shall I deal you in?
I haven't got time. I have to do a yarn on Williams.
Did he know what he was doing?
If you ask us, no. If you ask the alienist, the answer's yes.
- What's he do?
- He was a bookkeeper.
He starts at $20 a week.
After 14 years he works himself up to $17.50.
- Got more gum?
McClosky Company goes out of business. Williams loses his job.
Can't get another.
I'm in.
So he hangs around the park listening to soapbox spellbinders making speeches and believes them.
- Makes some of his own.
- Up a dime.
- I'm in.
- Anything else, doc?
- No, that'll be all.
Everything okay?
Nothing to worry about.
Good, good.
- How are you doing, Bruce?
- Just one more thing.
- Good day, Mr. Baldwin.
- Goodbye, doc. Thanks very much.
Who's the beneficiary?
- Excuse me?
- That is, in case of your death.
- Who do we pay the money to?
- Why, Hildy, of course.
I don't know. That'd make me feel pretty funny.
Now, why shouldn't I make Hildy my whatever-it-was?
I should take care of her.
But you will take care of her, Bruce.
If that doctor's right, I'm good for a long time yet.
Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honour with me.
I was a bad husband to Hildy.
She could have claimed a lot of alimony. But she wouldn't take any.
She was too independent.
- I'm independent too, you know.
- I know you are.
But look, you just figure it this way.
I'm good for, we'll say, at least 25 years yet.
By then, you'll have made enough so that money won't mean anything to you.
But suppose you haven't made good.
What about Hildy's old age?
Think of Hildy.
I can see her now.
White-haired, lavender and old lace.
- Can't you see her, Bruce?
- Yes, yes, I can.
She's old, isn't she?
Don't you think that Hildy's entitled to spend her remaining years without worries of money?
Of course you do, Bruce.
Of course, if you put it that way.
And remember, I love her too.
Yes, I'm beginning to realize that.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know until I've passed on.
Maybe she'll think kindly of me after I'm gone.
You make me feel like a heel, coming between you.
No, no, Bruce. You didn't come between us.
It was over for her before you came.
What do you want? - Can I see you a minute, please?
Excuse me, Bruce.
Did you get it, you get it?
Where is it?
Come on.
- Certified?
- Sure. But, Walter, that's for $2500.
- Here we are, certified and everything.
- Certified.
I'm afraid Hildy'll feel ashamed to think she hasn't trusted you.
She'll know some day.
You promised to phone her as soon as you got the check.
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
Get me Hildy Johnson, press room, criminal courts building.
Sit down, Bruce. The operator will get her for you.
Excuse me, will you?
Yes, I'll wait, thank you.
Start hollering. Hildegarde.
Thank you.
Hildy Johnson speaking.
Take it easy, will you?
Did you get the check?
Is it certified?
Certified and everything. I have it right in my pocket.
In your pocket. That's fine.
Wait. Maybe it isn't so fine. Where are you?
Mr. Burns' office.
Is he there?
Look, Bruce. I don't want you to carry that check in your pocket.
Well, because...
Yes, yes, I know all that. But...
There's an old newspaper superstition your first big check you put in the lining of your hat.
- In your hat. It brings good luck.
- I never heard that before.
Neither did I. I know it sounds silly, dear, but do it for me.
Yes, yes, right now.
All right. Just a minute.
There, I've done it.
Anything else?
Oh, yes.
All right.
Yes, I'll tell him. Goodbye.
- Everything all right?
- Hildy said she'll get to work.
- Fine.
- I must be going now.
You don't want to forget this. It might rain, you know.
You mind if I don't show you out?
I'm so busy in here.
Thanks for everything.
- Excuse me?
- Thanks for everything.
Nonsense. Don't thank me. I should thank you.
- So long.
- So long.
Hello, Cooley.
What are you doing here?
I want an interview with Williams.
- No interviews.
- Why?
Sheriff's orders. Besides, a doctor's coming over. Can't do it.
Say, is this your money?
- No.
- 20 bucks?
- Yeah.
- That's what I thought.
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Open up here.
- Now, Hildy, don't be...
- I won't be long.
- Hello, Earl.
- Hello.
I'm Johnson. Mind if I talk to you for a bit?
No, I haven't anything else to do.
I guess that's right.
So I couldn't plead insanity. I'm just as sane as anybody else.
- You didn't mean to kill the policeman.
- It's against everything I stand for.
They know it was an accident. I'm not guilty.
It's just the world.
I see what you mean.
Sorry about the lipstick, Earl. Now, look, after you lost your job what did you do?
I tried to find another job.
How did you spend your time?
I used to sit around in the park, anyplace. I don't smoke.
When you were in the park, did you hear any speeches?
You mean those fellows that talk too much?
I didn't pay any attention...
- Did you hear anything they said?
- Yes.
Is there anything in particular you remember?
- There was one.
- What did he talk about?
He talked about production for use.
Production for use?
Yes, he said everything should be made use of.
Makes sense, doesn't it?
Yes, I liked him. He was a good speaker.
When you found yourself with that gun and that policeman coming at you, what did you think?
I don't know exactly.
Could it have been "production for use"?
- I don't know. L...
- What's a gun for, Earl?
A gun?
Why, to shoot, of course.
Maybe that's why you used it.
- Maybe.
- It seems reasonable.
Yes, yes, it is.
I've never had a gun in my hand before.
And that's what a gun's for, isn't it?
- Maybe that's why...
- Sure, it is.
That's what I thought of. " Production for use." It's simple, isn't it?
- Very simple.
- There's nothing crazy about that.
- Nothing at all.
- Write about that in your paper.
You bet I will. Who sent you the roses?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's wonderful...
Is that her picture?
- Yes. She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Time's up, Hildy.
All right.
Guess that's all.
I liked talking to you. Goodbye, Miss Johnson.
Goodbye, Earl.
Good luck.
- Three landladies, boys.
- Did well, didn't you?
What will the Post do without Hildy?
You suppose Burns will ever let her go?
Remember when Fenton wanted to go to Hollywood?
- Had him thrown in jail for arson.
- Forgery.
- Was that it?
- Yeah, give me some change.
Hey, Mac.
Hey, Stairway Sam.
Would you mind turning on some lights?
It's so dark, you can't see.
- Who's this guy Hildy's marrying?
- I don't know. Bruce something.
- I give the marriage six months.
- Why?
She can't stay away from the paper.
Did you see her when that bell went off?
It must be pretty nice to be able to walk out of a place and quit.
I had a publicity job offer last year. I should have taken it.
I'd like that, a job on the side.
A desk and a stenographer. I wouldn't mind a nice, big blond.
With big brown eyes.
I'll bet you ten to one it don't last six months.
She's like us, or we wouldn't be waiting for that guy to dance.
- Miss Mollie Malloy.
- Hello, Mollie. How's tricks?
- I've been looking for you tramps.
- Come to pay a call on Williams?
Nice roses you sent Earl. What do you want done with them tomorrow?
A lot of wise guys.
You're interrupting. What do you want?
I came to...
I came to tell you what I think of you.
Keep your shirt on.
If you was worth breaking my nails, I'd tear you open.
What are you sore about?
That was a swell story we gave you.
You've been making a fool out of me long enough.
I never said I loved Earl and wanted to marry him on the gallows.
You made that up.
And my being his soul mate and having a love nest with him.
You've been around him since he got in the death house.
- That's a lie.
- Everybody knows you're his girlfriend.
I met Mr. Williams just once in my life.
When he was in the rain without his coat on like a sick dog, before the shooting.
- Give me one.
- I went up like any human would and asked him what was wrong.
He told me about being fired after being on the job for 14 years.
- Who bets?
- Bet 20 cents.
I brought him to my room because it was warm.
Put it on a phonograph.
Listen to me, please.
I tell you he just sat there talking to me all night.
He never once laid a hand on me.
And in the morning he went away and I never saw him again till the trial.
- Sure, I was his witness.
- What a witness.
That's why you persecute me.
Because Earl treated me decent, and not like an animal.
- He's got a nice room.
- Not for long.
He left a call for 7 a.m.
It's a wonder lightning don't come down and strike you all dead.
What's that?
They're fixing up a pain in the neck for your boyfriend.
Shame on you.
Shame on you!
A poor little fellow that never meant nobody no harm.
Sitting with the Angel of Death, and you cracking jokes.
- You're gonna get out of here.
- Take your hands off me!
- Let's get out of here.
- They ain't human.
- They're newspapermen.
- All they've done is lie.
All they're doing is writing lies.
Why won't they listen to me?
Why won't they listen to me?
Who?
Hildy Johnson?
Hang on. She'll be back in a minute.
You guys want to play any more cards?
What's the use?
I can't win anyway.
Gentlemen of the press.
Hildy.
Phone for you.
What?
Where are you?
You're where?
Well, how did that happen?
Never mind, never mind. I'll be right down.
I'm sorry, Pete. Sorry.
Hi, sheriff. How you doing?
My shin and my back. What's going on around here?
- Bruce was in trouble.
- Lioness rushes to defend cub.
Man forgets hankie. Mama goes to wipe nose.
I still give the marriage six months.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What do you want, Pete?
Oh, I got the tickets for the hanging here, boys.
- Pete?
- What?
Why can't you hang this guy at 5:00 instead of 7?
It won't hurt you, and we can make the city edition.
That's kind of raw, Roy, hanging a man in his sleep to please a newspaper.
But you can reprieve him so he hangs three days before election.
You can run on a law-and-order ticket.
I had nothing to do with those reprieves.
How do we know there won't be another?
What if Egelhoffer finds him insane?
He won't find him insane, because he isn't. He's just as sane as I am.
Saner!
Be serious, boys. After all, this is a hanging.
It's gonna go according to schedule.
Seven o'clock in the morning and not earlier.
There's such a thing as being humane.
Okay, Pinky. Wait till you want a favour.
- And please don't call me Pinky.
Because I got a name, see, and it's Peter B. Hartwell.
- What's the B for?
- Bull.
I'm innocent. I didn't do it. I never stole a watch in my life!
I know you didn't. Mike, let him out.
I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch they found on him.
- But I never stole...
- Please.
All right, you're not. Read the Post tomorrow.
I can't imagine who'd do that to me.
- I can't think of an enemy.
- I'm sure you haven't any...
- Have you got the check?
- Yes, I have it right here.
That's a funny superstition you newspaper people have.
Yes, isn't it?
About being arrested, I thought Walter Burns might have something to do with it.
But then I realized he couldn't have.
- Why?
- He's a very nice fellow.
Oh, yes, I found that out.
- What's the matter?
- I've lost my wallet.
Yes?
Well, Bruce, never mind. I have the money.
- Better give me the check. - And that picture of us in Bermuda.
Don't bother, Bruce. You'll find lots of things missing.
Wait here. I'm not taking any more chances.
I'll be down in three minutes. We'll take the next train. Sorry.
"And so into this little tortured mind came the idea that that gun had been produced for use.
And use it he did.
But the state has a production- for-use plan too. It has a gallows.
And at 7 a.m., unless a miracle occurs, that gallows will be used to separate the soul of Earl Williams from his body.
And out of Mollie Malloy's life will go the one kindly soul she ever knew."
That's as far as she got.
- Can that girl write an interview?
- She'll do till somebody comes along.
It's not ethical, reading other people's stuff.
Where do you get that ethics stuff?
You're the only one who'll swipe it.
I say anybody that can write like that won't give it up to sew socks for a guy in insurance.
Now I give that marriage 3 months, and I'm laying 3-to-1.
- Any takers?
- I'll take that bet.
A girl can't leave the room without being discussed by old ladies.
Hello, Post?
Get me Walter Burns, will you, please?
Don't get sore. We were only saying a reporter like you wouldn't quit easy.
This is Hildy Johnson. I can quit all right, without a single quiver.
I'll live like a human, not like you chumps.
Is that you?
I've got some news for you.
I got the interview, but I've got some more important news.
Better get a pencil and take it down.
All ready?
Get this, you double-crossing chimpanzee.
Your check leaves with me in 20 minutes.
I wouldn't cover the burning of Rome for you.
If I ever lay my eyes on you again I'll hammer your skull so it rings like a Chinese gong!
You don't know why I'm angry?
Have Louie tell you about his watch.
And there's just one other little thing.
Hear that?
That's the story I just wrote.
I know we had a bargain. I just said I'd write it.
I didn't say I wouldn't tear it up. It's all in pieces now.
I hope to do the same for you someday.
That's my farewell to the newspaper game.
I'll be a woman, not a news machine.
I'll have babies, give them cod-liver oil and watch their teeth grow.
If I see one of them look at a paper, I'll brain him.
Where's my hat?
- Mr. Burns?
Yes, she's still here.
- Give me that.
And another thing I want...
Where is my...?
There it is.
- Doctor. Sorry to be late.
- Quite all right.
These boys from the papers take up my time.
They want me to hang Williams at their convenience.
- Oh, hello, Earl.
- These newspapers.
What they did to me in Chicago!
- Always want interviews.
- Me too.
I did promise to make some statement when I finished.
It's hardly ethical. All statements come from me.
I see. What do you say to giving them some sort of joint interview?
I'll discuss the psychological aspects and you...
We'd have a picture together?
- Shaking hands.
- Splendid idea!
- I don't take a good picture.
- That doesn't matter. Publicity does.
Doctor, I'm getting awful tired.
Can't I go back to jail again?
Sorry. I forgot you were there. We've some further questions for you.
Sheriff, would you extinguish the lights?
That will help with what we're doing here. Now, let me see.
Mr. Williams, you know that you're going to be executed.
Who do you feel is responsible for that?
I am innocent. It wasn't my fault.
- Well, Murph.
- Send us a post card.
- Bye.
- Au rev oir, Hildegarde.
- When will we see you?
- Next time you see me I'll be in a Rolls-Royce, giving interviews on success.
So long, you wage slaves.
When you're climbing fire escapes, getting kicked out front doors and eating in one-armed joints, don't forget your pal, Hildy Johnson.
And when the road beyond unfolds, and the...
Look out!
It's a jailbreak!
What's the matter?
What happened?
Watch where you're aiming, will you?
- Watch the gate!
He'll try the gate!
- Who was it?
- Earl Williams!
- Who did he say?
Earl Williams!
Hello!
Hurry up, this is important.
- Earl Williams just escaped.
- Jailbreak!
- Williams went over the wall!
- I don't know anything yet.
Hello, Post?
Give me Walter Burns, quick. Hildy Johnson.
Walter?
Walter?
Hildy.
Earl Williams just escaped from the county jail.
Don't worry, I'm on the job.
Hey, Cooley!
Wait!
Hey, wait a minute!
Cooley, I want to talk to you!
This is Endicott. Give me rewrite.
He ain't here.
Hello, Gil?
Here's the situation now.
Ready?
Williams was taken to the sheriff's to be examined by Egelhoffer.
In a few minutes, he shot his way out.
Nobody knows where he got the gun. He got out through the skylight.
He must have slid down the rainpipe. No, nobody knows where he got it.
Give me the desk.
The crime commission offers a $10,000 reward.
No clue yet as to Williams' whereabouts.
Here's a feature. An accident about a tear bomb.
Yeah, tear bomb. Criminals cry for it.
I don't know.
The tear bomb went off in the hands of the bombing squad.
These deputies went to the hospital.
- A fine friend you are.
- Wilkerson, the mayor's brother-in-law.
- After all I've done for you.
- Howard Schuster, the sheriff's uncle.
Highlights on Sheriff Hartwell's manhunt.
William Mansfield, his landlord, and Lester Winthrop who married the sheriff's niece.
Call you back.
Mrs. William Rice, scrub lady, while scrubbing the eighth floor was shot by a deputy.
- Look, I'm not...
- There goes another scrub lady!
It was a flesh wound. She's in the hospital.
- McCue speaking. Get the desk.
- Any dope on how he escaped?
The sheriff let him out so he could vote for him.
A man looking like Earl Williams boarded a southbound...
Call you back.
- I thought you'd gone.
- I thought so too.
Get me Walter Burns, quick!
Walter, listen.
I've got the story on Williams' escape, and it's exclusive.
That's right, and it's a pip.
It cost me $450 to tear it out of Cooley.
What's the story?
I'll give it to you. First I have to tell you I gave him money.
And it wasn't mine.
It's Bruce's money, and I want it back.
Bruce's money?
Sure, you'll get it. Now, what's the story?
I'll send the money. I swear it on my mother's grave.
Here's the...
Wait a minute, your mother's alive!
My grandmother's grave. What's the story?
You get that money down here.
All right, here's your story. The jailbreak of your dreams.
Dr. Egelhoffer, the thinker from New York was giving Williams a sanity test in the sheriff's office.
Sticking a lot of pins in him so he could get his reflexes.
He decided to reenact the crime as it had taken place in order to study Williams' coordination.
I'm coming to it. He had to have a gun to reenact the crime.
Who do you suppose supplied it?
Peter B. Hartwell. B for brains.
No kidding!
I'm not good enough to make this one up.
The sheriff gave his gun to the professor who gave it to Earl, who shot the professor in the classified ads.
No, ads. Ain't it perfect?
If he'd unrolled a red carpet it couldn't have been more ideal.
Who?
Oh, no. Egelhoffer wasn't badly hurt.
He's in the hospital, where they're afraid he'll recover.
That's great work, Hildy.
Don't worry about the money. You'll get it in 15 minutes.
I'd better. Bruce is waiting in a taxi for me, and we're in a hurry.
Hold on a minute.
Vangie, come here.
There's a guy in a taxi in front of criminal courts. Bruce Baldwin.
- What does he look like?
- That guy in the movies, Ralph Bellamy.
- Oh, him?
- Can you handle it?
I've never flopped on you yet, have I?
Get going. You only got about two minutes. Hurry.
Sorry to keep you waiting. How much was it again?
$450. Well, just a second.
Louie, come here. I need $450 worth of counterfeit money.
- Can't carry that much, boss.
- No, just the $450 counterfeit.
I got that on me.
Quite a coincidence. Take it to Hildy.
It's coming. I'm sending it with Louie.
Thanks for your story. Good luck on your honeymoon.
No, no, never mind the thanks. Just see that money gets here.
- Hildy, you still here?
- No, I'm in Niagara Falls.
McCue speaking.
Emil, I got a good feature on the manhunt.
Ready?
Mrs. Phoebe DeWolfe, coloured, gave birth to a pickaninny in a patrol wagon, with Hartwell's rifle squad acting as nurses.
Phoebe was walking along the street when...
That's right.
So they coaxed her into the patrol wagon.
When the pickaninny was born, they checked to see if it was Williams.
Here's the payoff. They named the kid Peter Hartwell DeWolfe.
Press room.
Bruce?
I thought you were downstairs in a...
What?
Arrested again? What for this time?
Well, they called it "mashing."
No, I didn't, Hildy!
I was sitting in the taxi where you left me and the young lady seemed to have a dizzy spell and I just...
She's kind of...
Yes, she's a blond.
Yes, very blond.
I know how it happened. Just a minute.
Get me Walter Burns. Hildy Johnson.
Bruce, where are you?
27th Precinct? Hold on a minute.
Walter, you...
He was there a minute ago.
But I want...
"I'm sorry, I can't locate him." Why, that double-crossing...
How about 20 minutes?
I have to wait here for the...
I'll tell you when I see you.
If I ever get my hands on Walter...
- Anything I can do?
- How much money you got?
- $1.80.
- 64 cents.
- Welcome to it.
- Thanks, you better buy an annuity.
What's that, Emil?
No, I can't give you an official statement.
Wait a minute. Here's the mayor. How about a statement, mayor?
- Don't pester me now, please.
- His Honour won't say anything.
- You seen Hartwell?
- Hard to tell.
There's so many cockroaches around...
Wait. How about a statement?
- We go to press in 20 minutes.
- I've nothing to say. Not now.
What do you know about the escape?
- Where'd he get the gun?
- Not so fast.
- About the election...
- What effect will this have on voters?
None whatsoever.
How can an unavoidable misfortune like this have any influence on the upright citizens of our fair city?
Mr. Mayor, please, is there a Red Menace or ain't there?
How did Williams get out?
Have you picked out somebody to be responsible?
Is it true that you're on Stalin's payroll?
The senator claims you sleep in red underwear.
Forget the jokes. Don't forget I'm the mayor and...
Hartwell, I want to see you!
- How'd he get away?
- Where'd he get the gun?
Any statement on the Red Uprising tomorrow?
- Red Uprising?
- There will be no Red Uprising.
The governor says the situation calls for the militia.
I say anything the governor says is a tissue of lies.
Here's a red-hot statement from the governor.
He claims the mayor and sheriff have shown themselves to be a couple of 8-year-olds playing with fire.
You can quote him as follows:
"It's lucky that next Tuesday is Election Day as the citizens will be saved the expense of impeaching the mayor and the sheriff." Call you back.
Nice to have seen you, mayor.
- I've got so much to do. - Wait.
Who engineered this getaway?
- Was it the Reds?
- Was it you?
Me?
Just a minute. I've got him located.
- Williams?
- Where?
Out on Center Street. I got a tip.
- Why didn't you say so?
- The rifle squad's going.
You'll catch him if you hurry.
- Please...
- I wanna talk to you.
I've got a lot to do.
- See here, Fred...
- Pete, you're through.
You mean I'm through?
I'm scratching your name off the ticket and running Sherman in your place.
"Reform the Red with a rope"!
Williams isn't a Red!
There's communistic sympathizers around, and I thought if I got a slogan like that I could...
That's got nothing to do with this case.
There are 200,000 votes at stake. If he don't hang, we'll lose them.
We're going to hang him. He can't get away.
What do you mean?
He did get away, didn't he?
What do you want?
- What is it?
- Are you Sheriff Hartwell?
I'm him. What is it?
You're a hard man to find. I have a message from the governor.
- What?
- It was a reprieve for Earl Williams.
- For who?
- Earl Williams.
You said there wasn't gonna be a reprieve.
It frightens me to think of what I'd like to do to you. Who was there?
- Nobody. He was fishing.
- Get the governor.
He's not there. He's duck shooting.
Blasted nimrod!
Fishing, duck shooting...
A guy who's done nothing for 40 years gets elected governor, and thinks he's Tarzan.
Read that. "Insane." He knows very well Williams isn't insane.
I never met the man.
- Pure politics.
- It's an attempt to ruin us.
- What do we tell the reporters?
- That the party's over because of you.
As an afterthought, tell them I want your resignation.
Hello. Yes, yes, this is Hartwell.
What?
Where?
Holy Moses!
Hold the wire!
They've got Williams!
The rifle squad has him at his house.
- Tell them to hold the phone.
- Hold the wire.
Cover up that transmitter.
Now, listen.
You never arrived.
Yes, I did. I came through there...
- How much do you make?
- I thought he was sheriff...
- What's your salary?
- $40 a week.
How'd you like to make $350 a month?
It's almost $100 a week.
I couldn't afford that.
Who? Me?
They need a fellow like you in the city sealer's office.
- Huh?
- City sealer's.
I should work in the sealer's...
My wife wouldn't like that. She lives in the country with my family.
That's all right. Bring her in. We'll pay all the expenses.
- I don't think so.
I got two kids in school. If they change towns, they'll lose a grade.
No. They'll skip a grade.
I guarantee they'll graduate with honours.
Hold your horses, Olsen. Hurry up.
Now, what do you say?
That puts me in a peculiar hole.
No, it doesn't. You never delivered this.
You got caught in traffic or something.
- I came...
- Pretend you didn't.
Now get out and don't let anybody see you.
- How do I know...?
- Come to my office tomorrow.
- What's your name?
- Pettibone.
- Pettibone?
- Not really.
Lay low and keep your mouth shut.
- I'm tired anyhow.
- Go to this address.
Nice homey place.
They'll take care of you. Say Fred sent you.
- Here's $50 on account.
- I'll tell you in one minute.
You forgot to tell me what a city sealer does.
- Is it hard?
- Easy. Very easy.
Good, my health isn't... My wife...
- We'll fix that too.
- My wife?
- Yes, fix anything. Go ahead.
- They're still on the phone.
- Tell them to shoot to kill.
- But the reprieve!
- Go ahead and do as I tell you.
- Olsen.
Shoot to kill. That's the order. Pass the word.
- $500 reward.
- $500 for the man who does it.
I'll be right over.
Hi, Hildy.
You double-crossing hyena.
What'd you pull on Mr. Baldwin this time?
- Who, me?
- You and your albino.
- Evangeline's no albino.
- She'll do till one comes along.
She was born in this country.
If she tries anything else, she'll have to stay in this country.
- Did you bring that money?
- Oh, yeah, $400.
$450.
All right, you can't blame a guy for trying.
- Give me a receipt.
- I'll give you a scar.
I got plenty of them.
I'll take Mr. Baldwin's wallet too.
- Mr. Baldwin's what?
- His purse. Come on, Louie.
All right, Hildy. I'll do it for you because I like you.
But tell your financier to be more careful, know what I mean?
I'll loan him a pair of your brass knuckles.
Don't talk that way. I'll take that.
- I'll take it to the station.
- Wait a minute!
Take it to the 27th Precinct and tell the cops what happened.
I couldn't do that. Burns would turn me in.
- Not a bad idea.
- Here, catch!
Louie!
Hello, operator. Hildy Johnson. Will you get me...
Drop that phone!
Never mind.
You're not gonna tell anybody where I am.
Put that gun down, Earl.
You don't wanna shoot me. I'm your friend, remember?
I'm writing the story on you of production for use.
- That's right.
Production for use. - You don't want to hurt me...
Don't move!
Maybe you're my friend, maybe not.
But don't come any nearer.
You can't trust anybody in this crazy world.
I don't blame you. I wouldn't trust anybody either.
Don't do that. Put it back. Put it back.
If you try any tricks, I'll shoot you. I can do it right from here.
Sure you could, Earl. But you don't want to do that.
You don't want to kill anybody.
No, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody.
- That's what I thought.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?
To close the door so nobody'd see you.
No, you were going to get somebody.
I don't want that. All I want is to be left alone.
I won't get anybody.
You'll get them after me again. I won't let you do that. I won't...
- Give me that.
- I guess I fired all the shells.
- I'm awful tired.
- That shot. They'll know you're here.
I don't care.
I'm not afraid to die. I told the guy that when he handed me the gun.
- Quiet!
- Waking me up at night.
Talking about things they don't understand.
Shut up.
I wish they'd take me back and hang me.
They will if you don't keep quiet.
I can't survive another day like this.
You think I could?
Get me Walter Burns, quick. Tell him I need him.
Bruce, I know I said I'd be down, but something has happened.
Walter, come right away. Wait, Bruce, I'll explain.
I've got Williams here, in the press room.
On the level. I need you!
Bruce, I've captured Earl Williams. You know, the murderer.
Stay there, Earl. Wait. Bruce, I'll be down.
As soon as I hand him to the paper.
Bruce, I can't. Don't you realize...?
- Who is it?
- Me, Mollie Malloy. Open the door!
- What do you want, Mollie?
- I got to find...
- Where is everybody?
- They've gone.
Please tell me where.
I don't know. I'm awfully busy.
They got him surrounded. They'll shoot him like a dog.
They're looking for you too.
I don't care. Tell me. I ain't afraid of them.
All right, they're down at Center Street and Fourth.
- That's where he used to...
- Mollie, don't go.
Come in, Mollie. Draw up a chair.
- Hello.
- How did you get in here?
Down the pipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. Really, I didn't.
- Be quiet.
- You believe me, don't you?
Sure I believe you.
Thanks for the roses. They were beautiful.
That's all right, Mr. Williams.
- Don't cry.
- Don't you get hysterical.
I gotta get him out of here.
- You wouldn't get down that hall.
- They'll find him.
I'm trying to think before those reporters come back.
Let them take me. What's the difference?
I'll never let them.
Who locked the door?
- Now it's too late.
- Get in this desk.
- Oh, what's the use?
- Come on, get in.
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
Pull yourself together. All right, here. Sit down.
All right, all right, I'm coming!
- Don't kick the building down.
- We got phone calls to make.
What's she doing up here?
What's the matter?
Came up here and had hysterics.
- How do you feel, kid?
- Not so good.
Get you some water?
- Do anything for you?
- You don't look so sick.
- Did you bump into Williams?
- Funny!
- Where is he?
- Let me alone.
- Okay. Give me the desk.
- No harm in asking.
Hello, Jim. Yes, false alarm. They surrounded the house, all right but Williams wasn't there.
The Halloween outside has the police on its ear.
- I thought you left.
- I'm waiting for Walter's money.
What a chase!
Give me Emil.
- Give me the desk.
- Any news, boys?
Yeah, I never been so tired in my life.
Where?
Melrose Station?
All right, connect me. Hello, Mollie. How are you?
Hold it a minute. This looks good.
An old lady claims Williams is hiding under her piazza.
Tell her to stand up.
- You want to go out on it?
- I'll cover this end.
- I spent $1.40 on taxicabs already.
- No more going out.
- Never mind.
- Who pulled the shades down?
They were throwing lights around.
I've got a hunch Williams ain't where they've been looking for him.
He might be in this building.
Sure, hanging around like a duck in a shooting gallery.
From the skylight, but how did he get down?
- I'm pretending there ain't any Earl.
- He could have jumped to this roof.
Then he could slide down the drainpipe.
- And come in any of these windows. - Lf the story walks in the window...
Masterminds. Why don't you go home?
Maybe Williams will call on you.
It'd be funny if he was in the building.
Why not search the building?
- I'm not wandering all over.
- Great bunch of reporters you are.
Too lazy to get the biggest story in years.
You seem pretty anxious to get rid of us.
- Are you trying to scoop us?
- On my own time?
Maybe Mollie's been giving her the story on how Williams got the gun.
I didn't do nothing.
- Come clean.
- Let the girl alone. She's...
Well?
Mrs. Baldwin. Mother.
Don't "Mother" me. Playing cat and mouse and keeping my boy locked up.
Making us miss two trains, and the wedding tomorrow.
- I'll be with you in five minutes...
- Just give me Bruce's money.
You can stay here forever, you and that murderer you caught.
- Murderer?
- Which one of these men is it?
- They all look like murderers.
- What murderer?
I never said any such thing.
I'm quoting my son. He has never lied to me.
Somebody's lying.
- I never said anything like that.
- You did.
I said I was trying to find the murderer.
- Quit stalling.
- She got it balled up.
Who are you holding out on?
Nobody. Now let me go, will you?
Stop it, stop it!
She don't know where he is. I'm the only one that knows.
- Where?
- Try and find out.
- Come on, talk.
- Now you want me to talk?
- Talk.
- Ain't that funny?
You wouldn't listen to me before, and now you want me to talk.
Don't say anything.
- I know what I'm doing.
- Stay out.
- Why didn't you listen to me?
- Cut that out.
- Hands off!
- Where is he?
Why do you wanna know?
So you can write more lies to sell papers?
- Never mind that.
- All right. I'll give you a story.
A wonderful story!
Only this time it'll be true. You'll never find him now!
Get the ambulance, somebody!
Get an ambulance, somebody!
- She's dead.
- No, she isn't killed, she's moving!
- Did you see that?
She jumped.
- I know that.
Where have you got Williams?
Hidden. He's in the desk.
She didn't kill herself.
- How're you doing?
- Let me out.
Quiet. You're sitting pretty.
- What's in there?
- Who are you?
- Bruce's mother.
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!
- You're doing something wrong.
- Mother, please.
- Take her out of here.
- Take the lady to Polack Mike's.
- My name's Louie Peluso.
See that she doesn't talk to anyone. Tell them it's a case of D.T.'s.
Don't worry, Mother. It's temporary.
Let go of me.
- Where are you going?
- To get Bruce out of jail.
- Why did you do this to me?
- Get Bruce out of jail?
How can you worry about a man resting in a police station?
- This is war!
You can't desert me.
- Get off that trapeze.
You've got your story.
"Earl Williams captured by the Morning Post."
I covered your story for you, now I'm out.
You drooling idiot, there are 365 days in a year one can get married.
How many times you got a murderer locked up in a desk?
You got the city by the seat of the pants.
You've got the brain of a pancake.
This isn't just a story. It's a revolution.
The greatest yarn since Livingston discovered Stanley.
- The other way around.
- Don't get technical at such a time.
You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for 40 years and given us a chance to have the kind of government New York has under La Guardia.
If I didn't have your best interest at heart, I wouldn't argue with you.
You've done something big. You've stepped up into a new class.
We'll make such monkeys of those ward heelers, nobody'll vote for them.
- Expose them?
- We'll crucify that mob.
We'll keep Williams undercover until we break the story then share the glory with the governor.
- I get it, I get it.
- You'll kick over City Hall.
You got the mayor and Hartwell backed up against the wall.
This isn't just a newspaper story. It's a career!
And you bellyache about catching the 8 or 9:00 train.
- But I never figured it that way.
- Because you're a doll-faced hick.
They'll be naming streets after you. There'll be statues of you.
The movies will be after you. There'll be a Hildy cigar.
I can see the billboards:
"Light up with Hildy Johnson"...
- We got a lot to do.
- Now you're talking.
- We can't leave Williams here.
- We'll take him to my private office.
- How are you gonna take him?
- We'll carry the desk over.
It's crawling with cops outside.
We'll lower it out the window with pulleys. Start pounding out a lead!
- How much of this stuff do you want?
- All the words you got.
- Can I call the mayor a bird of prey?
- Anything you like.
Give him the works. Hello, Duffy?
We got the biggest story in years.
"Earl Williams captured by the Morning Post. Exclusive!"
Tear out the whole front page.
The whole front page.
Never mind the European war.
We got something bigger than that. Hildy Johnson's writing the lead.
And get hold of Butch O'Connor.
Tell him to come up here with his wrestlers.
Yeah, Butch O'Connor.
What? I've got a desk I want moved...
What the deuce do you want?
- Hello, Bruce.
- Hildy.
Never mind the Chinese earthquake.
- I want to ask you...
- How'd you get out of jail?
Not through any help of yours. I'm not talking to you.
I had to wire Albany for $100 so I could get out on bail.
What will they think in Albany?
The money went to the police.
- We're waiting for that story.
- We'll explain everything to them.
- Where's Mother?
- She left.
I can't hear you.
- Where'd she go?
- Someplace.
- Junk the Polish Corridor!
- Tell me where she was going.
- She couldn't say.
- It's more important.
- Did she get the money?
- She left in a hurry.
- I'll take it.
- In my purse.
I can handle things. I'll take that certified check too.
I'll give you the tickets. You'll find your money in the wallet.
My wallet?
This is my wallet.
There's something funny going on...
What are you doing?
Just wanted to look at it.
Hildy, I'm taking...
- I'm taking the 9:00 train.
- Sure, sure.
Did you hear what I said?
I'm taking the 9:00...
Oh, Bruce, I put it in here!
Let her alone, will you, buddy?
- Do me a favour...
- Just answer one question.
You don't want to come with me, do you?
Answer me. You don't, do you?
No. Take the Miss America pictures off page six.
Hildy, tell me. Tell me the truth.
Wait a minute. Now look here, my good man...
You shut up, Burns.
You're doing all this to her. She wanted to get away from you.
But you caught her and changed her mind...
Stick Hitler on the funny page. Let me ask you...
Will you give up everything for a man like him?
No, but something's happened. I'll tell you...
Tell him nothing. He's a spy, you fool.
- I am not.
- Ridiculous.
You're coming with me right now.
Just a second. This is the biggest thing in my life.
I see. I'll keep. I'm like something in the icebox.
You just don't love me.
That isn't true. Just because you won't listen you say I don't love you.
You never intended to be decent and live like a human.
All right, if that's what you want to think.
I'm trying to concentrate.
- You're just like him and all the rest.
- That's what I am.
What?
Leave the rooster story alone. That's human interest.
If you had any sympathy or understanding...
- I understand, all right...
- Wait.
There's one question I want to know. The mayor's first wife's name.
The one with the wart on her?
Fanny. What, Duffy?
You never loved me at all.
Never mind. You don't work for advertising.
If you change your mind, I'm on the 9:00 train.
If you want me, take me as I am. Don't try to change me.
I'm no suburban bridge player. I'm a newspaperman.
That's it. Keep it coming as fast as you can.
Get back in there, you mock turtle.
Did you tell Butch it's a matter of life and death?
Good. Butch's on his way. We just have to hold out for 15 minutes.
- The boys will be back to phone.
- I'll handle them.
Oh, now the moon's out.
Fine. Three taps is me. Don't forget.
- Not very much.
- That better?
You're sitting pretty.
- How's it coming?
- All right. Where's Bruce?
- He went out.
- Is he coming back here?
Certainly. Didn't you hear him?
What have you got?
"While Hartwell's paid gunmen stalked the city, shooting bystanders spreading terror, Williams lurked..."
Wait a minute. Aren't you going to mention the Post?
- Second paragraph.
- Who reads the second paragraph?
How long have I been telling you how to write?
I'm sorry.
What's the idea of locking this door?
- Who's that?
- Bensinger. That's his desk.
Open the door, will you?
- What's his name?
- Bensinger, of The Tribune.
- The Tribune?
- Who's in there?
Haven't you any better sense...?
Hello. Hello, Mr. Burns. Quite an honour having you come over here.
- Hello, Bensinger.
- You know my...
I just want to get my...
It's quite a coincidence seeing you tonight, isn't it?
How do you mean?
I was talking to our Mr. Duffy about you this afternoon.
Really?
Nothing detrimental, I hope.
On the contrary. On the contrary.
That was one swell story you had in the paper today.
Did you care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
- The poem?
The poem was great.
- I liked the ending a lot.
And all is well outside his cell
But in his heart He hears the hangman calling
And the gallows falling And his white- haired mother's tears
- Heartbreaking?
- Fine.
Would you like to work for me?
We can use a man like you.
All we got are lowbrows like Johnson here.
- Are you serious, Mr. Burns? - Serious?
Wait a minute.
Duffy, I'm sending Mr. Bunsinger over to see you.
- Bensinger.
- Mervyn, isn't it?
- Yeah... No. Roy.
Roy V.
- Certainly.
Roy V. Bensinger, the poet.
You wouldn't know. You probably never heard of Shakespeare either.
Put Mr. Bensinger on staff. How much you getting on The Tribune?
- $75.
- I'll give you 100 and a byline.
Now you give him everything he wants, you understand?
Roy, write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.
He hides, afraid of every sound, every light.
He hears footsteps, they're closing in.
- Get the sense of the animal at bay.
- Sort of Jack London style?
- I'll get my rhyming dictionary.
- It doesn't have to rhyme.
I'm deeply grateful, Mr. Burns.
If there's an opening for a war correspondent I parler a little French.
- I'll keep you in mind.
- Au rev oir, mon capitaine.
Bonjour.
"His white-haired mother's tears." That's the tops.
That fellow Bensinger is on his way right now.
Handle him with kid gloves. Have him write poetry.
We don't want him. Stall him till the extra's out.
Say his poetry smells and kick him out.
Double-crosser.
He won't quit his paper without giving notice.
- I mean you.
- Me?
You'd double-cross anybody...
Wait a minute.
Bruce isn't coming back. He said he was taking the 9:00.
In that case, he's gone.
Don't sit there like a frozen robin. Get on with the story.
We should be finished when Butch arrives.
How you have messed up my life. What am I going to do?
Window's too small. We'll carry the desk.
I'd be on that train now. I'm a sap, falling for your line.
- They'll name streets after me...
- Yes, well, get back to work.
I'm not going back to work. Walter, what...?
- Who is it?
- It's me, boss. It's Louie.
Louie.
- What's wrong?
- Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
What happened?
Down Western Avenue, we was going 65 miles an hour, know what I mean?
Where's the old lady?
We run smack into a police patrol. Busted it in half.
Was she hurt?
Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?
- What did you do with her?
- Search me, when I come to...
You were with her. You were in the cab.
- The driver got knocked cold.
- Butterfingers!
- You handed her over to the cops.
- What do you mean?
They was on the wrong side of the street.
Fine. Now she's probably squawking to the police.
She's not squawking much. You know?
Don't tell me...
Was she killed?
Was she?
Did you notice?
Me with a gun on the hip and a kidnapped lady I'm gonna ask questions from cops?
- You know what I mean?
- Dead, dead. This is the end!
It's fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
What am I going to say to Bruce?
What can I tell him?
If he loves you, you won't have to say anything.
Would you rather have had the old dame drag the police in here?
I killed her. I'm responsible.
What'll I do?
How can I face Bruce again?
- Look at me, Hildy.
- I am looking at you, you murderer.
If it was my own grandmother, I'd carry on.
- You know I would, for the paper.
- Louie, where'd it happen?
Western and 34th.
- I got to get out of here...
- We can do more here. Be calm.
Listen...
- Hello, hello.
- Maine 4557.
Who?
Butch, where are you?
Mission Hospital?
Receiving room.
What are you doing there?
Was a lady brought in from a smashup?
For H. Sebastian, Butch, it's a matter of life and death.
- Nobody?
- I can't hear.
- Morningside 2469.
- You got who?
Speak up. A what?
You can't stop for a dame now!
I don't care if you've been after her. Lives are at stake!
You're going to let a woman come between us?
Was there an old lady brought in in a smashup?
Butch, I'd put my arm in fire for you up to here.
You can't double-cross me.
Look around, please.
All right, put her on. I'll talk to her.
Good evening, madam. Now, listen, you ten-cent glamour girl you can't keep Butch from his duty.
What?
You say that again, I'll kick you in the teeth!
Say, what kind of language is that?
Now, look here, you...
She hung up. What did I say?
How do you like that?
Mousing around with some big...
- Will you shut up?
I'm trying to hear!
- That's cooperation.
Well, where is Duffy?
Diabetes. I should know better than to hire a diseased person.
- Give me Olympia 2136, will you? - Louie!
- Yes, boss.
- Louie, it's up to you.
- Anything you say, boss.
- Get a hold of some guys.
Anybody with hair on his chest, get them off the street.
We gotta get the desk out.
Is it important?
You're the best friend I got.
- I like you too.
- Don't fail me.
Get enough people to move that desk.
You know me. Shirt off my back.
Okay, don't bump into anything.
- Dumb immigrant is sure to flop on me.
- Try the hospital again.
If he's not back in five, we'll carry it out alone.
- Do anything you want.
- There's a million... Could start a fire.
- We'll have the firemen take it out.
- I don't care what you do.
- Come here. See if we can lift it. - What?
Nobody?
Never mind.
- Are you gonna help me?
- No!
- I'll strain my back.
- I'll find Mrs. Baldwin.
- Don't open it!
- I'll go to the morgue...
- We want to talk to you a minute.
- Let go. What's the idea?
Get your hands off me!
- Now, look here, Johnson...
- Hey, you!
You mean me?
Yes, you. What do you mean by breaking in here like this?
I don't care what paper you're editor of.
Let go of me. Something's happened to my mother-in-law.
- We know what you are up to.
- She and Mollie were in here talking.
I know nothing, and there's been an accident.
There's something very peculiar going on here.
- See here...
- Just a moment, Hartwell.
Make your accusations in the proper manner.
Or I'll have to ask you to get out.
- Ask me to what?
- Get out.
You will, eh?
Don't let anybody in or out. We'll see about this.
- Give him the third degree.
- Make them talk and you got him.
I'm going to get to the bottom of this. Are you going to talk?
- What do you want me to say?
- What do you know about Williams?
Now we're getting some...
Take her out. I got ways to make her talk.
Don't you dare touch me or...
- She's got a gun!
- Grab it!
No, you don't. Walter!
All right, Burns. I'll take that gun.
- Where did you get this?
- I can carry a gun.
- Not this gun.
- I can explain it.
She was interviewing Williams, so I gave her a gun to defend herself.
Interesting. But this is the gun that Williams shot his way out with.
Good man, are you trying to make me out a liar?
I ought to know my own gun, oughtn't I...?
- That's where Williams got it.
- She got it from him.
- Where's Williams?
- You're barking up the wrong tree.
Tell me where he is.
At the hospital calling on Professor Egelhoffer with marshmallows.
- Where is he?
- Ask the mastermind why he's here.
- What do you know about this?
- My dear fellow the Morning Post doesn't obstruct justice or hide criminals.
- You ought to know that.
- You're under arrest.
- You too.
- Who's under arrest?
Listen, you square-toed, pimple-headed spy do you realize what you're doing?
I'll show you.
You and the Post are obstructing justice.
- I'll see that you're fined $10,000.
- You'll see nothing.
I'll begin by impounding the Post's property. Is this your desk?
What are you afraid of, Hildy?
I dare you to move this desk.
- Go ahead, try it.
- I will.
I warn you, you move this desk out, I'll put you behind bars.
- He can do it.
- I'll see Roosevelt hears about it.
Tell him. Come on, boys!
- Confiscate it.
- Last chance.
- This is a federal offence.
- We'll take a chance on that.
All right.
Open up this door!
- Mother!
I'm glad to see you...
- That's the man that did it. There.
- What's the idea here?
- She claims she's been kidnapped.
They dragged me down all the way down the stairs and...
Did he do it?
He was in charge. He told them to kidnap me.
Excuse me, madam. Are you referring to me?
You know you did.
What about this?
Kidnapping, huh?
Trying to frame me, huh?
I never saw her before in my life.
What a thing to say!
I was here when that girl jumped out the window.
Get the mayor here.
Madam, be honest.
If you were out joyriding plastered, or in a scrape, why not admit it instead of accusing innocent people?
You ruffian!
How dare you talk like that to me!
He's crazy, Mother.
I'll tell you more. I could tell you why they did it.
They were hiding some kind of murderer in here...
Hiding him?
In here?
Madam, you're a cockeyed liar and you know it!
- What's that?
- He's in there!
- Give me the desk.
- What a break!
- Stand back.
- He might shoot.
- Guns out.
- He's harmless.
- Don't take any chances. - You've got his gun.
Go on, you grey-haired old weasel.
Let me out of here!
Mother!
I was looking all over for you. What happened?
- Jake, hang on.
- Hildy, call Duffy.
- No!
- You want to see us scooped?
- Aim right for the centre.
- That's murder.
Okay, one of you get on each end.
- It's coming up.
- You're covered.
- In a minute.
- Don't move.
- Any time.
- On three.
- It's hot.
- Ready?
- Any second now.
- Three. I got you, Williams.
- Go ahead, shoot me.
- Come out.
Earl Williams just captured in the criminal courts building.
- On your feet.
- Don't try any funny stuff.
Williams was unconscious.
The police overpowered him.
- He offered no resistance.
- His gun wouldn't work.
The Post turned Williams over to the sheriff.
- Put the cuffs on them.
- More later.
An anonymous note led to Williams' capture. Hold on.
The sheriff's tracing a call that gave away Williams' hiding place.
- Where's the old lady?
- She went out.
Call you back.
- Give me the warden's office.
- You'll wish you'd never been born.
Oh, am I?
- Hello, Fred.
- Well, fine work, Pete.
- You delivered the goods.
- Looks natural, don't it?
- Sight for sore eyes.
- Aiding a criminal.
And a little charge of kidnapping...
What's that?
But that's the jail.
Looks like about ten years apiece for you two birds.
When you think you've licked the Post, it's time to get out.
Whistling in the dark won't help. You're through.
Archie Leach said that to me a week before he cut his throat.
Is that so?
We've been in worse jams than this, haven't we, Hildy?
You forget the power that watches over the Post.
- It's not with you now.
- Says you.
I've caught him. Yes, Williams.
Single-handed. Proceed with the hanging, per schedule.
- You'll be in office two days more.
- We'll pull your nose out of that feedbag.
I tell you what you'll be doing. Making brooms in the penitentiary.
Joe?
This is Hartwell.
Come to my office right away.
I captured some important birds. Take their confessions.
Get Liebowitz.
- The lawyers won't help you now.
- You're talking to the Morning Post.
The power of the press?
Bigger men than you have found out what the power of the press is.
Presidents, kings...
- Here's the reprieve.
- Get out.
- You can't bribe me. My wife...
- Get out.
- No, I won't. Here's the reprieve.
- What?
I don't want to be a city sealer.
- Throw him out.
- Out you go.
Wait. Who's trying to bribe you?
- They wouldn't take it.
- Insane!
What did I say?
An unseen power.
What do you mean with a story like that?
He's an impostor.
Trying to hang an innocent man to win an election?
That's murder.
- I never saw him before.
- Lf I was to...
- What's your name?
- Pettibone.
- When did you deliver this?
- Who'd you talk to?
- They started to bribe me.
- They?
- Them.
- It's absurd on the face of it.
He's talking like a child.
- Out of the mouths of babes.
- Hi, babe.
He's insane or drunk.
If Williams has been reprieved, I'm tickled to death. Aren't you?
You'd hang your mother to be reelected.
That's a horrible thing to say about anybody.
You're marvellous. Take a look at that.
- You're an intelligent man.
- Never mind.
Let's have your story.
- Nineteen years ago, I married Mrs...
- Skip that.
She wasn't Mrs. Pettibone then. She was one of the...
This document is authentic. Williams has been reprieved.
Our commonwealth has been saved the necessity of shedding blood.
Get off the soapbox. Save that for The Tribune.
Take those handcuffs off my friends.
- I'm amazed at you.
- Isn't he awful?
You don't know how badly I feel.
No excuse at all for Pete.
- I was only doing my duty.
- That's all right.
- What'd you say your name was?
- Pettibone.
- Here's a picture of my wife.
- Fine woman.
- You haven't seen her.
- She's all right.
She's good enough for me. If I was to tell...
I understand perfectly, and as long as I'm mayor...
Which should be about three hours.
Enough to get out an edition asking for your recall.
And your arrest. You boys ought to get about ten years apiece.
Don't make any hasty decisions. You might run into a libel suit.
- You'll run into the governor.
- We understand each other perfectly.
Yes, and so do I.
So do you what?
And now, Mr. Pettibone we'll deliver this reprieve to the warden's office.
- Lf I was to tell my wife...
- You won't have to.
Wait till they read the Morning Post tomorrow.
Tight squeeze.
- Give me Duffy.
- That's our worst jam.
What?
Where?
Get him.
Remember stealing old lady Haggerty's stomach from the coroner?
Any time you need this guy he's never there.
We proved she'd been poisoned, didn't we?
We had to hide out for a week. Do you remember that?
The Shoreland Hotel. That's how we happened to...
We could have gone to jail for that too.
Yes, maybe you're right, Hildy. It's a bad business.
You'll be better off. You better get going.
- Where would I go?
- To Bruce, of course.
- You know he's gone. He took a train.
- Send a wire.
He'll be at the station when you get into Albany.
- Why doesn't he have a phone?
- I don't know. I got us messed up...
- Get going, Hildy.
- What is that with you?
Wait a minute.
Can't you understand?
I'm trying to do something noble. Get out before I change my mind.
It's tough enough now.
- Just a minute.
- Send him a wire. He'll be waiting.
- Who'll write the story?
- I will. It won't be as good...
It's my story. I like to think that it...
- At last.
- I get it. The same old act, isn't it?
Try to push me out, thinking I'll want to stay.
I know I deserve that. Wait a minute, Duffy.
This time you're wrong.
When you walk out that door, part of me will go right with you.
But a whole new world will open up for you.
I made fun of Bruce and Albany. You know why?
- Why?
- I was jealous.
I was sore because he could offer you the kind of life I can't give you.
That's what you want, honey.
I could do the story and take the train...
Forget it. Come on. Come on.
Goodbye, dear, and good luck.
Duffy, now this is how it goes so far...
Just a minute.
Hello. Who?
Hildy Johnson?
- She just left.
- I'm still here. I can take it.
Hang on a minute.
Hildy Johnson speaking.
The 4th Precinct police station?
I thought you were on your way to Albany...
What for?
For having counterfeit money.
Counterfeit money?
Hold on a minute.
Where did you get it?
I gave it to you?
All right. I'll try and do something about it.
Honey.
Honey, don't cry, please.
I didn't mean to make you cry. What's wrong?
You never cried before.
I thought you were really sending me away with Bruce.
I didn't know you had him locked up.
I thought you were on the level, for once.
That you were just standing by and letting me go off with him and not doing a thing about it.
Come on, honey. What did you think I was, a chump?
I thought you didn't love me.
What were you thinking with?
I don't know.
What are you standing there gawking for?
We have to get him out of jail.
Send Louie down with some honest money and send him back to Albany.
Sure.
Everything's changed. We're coming over to the office.
Don't worry about the story. Hildy will write it.
She never intended to quit. We're getting married.
- Can we go on a honeymoon this time?
- Sure.
Duffy, you can be managing editor.
Not permanently. Just for the two weeks we're away.
I don't know where. Where are we going?
Niagara Falls.
- Niagara Falls.
- Two whole weeks?
Sure, you've earned it. What?
What?
A strike?
What strike?
Where?
Albany?
- I know it's on the way, but...
- Okay, we'll honeymoon in Albany.
Okay, Duffy.
Isn't that a coincidence!
I wonder if Bruce can put us up.
Say, why don't you carry that in your hand?
Twenty-six thousand prisoners were taken, as well as inestimable booty.
By scoring several hits, our artillery... a loaded transport which was about to sail to return to harbor.
Another ship exploded under the fire of German anti-tank guns.
State Department in a statement containing the Secretary's comment...
- Captain. - Yes.
...unofficial reports that extensive bombing in Chungking had been received.
Anyone left the ship, Donkeyman?
Not as I seen, sir.
- New man?
- Yes, sir.
Smith, signed on at Cape Town.
- Check him onboard. - Yes, sir.
That crazy light don't work, sir.
So why didn't you report it when the lights went out?
All right, Mister. Check everyone in the fo'c's'le.
Swanson here.
McDonald?
What? Oh.
Oh, here, sir.
Bergman.
Here.
Davis. Davis!
I'm here.
- In here... - What is it? What's going on?
What are you doing here, steward?
Just turned in for a wink of sleep, sir.
- You're a mighty quick sleeper? - Yes, sir. Always was...
- Oh, tick him off. - Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Do you always sleep with your clothes on?
It's my privilege.
That fellow belong to me.
- Who's missing?
- Driscoll, sir. Bunk's empty.
- Where is he, Swanson?
- Drisk?
Why... Huh.
He was here just a little while ago, sir.
He went to sleep, I suppose, up on fo'c's'le head.
I go find him, tell him you want him, huh?
Stay where you are.
I know that you men have been grumbling about shore leave.
When I found the native police had picked up a seaman ashore,
I guessed it was Driscoll.
Me, sir?
- Did I hear my name, sir? - Where have you been?
I've been having a bit of a nap on the fo'c's'le head, sir.
Oh, it's a grand evening to be taking a few winks on deck.
With that sun coming over the water, sir, I was dreaming...
Never mind about that. Let's have a look at your hands.
The other one.
The back of it, man.
There's a native policeman ashore with a broken jaw.
No skin broken, sir.
Well, I'm glad for once it's someone from another ship.
- Kransky. - Here.
- Hansen. - Here.
- Here.
- Rido. - Here.
What happened, Drisk?
Dawson put up a bit of a fight. Ole.
I'm sneaking back to the boat when two of them native police with their white caps and their brass buttons step out and ask for my pass.
"There's a war on," says they, "and you're not a neutral."
I never was a...
I never was a neutral in all my life.
- Well, one word led to another. - What about the ladies?
The ladies will be aboard any minute now with huge, big baskets of fruit.
Fruit?
Hey, what about the booze?
Under the fruit, there'll be a bottle or two like this for each one of you.
- By jingo, we get drunk! - Shut up, you square-head.
Yeah, shut up.
Would you have the Mate after us?
Well, I hope you enjoyed it.
I did.
There you are.
There's a bumboat coming along the side, sir...
- Right, let them aboard. - Pardon, sir?
- Let them aboard.
I suppose you're wondering why I'm relaxing discipline.
It's none of my business.
I thought the First had told you the orders.
They said the ship was being ordered to the United States, sir, to pick up cargo.
- They tell you what the cargo is gonna be? - No, sir.
It's ammunition, Mister.
Yes, sir.
Come on. Get them up.
Hey, get back there.
Come on. Get them up there.
Driscoll!
You're in charge of this party. And no rough stuff.
No, sir.
- You women bring booze? - Where's the liquor?
Hold your horses, ape!
Is it trouble you're after?
All right. All right.
You want the Mate down on our necks to spoil all the fun?
Into the fo'c's'le with them. Go along now. Come on.
Take them in, fellows. Go on, fellows. Move along.
Hey, he's cheating!
You make so much noise, mister.
Good evening.
You buy from me?
Have you anything to drink?
Thanks.
Thanks. Thank you very much.
Smitty.
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
Drink?
I've done my share of drinking in my time.
Doctor told me I'd have stop it or die, so I stops.
What's troubling you, Smitty?
That singing on the shore getting your nerves?
If I didn't know we were in the West Indies,
I'd imagine we were anchored off some island of the dead.
The ghosts are wailing, Donkeyman.
Natives is queer.
I've known them to keep on singing like that all night long.
I used to worry a lot about dying. I don't no more.
Take that singing now.
Sounds kind of nice and sleepy-like to me.
Sleepy?
If I listen to it much longer sober, I'd never get to sleep.
What's bothering you, Smitty?
Oh, memories, Donkeyman.
Best thing to do with memories is forget them.
Suppose you couldn't forget them?
I'd get drunk, same as you're doing.
Whatever set you going to sea on an old tramp like this?
I suppose there's a woman mixed up in it, ain't there?
- There she is. - Oh, here you are, honey!
You come back!
There's love for you, Smitty.
No memories joined with that.
Every time we get near the land, you get that look on your face.
When a man goes to sea, he ought to give up thinking about things on shore.
Land don't want him no more.
I've had my share of things gone wrong, and all come from the land.
Now I'm through with the land, and the land's through with me.
Too smoky in fo'c's'le. Jiminy!
There's a chap who doesn't worry about it.
He's going back to the land at the end of this voyage.
Olsen?
He'll never get home.
Three times I've seen him paid off.
And it's always one drink with the boys and then...
After this trip, he'll stop trying.
Yes, I dare say you're right.
You're different from the rest of us.
Something on land has still got a hold on you.
It's you ought to be going home.
You leave me out of it, Donkeyman.
Who's going to leave you out of it when we get back to England?
I'm not going back.
- The ship is. - But I'm not.
You mean you're going to desert?
Mind your own business, Donkeyman.
Play us a tune, you lug!
An Irish tune!
Hey, Ed. Want a drink?
Yeah, thanks.
Say, isn't it great? We're gonna booze it on up with a...
You no dance, senor?
I no like these men.
I like you.
Dance with me, querido.
I be your girl.
Dance with...
I don't dance.
Oh, Smitty. Smitty, you dog.
Gee, I almost popped you. You and me is friends, Smitty, ain't we?
- Right you are, Yank. - Ain't we? Sure.
Any pal of mine can have anything I got, Smitty. Anything.
And she's a good-looker, ain't she, Smitty, huh? Ain't she?
Come on, honey.
Boy, she's got a lot of fire, too, huh?
Here, have a drink. Go on. Go on.
Hey, baby, wait minute.
You done that on purpose, you hairy ape.
Who you calling a hairy ape?
You!
You're a cold punching swab.
Well, did you see him?
What I want to know is, are we all friends or not?
- Why, sure we're friends. - There now, have a drink.
- I will. - God bless you.
Hey! Come on deck!
Seamen and firemen fighting, sir.
What's going on here?
They were, all of them, having a bit of a harmless fight, sir.
Knife wound to the shoulder, sir.
- Who knifed him? - I don't know, sir.
It's only a scratch, hit his head on the deck when he fell.
Take him aft. I'll bandage him up.
Look at this, sir.
So that's the trouble, Driscoll.
Take him aft.
- You'll get no money for this last work. - But...
I'll teach you to smuggle rum on a ship and start a riot.
But señor Capitan.
You know the agreement. Rum, no money.
We bring no rum. I no lie to you, senor.
These sailors, they bring the rum.
- We bring no rum. - You're lying!
Clear out! Your boat's alongside. Get along.
None of your lip, or I'll put you ashore and have you locked up.
Hop it.
Go on. Hop it. Come on.
Come on, ladies. Come on.
Mate say we sail at sunrise.
For England.
American port first for cargo, then we go home.
Then I go home.
Time to turn in, Smitty.
Hello, Captain. How are you? That's your ship?
I can just see Ole behind that plow.
Ole be putting a rudder on the horse's tail and a compass on the plow, so that he'll not be digging potatoes when it's turnips he's after.
Hey, Ole, show us how you used to call them pigs.
If I was a swine, I'd be running the other way after that devilin' screech.
You won't go home. You'll get drunk.
The only way you'll see that farm is through a bottle.
You stop that.
Stop what, square-head?
You don't make a fool of Ole.
He's going home. By devil, you've got no home.
I got no home. None of us got a home but Ole.
And if you stop him, I fight you.
You go home, Ole.
Your mother is old. Where's my hat?
She needs you. She wants you. You don't go anymore on sailing.
That's no good, Ole. That's no good.
You go home to your mother.
She's old, and she needs you.
Yeah, I go home.
You go home.
And here are your instructions for the stowage of high explosives.
- High explosives. - Are your cargo holds quite dry?
Oh, yes.
I'm not worried about keeping the cargo dry, but about getting through the war zone.
We haven't enough speed to run away from a rowboat.
Not even a machine gun to make a fight of it.
If anything hits us below the waterline, we'd go up like a kite.
Nevertheless, every ship that gets to England is helping to win the war.
And every officer and man in the merchant marine is doing his bit.
- Unsung heroes... - Is this when you want us to sail?
Time is very important, you know.
Is it?
Unsung heroes.
Like a curse!
Hey, Yank. Drisk.
Come here.
Hey, did you know about this? - What are you talking about?
I was wondering what all them blooming uniformed guards were hanging around for.
- That explains it. - TNT.
TNT, it's high explosives.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
It's worse. It's ammunition.
- By jiminy Christmas. - The devil with it.
Load up an old hooker like this full of that blooming stuff and what is she?
Just a bomb!
A great, big dynamite bomb!
I quit!
Well, we're all quitting, I'm thinking.
I'm through.
Captain wants you out, men. Everybody out.
Sir, what's the meaning of this?
Captain will answer your questions.
But we didn't sign on for the kind...
- Okay, hop it. He's waiting. - Well, so are we.
All right, let the old man himself explain...
By devil, I quit!
I ain't gonna sign on this old tub again.
As far as this job's concerned, you men haven't got any names.
You're just so many hands, just as I am a boss to see this cargo gets to England.
If it doesn't get there, it'll be missed, but we won't.
Now I know it's the usual thing for the fo'c's'le hands to grouse.
So if anybody's got any objection to what I've said, well, step forward.
Well from now on till you're paid off in London, you get 25% bonus on your wages.
There's one thing more.
Owing to circumstances over which I've got no control, nobody is allowed to leave the ship.
May I ask, sir, why are we deprived of shore leave?
For your own safety.
I don't want the cargo talked about ashore.
I think I can be trusted, sir.
When you're drunk?
I maintain, sir, that we're entitled to one night ashore before sailing.
Yeah, I maintain you've said enough, Smith.
I'm as interested in the welfare of my ship's crew as you are.
No more of your lip.
Back to your work.
Roust out, Cocky.
Can't you let a man sleep?
What about the rest of us? The old man wants his coffee.
That means he's going to the bridge. And that means we're gonna sail.
Shake a leg!
Can't let a man sleep.
I'll expose him.
Coffee!
- Well, Captain, goodbye and good luck. - Goodbye, thank you.
Are you quite sure you won't want a pilot?
No, no pilot.
- Well, bon voyage. - Goodbye.
Goodbye.
All clear!
- He came off the Glencairn. - Let's take him aboard!
On your feet!
Take it away!
One of your men, isn't he, mate?
Yes. Get aboard, Smith!
Get aboard. Take it away!
Good night, Drisk.
Good night, Donkeyman. Sweet dreams, too.
Full speed ahead, Mister.
Alter course.
East by north. Half knot.
East by north. Half knot.
Stop that noise!
You square-headed ape.
He was playing soft, Drisk.
Slow her down a few turns.
By golly, I would hate to be on this old tub in rough weather.
Hey, Cocky. Hurry up that Scotch.
Come on! Let's shake a leg!
Come on, Old Murphy. I'll help you. Come on.
Boys, coming... There you are. Now, there you are.
Them sea biscuits would break the tooth of a lion if he had the misfortune of biting one.
Nothing but scarf upon these rusty...
Swill, that's right.
It's a starvation ship. My last trip!
Plenty of work and nothing to eat.
And the owners riding around in carriages.
I think it's that blasted cook.
Fresh meat for the officers and hash for the men. That's his notion.
Hash, hash! Stew, stew!
Marmalade, by jiminy!
We hit something?
It was the anchor.
The anchor's broke loose!
- Contact... - Yank!
Mr. Graves?
Steady kid.
Let me... Let me lie down.
I need to lie down.
Excuse me, sir, but the men in the fo'c's'le are asking if you'll take another look at the sick man.
Is he worse?
He's spitting blood again, sir. Can you do anything for him, sir?
Well, as far as I can make out, those splintered ribs have punctured his lung.
Can you do anything about that, Mister?
- Why, no, sir.
- No, neither can I, and I don't think I'm fooling anybody, pretending to be a doctor.
If it had only happened a week later, we might have made port.
As it is...
All right, Mister. When you leave, first tell him to come here.
I'll go forward and see what I can do.
Yes, sir.
A book and a box of physic!
Suffering Moses! It's colder than kittens up there.
How's Yank, Drisk?
- Your wheel, Scotty. - Aye.
Who's watching lookout?
Me and Drisk.
Oh, it's nothing but dirty weather this whole voyage.
Are you feeling better now, Yank?
You look better. Much better.
Am I telling him a lie?
- Sleep done you good, Yank. - Sure it has.
In no time at all now, you'll be having a pint a beer with us in Limehouse.
What are you all lying for?
You think I'm afraid?
You think I'm scared?
Don't you be thinking such thoughts.
Don't be leaving me, Drisk.
- Ole? - Here, Yank.
Don't leave me.
I'm dying, I tell you.
I won't stay here alone.
I'll go out on deck.
There, there, now.
Don't you be worrying, Yank!
I'll not stir a step out of here, and let that devil of a man curse his black head off.
I take your watch, Ole.
Get me some water. Quick.
Here, here you are, lad.
There you are.
He's just up and having a fainting spell, sir.
Isn't this your watch, Driscoll?
Yes, sir, but Yank was fearing to be alone and...
- Well, that's all right, Driscoll. - Thank you, sir.
Did he take the medicine I sent?
Yes, sir, but it wouldn't stay down.
I'm afraid he's very weak.
Please, sir. Find some way to help him.
My good man, I'm not a doctor.
You and him been shipmates a long time, haven't you?
Yes, sir.
Well, keep him quiet, and we'll hope for the best.
I'll raid the med room and send some medicine, something to ease the pain anyhow.
You'll be up tomorrow. We'll pull you through, all right.
Well, keep your courage up. Coming, Mister?
Didn't I tell you?
Sure the Captain will have you on deck chipping rust before the week is out.
Don't lie, Drisk.
I'm gonna die. The sooner, the better.
Oh, by the Holy, you lad. I'll not let you. I'll not let you.
Give me a drink of water.
My throat's burning up.
How's Yank?
It's asleep, he is.
No, I ain't, Drisk.
I was just dreaming.
I thought I was way in the middle of land, where you could never smell the sea or look at a ship.
Prop me up a little, will you?
So I can breathe.
Thanks.
Where's Ole?
Ole?
Here, Yank.
This ain't no life, Ole.
If you don't leave it this trip, you never will.
We'll both put him on his way home soon as we're all paid off.
Remember the times we've had in Buenos Aires?
- That dance hall in Barracas. Remember? - I do indeed.
Yeah.
And the stink of the hides in La Plata.
Give me a puff, Drisk.
Remember the night I went crazy with the heat in Singapore?
And the time we both got locked up for fighting in Sydney. I do indeed.
That fight on the dock in Cape Town.
I can see his face in front of me.
That guy that I...
Let you not be thinking of that now. That's done and gone and forgot.
It was done in fair fight.
In self-defense, wasn't it?
- Wasn't it, Drisk?
- Indeed it was.
Didn't he try to stab you in the back and you not suspecting?
I wish I had no blackened deed on my soul.
Where's all that fog coming from, Drisk?
Fog?
How'd it get in here?
Of course, lad, it's...
It's just coming in the alleyway.
That's funny.
I thought I could hear the wind blowing outside.
Yank, lad,
I never asked you, but have you no relations at all that you could call your own?
Drisk.
- Drisk? - Yes, Yank?
Remember that little barmaid in the Red Stork in Cardiff?
She was a good kid.
Swell kid.
Lent me dough when I was broke.
Buy her something to...
Give me a drink.
Yank?
Yank, speak to me, lad.
Yank!
Captain sent this medicine for Yank.
He say it would take away his pain where he's hurting.
Yank's gone?
"Before the light of God."
"He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
"Our Lord Jesus Christ, our glorious majesty.
"The seas will give up her dead..."
Thank you, sir.
There's your coffee, Scotty, if you can call it coffee.
What are you doing?
I just paint windows, Drisk.
Have I no eyes in the front of my head?
Mate's orders, Drisk.
We show no lights. With the submarines lying about...
You mean, we're in the war zone?
We'll be tonight. I heard the old man tell the Second.
Wouldn't you think that leg of a Mate would pass the word?
They ain't pasting up no bulletins to let the crew know anything.
I don't like this much.
The lifeboats are ready, ain't they?
Sure, lower them in a second.
Next time I ship on windjammer, Boston to River Plate, loaded with wood only so she float, by golly!
Well, I'm...
Lord!
They're not half smart, them blighters.
What are you buzzing about?
It's written down here in print, or I wouldn't believe it.
It's a true confession.
Confession of what, man?
The fifth column.
Fifth column?
It tells here how a German spy in Paris was writing messages to a woman spy in Switzerland, who sent them on to Berlin, Germany.
That's nothing.
Nothing, is it? Wait till you hear how they done it.
To read their messages, you wouldn't suspect anything, see.
A lot of mush.
The fellows in the War Office that opens them thinks they're nothing but love letters, you see?
But they have a code.
What do you mean, code?
What do I mean? I'll tell you what I mean.
They have a piece of paper with a lot of little holes cut out in it, and when they put it on top of the letters, they see only the words that tell them what they want to know.
And the Frenchmen get beaten up for it all on account of one letter.
That's bad.
The conniving, murdering, tricking... That's the truth.
Here, you can read it for yourself.
No, no, you keep it.
That code, that's no good, by devil!
Come on, Scotty, or the Mate will be down on our necks. Your wheel, ain't it?
Aye.
Shocking! Outrageous! Preposterous!
Hash, stew, marmalade, submarines.
Codes, by devil!
East by north. Three quarters north.
East by north. Three quarter north.
Do you smell the land, Smitty?
Aye, a day and a night now.
Don't let it trouble you, Smitty. Crew don't let on.
But they're always kind of nervous when they get into the war zone first time.
Thanks for the compliment, Donkeyman.
I hope you won't tell anyone you saw me shaking with fear.
- Oh, I didn't mean... - Haven't you ever needed a drink?
Haven't you felt every nerve in your body demanding whiskey?
Haven't you felt like screaming because...
Oh, what's the use of talking about it?
You don't know what I mean.
Indeed, indeed I do.
Look, take my advice. Don't leave the ship.
I'm staying onboard. You won't be alone.
Couple of days in port, and then away to sea again. Why not?
What's it going to be, Smitty?
One big drunk or more memories?
No, I'm gonna enlist.
Good. Navy needs you.
Navy?
No, I'm going in the army if they'll have me.
Skipper wanted his binoculars. Must've left them in the chart room.
"International Code of Signals, British Edition."
Why aren't you up there where you belong?
I see lights from ship.
Right there. First, I think she's submarine, by golly.
I don't see nothing.
She wink on. She wink off. Then she wink away.
Someone is making signals.
No, you're looney.
No, by devil, I see light.
All right, all right. Get up on the topside before the Mate sees you.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Nearly eight bells, Scotty. Rise and shine, Ole.
Come on, you guys. Shake a leg. Get out of there.
- Fog still thick? - Sure, cut it with a knife.
Bloody hate the fog, unless you can hear the foghorn.
Well, what do you wanna do, Cocky? Whistle up a few submarines?
Blasted U-boats. I hope the British navy sinks them all.
Not only the submarines we have to fear, that's what I'm thinking.
Oh, you don't have to worry about mines as far out as this.
I wasn't thinking of mines either.
Your wheel, Ole?
My lookout.
- Ain't it your deck watch? - Yes, yes. Surely.
- I can't figure that guy out. - No, no one has.
Watch that light!
Sorry, Drisk.
- Do you know what I caught him doing? - What?
Going through the old man's code books.
Nah! Smitty, good fellow.
Wanna get square-headed...
Wait till you hear what I seen.
Ole, I see light.
She wink on. She wink off. Then she wink away.
- Sure, Axel. - Yeah.
Hit the bunk!
Taking a gander at the chart.
I think the ship's not safe with the fellow. I think I'll sleep outside on deck.
I tell you, I see that light. She wink on. She wink off.
And that's another thing. How did I forget that?
I thought the square-head was seeing things. Maybe he ain't so dopey after all.
I'm coming along the deck, see, with a coffee pot when...
Curse that fog!
Curse him thick!
Who's the lug put his cup where a man'd sit on it.
Smitty.
He think he's such a fine gentleman that he can't put his own away the same as the rest of us?
- He use for get dressed, Smitty, all right? - All right, is he?
Of course he's all right!
Can't you keep your tempers? It's this blasted fog.
The thought you might be blown to smithereens any minute.
It's my last trip through the zone, so it is.
Devil take them and their 25% bonus.
Be caught like a rat in the trap in the bargain maybe.
- So you think the Duke's all right? - Now look here, my boy...
Look, there it is. That's it.
Are you all crazy?
The light. That's where it comes from. What'd I tell you?
You're showing the lights, you lug.
- Who left that open? - Smitty.
Who has done it if Smitty didn't? It's over his bunk, isn't it?
She wink on. She wink off. Just like wigwag.
Hey, what's going on here behind my back?
That's what we're trying to tell you, Drisk.
Maybe you won't be thinking so much of the Duke when you hear it.
All right, all right. Out with it.
Stop winking and nodding and making a mystery of things.
Keep your eye on the door.
- Sing out if you see Smitty coming. - Yeah.
I see him in the chart room, getting a fix on our course.
I caught him in the Captain's cabin, pouring over the code book, the International Code book.
Easy-peasy.
Take it easy, Drisk.
Shut up.
By jiminy! By devil!
Are you gonna have it out on deck?
Why should we stay here and be blown to bits?
Are you frightened, you toad?
Well, it's a fine thing when full grown men shiver like children at the sight of a little black box.
Still, it's a devilish thing, the look of it.
"A bit of a black box," you call it?
How big do you think it has to be? As big as this fo'c's'le?
It looks bad, so it does.
There's only one consolement.
The traitor's English.
Who says he's English?
Haven't you read how all them German spies has been living for years in London and talks the King's English, as good as I do.
He talks English too good. That's what I mean.
That's right.
I never met a swell that talked the way he does.
Now, listen, Drisk, was he ever open with us like a good shipmate?
No, he always keeps to himself like he was hiding something.
And the name he calls himself, Smith.
I'll bet a buck on my next payday that his real name is Schmidt.
Schmidt.
By devil, Schmidt!
Devil take me if I don't think you have the truth of it.
I wish he didn't come back after he jumped ship in United States.
Jumped ship. Jumped ship!
He was passing the word to some German bloke about the ammunition we're carrying.
I'll lay odds he was trying to sneak in onboard when they nabbed him.
Well, I never was afraid of anything or anyone.
- Don't monkey with it. - Let's see face to face.
- Now get out of here! - Careful, Drisk.
- Get that bucket of water. - What are you gonna do with it, Drisk?
I'll show you what I'll do with this Devil's machinery.
The devil's got you hot as a clam bake?
You guys keep out of this. Stand back.
- Good work, Drisk. - Now, she don't blow up, by golly.
- What do you mean "blow up"? - You pipe down.
Now, let's find this blaggart.
They hang spies on shore, don't they?
Over the side with him, and one man missing in the morning.
He'll go over the side, all right, but not till after he's had a fair trial.
Ain't you seen enough, Drisk?
If Yank, God rest his soul, was here, he'd agree with me. Johnny. Davis.
I found it.
We found it under his bunk. Yeah, under his mattress.
- There's a bomb in there. - I knew. I knew that fellow.
Here, just what's...
If this is your idea of a joke...
We'll show you how much of a joke it is before we're through with you.
If you'll be good enough to explain...
It's you who'll do the explaining, my fine gentleman.
Look at it, you dirty swine.
- Look at it! - What is it?
Thought you wasn't half a fox, didn't you?
It's mine. What are you doing with my things?
What's in it? Would you tell us to our faces?
- That's my business. - Well, we're making it our business.
Get his keys. See if he has one that'll open it.
Don't you open that, Driscoll.
If you do, so help me, I'll kill you if I hang for it.
I am not the one to be killed. I'm no dirty spy.
- Spy?
- We're on to your tricks.
Hiding this box under your mattress so you could sneak out later and put it in the hall.
What are you talking about, you fool?
I only put it there so that I could get it quick in case we were torpedoed. You must be insane!
Keep your mouth shut!
What are you talking about? Let me get out of this...
- Get back there, you lot!
Stand back, you hairy ape!
It's...
It's nothing but a packet of letters.
Letters, what did I tell you?
That's why he was going through the code book.
Letters are worse than bombs sometimes.
Where else would spies get their orders from if it wasn't from letters?
What orders would he be getting, do you suppose?
Open it and find out.
The name written here is,
"Thomas Fenwick."
That's no more his name than Smith.
Schmidt, that's this guy's real tag.
You don't suppose he'd be using his own name, do you?
It's a foreign postmark by the looks of it.
Look at the stamp.
B-E-R...
Berlin! I knew them letters was from Germany.
Berlin, by devil!
Read it, Drisk.
I'm not much of a hand at reading, but it begins, "Tom, darling."
"Tom, darling"?
- Read it out louder. - Yeah, out loud.
"Tom, darling,
"Clive said he'd seen you at Gibraltar
"before you sailed for Malta.
"It wasn't anything he said, but his manners seemed queer,
"and I was terribly uneasy
"until your letter arrived.
"There is only one thing, Tom, darling,
"can wreck our lives,
"and that is this black shadow."
- Black shadow?
- Code word.
Sure, go on. Go on.
"Whenever you're tempted, dearest man,
"think of those who love you.
"Of Tommy and Betsy
"and of your own Elizabeth."
- Elizabeth?
- That's how it's signed.
- Queer. - What does it mean then?
By the Holy, here's one addressed to this ship.
- Read it. - "S. S. Glencairn."
That was five months ago in Montevideo.
The writing's bad in this one.
Same hand, only a little shaky.
"Tom, darling,
"it's only from your chance meeting with Harry
"that I know where to reach you.
"I know now that you hadn't stopped
"drinking.
"That you couldn't stop.
"That you lied about it.
"But I know you lied to give me peace of mind.
"Always hoping you could fight it out
"and make it come true.
"My heart broke at the thought of your trial,
"and I nearly died when your letter finally came
"like a note from the grave
"telling me that, for my own sake,
"you would never return to England.
"Dear, dear man,
"loss of a commission is not loss of life.
"There is no disgrace we can't go through together.
"I refuse to tell the children, as you asked,
"that their father is dead.
"He'll never be dead to me because I love him.
"Oh, Tom.
"Tom, you must come back to us.
"Elizabeth.
"His Majesty, the King,
"has been graciously pleased to authorize
"the issue of the..."
What the devil am I reading that for?
Get the hell out of here, you black lugs!
- Swine! - By devil!
Go on. Get yourselves a wink of sleep.
All's well, Smitty?
All's well, Ole.
Ole?
Axel?
Yeah?
Do you not smell the land?
The sweet smell of Ireland.
The fields and the forests, the green hills.
But that's England that way.
Did I ask you?
Make anything of it, Mister?
They're flying above the clouds.
I suppose it must be our lads coming in for patrol.
Machine guns, bombs, bullets!
Hash, you marmalade!
By devil, I quit!
Quick! Hide! Quick!
Number Two lifeboat.
Give me a hand to lower this lifeboat. Clear the shocks.
Sure, Smitty.
Veer your ship. Break your course, man. Break your course.
Mrs. Fenwick.
Well, Smitty got home.
He's gone.
Gone.
Smitty's gone.
There you are, the last penny.
Put your mark there.
He can write, Mister.
Wanna sign up for the next voyage, Olsen?
No, sir. I go home this time.
- Thank you. - Is that all?
Aloysius Driscoll.
Aloysius Driscoll.
I know you men will want another berth when you've spent your money.
So if anybody wants to sign on for the next voyage before you go ashore, you can do so now.
So speak up.
Right. That's all.
I'm signing on, sir.
All right.
They'll be back, all right.
All except Olsen, sir.
Olsen.
Well, we'll see.
Come on now, lads. Shake a leg. It's the last I wanna see of this rusty...
There, by golly, you don't spend that money. That's for farm.
Ole!
Come on! Hurry up!
- Come on! - Come on!
The first thing we do is put Ole on his boat.
- But first, we go to the ticket office. - Ticket office!
Ticket office is the word, and I'll show you the way, and then we'll go to Joe's Place.
And after that, we...
Who the devil are you, you little pish-posh?
Nick is the name, shipmate.
Nick is the name, mates, and I'm glad to meet you one and all.
Now this here is a card for Joe's Place.
Lovely dancing girls, bow-wow, no chance of being robbed, and the best drinks in town.
Drinks?
There'll be no drinks till we put Ole on his boat!
That's right, Drisk.
You're making a mistake, shipmates! Best spot in town for a drink.
Nice girls to dance with...
Any of you shellbacks looking for a berth?
What ship is that?
Amindra.
Sailing tonight for Valparaiso. We need another seaman.
The Amindra. The Amindra!
A starvation tub, if ever I saw one.
Rotten grub, work night and day, and your skull split open if you open your mouth!
No wonder you can't get no crew, you bluenose...
- Sling your hook! - Stay away from me, I'm warning you.
Come on, Drisk!
I'll catch up with you one of these days, you bluenose blaggart!
Amindra. Amindra.
Svensk Engelsk. Yeah, that's it.
In you go, Ole. In you go, and buy your ticket.
Well, now, that's settled.
There's Ole's ticket!
Here, I take Ole's ticket.
By golly!
There, you got money for farm, and stick ticket for Stockholm, and you don't lose.
Now, you're all right!
And now, lads, we've got a little time on our hands.
Time, mates?
The pilot's aboard, yo-heave-ho!
Anchor's away, and we'll steer a course for Joe's Place.
And just to show that my heart's in the right place,
I'll tell you what I'll do, mates. I'll stand a drink all round.
Drink! Preposterous!
There'll be no drink till that one's safe aboard.
That's the gospel truth.
Of course, a glass of beer maybe to wish Ole on his way.
And drink a toast to Smitty.
And Yank.
Smitty and Yank.
Yeah, Yank...
That's a grand idea.
You know, mate, when I seen you chaps coming ashore, my heart was touched, thinking of the way our sailor lads is suffering these days.
Hearts of oak, I said.
Axel!
Sing us another one.
By golly, that's good beer! You want a drink?
Ole, good luck to you!
Ole!
One glass of beer.
- The boat! - The boat!
The boat! The boat!
- The boat! - Wish! Wish!
Do you hear it? Do you hear what they're playing?
Tipperary.
But it's a grand night to be whirling about in some fine...
Yeah, but don't you...
One dance! Just one dance!
Come on. Come on.
Sorry, you civilians can't go in there. That's for these lads going off to war.
Going off to war!
Is there any place on land or sea where there is no war?
That's it. Move along. Get off the street.
Best place to be during a blackout.
Blackout. Blackout. Blackout.
Blackout.
Everywhere people stumbling in the dark.
Is there to be no more light in the world?
Is there no place in this dark land where a man who's drunk can find a decent bit of fun?
What have I been telling you all evening, mate?
Don't let them get your egg out. Come on with me to Joe's Place.
Lots of lovely girls and no blooming copper telling you what you can do or what you can't do.
Devil take me, but I remember this place.
Ship ahoy, me hearties! Happy to see you home again safe and sound.
Ship ahoy.
Ship ahoy, is it?
So it's you, you blaggart!
Five, six years ago,
I was robbed of my last bob in this place in me sleeping.
Devil stiffen you!
If you come any of your tricks over me this time, I'll...
You're mistaken, mate. This is an honest place, this is.
Oh, yes, and you're a blushing angel, I suppose.
Well, no matter. It's past and gone forgot.
I'm not a man to be holding hard feelings my first night ashore.
- And me drunk as a log. - Quite right. You've got my vote.
What's it gonna be? What's your pleasure? What'll it be?
- Irish whiskey! - Same here.
Come on! Cut it out, will you?
Axel, my ticket! Where's my ticket?
In your coat, lad. In your coat. There it is.
Large as life.
You couldn't lose that without losing the coat itself.
Well, we go soon, Drisk. I don't wanna miss boat to Stockholm.
Sure, lad, and fine shipmates we'd be if we didn't see you on your way, but you've ladies of time!
- Sure! - Quiet down!
Aye, I'll treat you a toast, lads!
May the devil burn that black Scot of a Mate.
- Yeah! I'll drink to that! - What will you have, mate?
He'll have a pint of beer. And you know who'll pay for it? I will.
Now, it won't do you the least bit of harm, mate.
Why, you're the strongest in the whole lot.
Here, stand up. Come on. Don't be afraid.
There you are. That's the kind of fo'c's'le on hand that skippers is looking for.
He'll have just a pint of beer, Joe, on me.
No, he won't have a pint on you!
He won't have a pint on anybody! You stop talk like that!
Oh, I just take one.
Ole, hold that.
All right.
You just take one drink, and I hurt you!
I agree with the square-head. Nothing for Ole.
All right, I just take ginger beer.
- What? - He say ginger beer.
He wants ginger beer!
- Ginger beer! - Oh, ginger beer.
What devils...
Well, I was just telling Joe the ladies is coming over to have a drink with you.
And what lovely, what beautiful, what seductivity.
Ladies, if I may?
Hello, mates.
Ship ahoy!
Provocative! Tantalizing.
Have a good voyage?
A rotten voyage, but never mind that.
My name's Freda. Hers is Kate. Hers is Meg.
You're welcome, as the saying is.
Are you gonna buy us a whit?
I like them fat!
Come on, square-head. Play us a tune, an Irish tune.
Would you care to dance?
No, I go now.
Where you going?
Goodbye, Axel.
I'll think you don't like me if you don't come back.
Well, you is wrong. I do like you.
Why won't you come back then?
Won't you come in and have a pint with me?
I go home. I catch boat.
Well, you don't wanna go without a sweetheart to say goodbye to, do you?
Please.
All right, I just take a ginger beer.
Won't you sit down? Over here.
All right, shipmates, come on out the back room.
Everything is free and easy there, and we got a lovely gramophone, and the cops can't hear us.
Now tell me something about yourself.
- In Norway? - No.
- Denmark. - No.
- Then it must be Sweden. - Ja.
Ain't that funny? I was born there, too.
- Where, Miss Freda? - In Sweden.
- Do you speak Swedish? - Oh, no.
You see, my old man and woman come here to England when I was only a baby.
I'm an orphan, you know.
And they was speaking English before I was old enough to learn.
So I never knew Swedish. I wished I had.
No place like your home, I says.
Ja.
I leave home when I was kid. Now, I don't leave no more.
I got all the sea I want for my whole life.
What did you do before you was a sailor?
I work on farm till I'm 16.
And we lived... My mother and brother live.
My father is dead.
We live on farm just little way outside Stockholm.
I got plenty money now.
Sewn in pocket. Two years' pay.
How clever.
You'll be getting married, too, I suppose. You got a sweetheart?
Oh, I don't know, Miss Freda, I think so. I...
Well, I...
What's your hurry? You haven't bought me my drink yet.
I only takes a drop of gin now and again.
For my health.
A drop of gin, Joe, if you please.
With a beer chaser.
You hear that, Joe?
A drop of gin and a beer chaser for her ladyship.
Right-o.
Now, come on, sailor. Come on. You can't let the little lady drink all alone.
- Well, I... - Please.
Now, come on. Sit down. Sit down.
You got a new matey, you know. Here, what you gonna have?
Well, then I take a little ginger beer.
- Ginger beer. - Small one.
Small ginger beer. You shall have it.
No! No.
Tell me something about your old lady.
Your mother, she won't be half glad to see you, will she?
Does she know you're coming?
No, I thought I just give her a surprise.
She must be old, ain't she?
You know, Miss Freda, I don't see my mother in...
Must be 10 years. Oh, I write to her once in a while.
She writes many times. My brother, he writes, too.
My mother say in all her letters, "You come right home!"
And I write back always, "I come soon."
And I mean all time to go at end of voyage.
But I come ashore. I take one drink. I take two drinks.
I ship away for another voyage. Something always happens.
Here we are.
And I took the liberty of having one myself.
Skol.
- Hear her. Skol! - Skol!
More beer!
Well, this time I go home.
I feel homesick for farm and to see my people again.
Just like little boy, I feel homesick.
My mother, she gets old.
Ship ahoy! Ship ahoy!
- Can I keep the parrot? - Oh, you...
What devil's trick is this?
What kind of... Where's Ole?
Who?
The big lad, Ole!
Oh, him.
Oh, he left on a steamer. He said he couldn't wait.
And he told me to say goodbye.
Ole go home.
The big lug made it.
Ole's gone home to Stockholm.
We still have time to go and say bon voyage. Come on.
Before you go, how about a farewell drink on the house?
- Good idea. Good idea. Good idea.
Ole's gone.
What'll you have, whiskey?
Irish whiskey.
That's a queer thing for Ole to be doing.
If Ole's gone to the steamer, Drisk, we got time to catch him.
Well, we've come to see him off anyway.
Well, come on now. Sling your hooks!
- Shall we go? - Goodbye, mate!
- Happy trip. - Goodbye!
- Goodbye. Goodbye. - Goodbye.
It's not in my nature to feel unkindly toward any man, to be holding a grudge inside of me when I might let bygones be bygones.
- Thank you, mate. - So feeling in a merciful mood toward you
- when I might never see you again... - Now.
...it would be a hard thing to have on me.
Of course, it would. Of course.
So...
Ship ahoy! Ship ahoy! Ship ahoy!
Excuse me, mates, but you haven't got it quite right. It goes something like this.
- Where's Ole?
- Where's Ole?
- What did you do to him? - Where's Ole?
Driscoll.
Yes, Driscoll, you...
- Ole! - Ole!
Come on!
Quick!
Ole! Ole! Ole!
Give me...
Come on. Go on. Get him off here.
Hurry up! Hurry up, there. Hurry up!
All clear!
Take him forward.
Drisk.
Where's Ole?
Ole go home.
- Good. - Yeah. Ole go home to Stockholm.
Where's Drisk? What happened to Driscoll?
Drisk gone.
- Gone? Gone where?
- Amindra.
He sail on that devil ship Amindra.
He's gone.
He's gone.
Gentlemen, Nazi motorized divisions are already massed on our frontiers.
Unless a miracle happens, we shall be invaded.
This factory will be one of their first objectives.
I have special instructions here from the minister of the interior.
''In no circumstances must Herr Bomasch or his G.K. armor plating... be allowed to pass into Nazi hands.''
But my work is not yet completed.
The tests that you have made were good enough to show its possibilities.
Isn't that understating it?
If it's successful, it will revolutionize defensive warfare.
And it is a revolution that we do not wish to have brought about by the Third Reich.
-Then I am to leave the country.
-As soon as the Nazi invasion starts.
I have here passports for yourself and your daughter.
Arrangements have been made for you to carry on your work in another country.
Where, you will be told when the time comes.
I have made out lists —
Ours?
No. Theirs.
If we resist German protection, Prague will be bombed.
Protection. Protection from what?
Give me a direct line to the Ministry of the Interior, at once!
What?
The minister left 10 minutes ago for the Central Radio Station.
The German command has given the order to march.
At this moment, Nazi troops are streaming across our frontiers.
In our present defenseless condition... resistance is worse than useless.
Citizens of Czechoslovakia...
We must bear the trials that lie ahead... with fortitude and courage.
Be of good heart.
And remember — long live Czechoslovakia!
But will the British government give me facilities?
Everything is arranged. You will be met at Croydon.
Here are the details. Now, you haven't a minute to lose.
The plane leaves the airfield in half an hour, and it will be the last.
-But, uh, will you be there?
-I must stay.
Axel, your daughter.
Is that you, Anna?
You have heard?
Listen, dear. I don't want to alarm you, but we have to leave the country at once.
Go to the airport.
I will be waiting for you.
Immediately. Do you understand?
Yes. Yes, at once. Where are we going?
England?
Yes, of course.
-What's happening, Miss Anna?
-Martha, I've got to leave at once.
Help me put some things in a bag.
Anna Bomasch, you are under arrest.
-We cannot wait any longer!
-Please, another moment!
My daughter was leaving at once.
But the city's occupied already. We must go!
Away! Come on!
Schnell! Schnell!
Marsch.
Aufschliessen!
Halt!
Turn right.
Edward Klein, for laziness.
12 lashes.
My heart will never stand it, Herr Doctor.
-Heart's fit.
-I have been under treatment for —
Take him away. Next man.
Karl Marsen, for insubordination.
20 lashes.
Good for twice the number by the look of him.
You will soon learn that it's better to keep your mouth shut... and to do as you are told.
Thank you. I have no wish to become a Nazi.
We shall also teach you that insolence does not pay.
With the aid of those pillars of Nazi culture — the whip and the jackboot.
-Silence!
-I shall say what I like!
You hate the truth... because, in the end, it will destroy you and your bankrupt philosophy.
You will perish because you have nothing to offer... because you can't forever replace tolerance and decency... with brute force, because you —
Stand away from him.
Get back to your work.
Better leave me.
Mmm?
Halt!
Get along. No talking.
Good Samaritan.
I wanted to thank you for yesterday.
The swine!
Don't look at me. We shall be seen.
Why did they send you here?
Oh.
I'm a desperate character.
I had a little school on the Sudeten border.
I was ordered to abolish our language and to teach in German... by an illiterate Nazi group leader.
So here I am.
Shh.
-And you?
-My father escaped to England.
I almost went back with him.
-Back?
-I was at school there.
They arrested me to find out where he was hiding... and because I couldn't tell them —
That's all.
England.
Well, good luck to him.
I have been a fool. I —
I should have held my tongue and-and waited.
-We shan't always be here.
-No?
Somehow, I'm going to join my father.
How?
-Well, we have friends outside.
-Yes.
But between them and us —
There must be a way.
Past searchlights, machine guns, barbed wire?
I should take any risk if I thought there was a chance.
But there is none.
There isn't one of us who doesn't lie awake —
-Keep your mouths shut!
You know the order!
Get back, you. I told —
Silence.
What is it?
Do you know him?
He studied with me for a job in the civil bureau.
He might help us.
-But isn't he a German?
-Yes.
From the Sudetenland.
When it was occupied by Germany, he was desperate.
I gave him the advice.
Become a good Nazi, Paul.
Join the party... and wait.
Then you think that —
Yes.
Now there may be a chance.
-What's wrong up there?
-It's fused!
It's all right!
-You should be asleep.
-Karl, what's that noise?
-That's the Goodwin lightship, miss.
-We should be in England in an hour or two.
But it'll be light then.
You don't mean we're going ashore without any passports in broad daylight?
In broad daylight!
Why not?
Come on. Only a shilling.
-Aye, aye, knock it. Turn it up. What's the idea?
-Oh, I'm so sorry.
Think you're the Mauretania?
I might have had a Lillian Gish on the end of that.
-I'm very sorry indeed.
-All right. Granted, me ol' cock.
-Have you caught anything?
-New eels.
Oh! That's a night fish. You've been out in a ketch.
Not like me — fishing to keep away from the old woman.
-Where do we change?
-The beach.
-And then London?
-Yes.
There I shall go to see a friend of my family.
He fled to England last September. He'll help us.
He's living at a place called Hampstead. You've heard of it?
Karl, if you only knew how glad I am to be back here... where people can still laugh and be happy.
Come away, Alfie. If you're not falling in something, you're dragging in something.
Go on.
-Good evening.
-Uh, good evening.
-I should like to see Dr. Fredericks.
-Have you an appointment?
No, but, uh, if you would give him my name. It is Marsen.
Karl Marsen.
-Well, will you come in, please?
-Thank you.
Now, if you will take this to Gilby's, the opticians.
They're just around the corner.
If you mention my name, they will make up your little girl's glasses at a reduced charge.
Thank you, Doctor.
And don't worry. With care, she will grow out of it.
-Thank you, Doctor. Good night.
-Good night.
There's a gentleman to see you, Doctor, a Mr. Marsen.
Marsen?
Oh, very well. Show him in.
-The doctor will see you now.
-Thank you.
Good luck.
Mr. Marsen.
-Good evening.
-How do you do, Doctor?
I was given your name. I'm suffering from an, uh, eyestrain and should like a test.
-Headaches and so forth?
-Hmm, yes.
If you will be good enough to sit in this chair, please?
Thank you.
-Warm this evening, isn't it?
-Rather.
I hear there may be a storm brewing.
Now, will you read the top line, please?
K, M, S...
Q, R, Y.
And now the line underneath.
M, O, 2... 6, 7, 3, G.
I don't think that is quite right. Will you repeat it, please?
M, O, 2... 6, 7, 3, G.
--Heil Hitler.
--Heil Hitler.
Well?
I have to report that on instructions from Gestapo headquarters...
I successfully made contact with the woman Bomasch... in Concentration Camp Number Four, Reichsprotektorat of Bohemia.
I escaped with her, as arranged, on the 27th of July... and came ashore this morning at 11:15, from the freighter Stovendam.
We are staying at an apartment house... at 124 Paddington Lane, Marylebone.
Good. She has, of course, made no attempt to locate her father.
No. I am awaiting your instructions.
This is all we know.
Bomasch is working for the British admiralty. Where, we have no idea.
He is certainly well hidden and well guarded.
-Therefore, we must move cautiously.
-Understood, sir.
So do not appear too eager.
Impress upon her that you are aliens and must move carefully.
Suggest that she places an advertisement to this effect... in the personal column of the London Times... signed perhaps with some nickname which her father will know at once.
You will see that that advertisement is repeated daily until it is answered.
When that happens, you will report to me instantly.
-You understand?
-Yes, sir.
That is all. Heil Hitler.
--Heil Hitler!
I see that fellow Ribbentrop's going to Moscow.
Hmm. So did Napoleon.
Miss Bomasch, you're wanted on the phone.
Nice time of night to ring up, I must say.
-Who is it?
-Oh, he didn't say.
Hello?
Yes, I'm Anna Bomasch.
In the Times, yes. Who is it?
Yes, I'm alone. Who is it, please?
I can't answer questions. Now please listen carefully.
At the post office in Prairie Street, a letter is waiting for you... containing a railway ticket.
Go to the destination on the ticket, and when you get to the town... ask for a man named Gus Bennett.
You've got the name?
Gus Bennett.
-Yes, but who do I ask?
-Everyone there knows Gus Bennett.
You say nothing of this to anyone. That is most important.
Hello?
-Yes?
-It's Anna. May I come in?
Yes, come in.
Karl, I've just heard. Somebody telephoned.
-We found him.
-Where?
-I don't know yet.
-But, uh, what did he say?
Karl, I'd love to tell you, but whoever it was said I wasn't to say a word to anyone.
-Oh.
-I don't mean you're just anyone.
-Of course you're not, but —
-Anna, I —
I would much rather you didn't tell me.
We don't know what your father is doing, and it's probably right you should take precautions.
There's no one in the world I'd rather confide in.
I don't know what I'd have done if it hadn't been for you.
No.
-You are happy now?
-Mm-hmm.
Well, that's all that matters.
Good night, Karl.
-? (man singing)
-I'm looking for Mr. Gus Bennett. I was told I'd find him here.
Oh, he's along here, all right.
You hear a warbling note like an air raid siren?
Well, that's him singing.
-? Only love can cheer the day ?
-Over there?
Churns out the same moldy songs from 9:00 in the morning.
A human barrel organ, he is.
-? Lots in life may be denied ? -?
? But hearts can laugh ?
? When love's inside ?
? For only love can lead the way ?
? As time rolls on and on ?
The song of the century!
When ''Home Sweet Home'' and ''Annie Laurie'' are forgotten, this song will live on.
Now, madam, only the price of a stick of rock.
Sixpence, sir. The ballad of the age. ''Only Love Can Lead the Way.''
Here, buy a copy for the sergeant major. Thank you, gentlemen! Thank you!
Anyone else want to buy a copy of this haunting melody?
How would you like to be haunted for a sixpence, miss?
-Mr.
Gus Bennett? -In the flesh.
You want me to autograph it?
I'll throw that in.
-I'm Anna Bomasch.
-How do you do?
Don't go away, ladies and gentlemen!
I'm not gonna sing again yet.
-I was told to come and see you, Mr. Bennett.
-Hmm?
Who by?
-I don't know.
-Is this a gag?
Well, somebody phoned me. They said you'd have news of my father.
Your father?
Never heard of him. Somebody's pulling your leg.
''Only Love Can Lead the Way.'' A tonic so far.
We give the tonic. You provide the ''so far.''
Thank you, madam. Hey, don't go away. I'm just going to tear off another number.
Then we'll have a talk.
I'm now going to sing the sentimental song hit of the year.
They say the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world... but, believe me, it's songs like this that fill it.
? It's true ?
? Oh, what it does to me to know it's true ?
? She loves me ?
Are you — Are you sure it was Gus Bennett they said?
-Yes, I'm certain.
-Your father's not in the song business?
-No.
-Well, it's beyond me. How did you lose him?
-He escaped.
-Escaped?
You mean he's still at large?
-I-I mean, you haven't seen him since?
You see, I was in a concentration camp.
-Were you really?
Where? -Near Prague.
Prague.
-You here by yourself?
-Yes.
-Anyone know you're here?
-No.
Would you like another one of these?
No, thank you.
Alfie?
I don't understand it. It's extraordinary.
Well, it amounts to this.
You don't know my father... you don't know anything about him, and you can't help me.
Is that him?
Father!
Anna!
Here it is — Brightbourne, a health resort.
But I hardly think that Herr Bomasch is there for his health.
You notice across the bay is the Dartland naval base.
Reports says he's been there three times in the last week.
Probably conducting experiments, sir.
Precisely. We can't afford to delay a moment longer.
There's another reason for haste.
Any day now, Poland may provoke us into invading her in self-defense.
England will not stand by Poland.
We have the personal assurance of Herr Von Ribbentrop as to that.
Hmm. So I understand.
Nevertheless, instruct Fredericks that we are putting arrangements in hand at once.
Very good, sir.
? You nonchalantly go around ?
? Completely unaware ?
? It's just another ordinary day ?
? You meet a sweet who sweeps you off your feet ?
? Your heart skips a beat and runs away ?
? You can't recall a tender thought to show how much you care ?
?
You can't think of a single thing to say ?
? You'll meet, so meek You'll talk, but you don't speak ?
? Your heart skips a beat and runs away ?
? It may be Tuesday or Sunday ?
? Thursday or Monday ?
? Love never warns you at all ?
-Is the coffee ready?
-It won't be a minute.
-Thank you, dear. -? (woman continues, indistinct)
--Oh, hello.
-Hello there.
-Come to see Father?
No.
-Want some?
-Thank you.
-Where did you get that from?
-Post office stopped it.
-Why?
-I gave them instructions.
What have my private letters to do with you?
A postmark's a dangerous thing.
-This letter's to a friend of mine.
-British?
-No.
-Refugee?
I'm not going to be cross-examined.
I must remind you that the government pay me a wage — small but regular — to look after your father.
It's obviously not small enough.
You don't suppose I'd write to anybody I couldn't trust.
Why, if it wasn't for Karl, I wouldn't be here.
What did you say?
-He escaped with me.
-But you never told me.
-I told my father.
-But not me.
If I didn't, it's simply because Karl is an alien without a passport.
He was afraid he might be deported.
-Known him long?
-No. What are you doing?
Just want to check up on him.
Have you ever heard of an organized escape?
-Organized?
-To lead them to your father.
But that's fantastic. Karl doesn't even know where I am.
Are you sure of that?
-Of course. I told no one.
-Good.
Honestly, I don't want to throw a monkey wrench into the romance.
Thank you. I appreciate that you're inspired by the highest motives... and that you'll go to any lengths to pursue them.
-Any lengths.
-Even to exhibiting yourself in public as a singer.
Well, nature endowed me with a gift, and I just accepted it. That's all.
It's a pity it didn't endow you with a voice.
Nothing that happened to me in that concentration camp... was quite as dreadful as listening to you day after day... singing those appalling songs.
With those few words, you've knocked the bottom out of my entire existence.
A pity I only knocked it.
-Mr. Bomasch about?
-Yes, he is.
Admiral Baldwin sends his compliments.
He'd like Mr. Bomasch to have dinner with him this evening.
-And his daughter.
-Hmm. I'll tell him.
Uh, just a minute. Didn't Admiral Baldwin leave for the Mediterranean last Tuesday?
No. He's aboard the flagship lying off Dartland.
-But I understood that —
Isn't he going too far out for Dartland?
Sorry to barge in. I say, Charles, the wife's just phoned.
-I understand you're coming over to tea on Sunday.
-Yes, so I believe.
Well, she wants you to remind Beryl to bring some recipe book — pickling walnuts or something.
-Oh, yes. Will do.
-Right.
-Oh, hello, Randall. How are you?
-Hello. Hi.
We were just discussing the Bomasch affair.
Oh, yes, you slipped up rather badly there, didn't you?
-Yes, I —
-Well, it wasn't exactly his fault.
We ought to have known about Karl Marsen.
The War Office has been stinking about him.
They take the view that this armor plating of Bomasch's... will make all the difference in the next war.
Probably nothing of the sort, but, well, there you are.
And by tonight, Bomasch will be in Berlin... where they won't lose any time before putting the screws on the poor devil.
Tomorrow night?
That means he won't be at the admiralty until, let's see — Saturday morning.
That's about it. Why?
Twenty-four, maybe 48 hours.
Why?
What are you driving at?
Well, they got him out of England. Why shouldn't I get him back?
But that's quite impossible.
Why?
I know my way about. I was three years in Berlin.
-Drinking lager.
-Mmm. Vodka now, isn't it?
What about the Polish situation?
Germany may march at any moment. You know what that means.
I shall be back before then. Well, sir?
Well, you know perfectly well I can't give you permission to do it.
And the fact that you make the request at all shows you're not yourself.
-Don't you think so, Gaskin?
-Oh, well, I —
I quite agree with you.
Now, I suggest you take a week's sick leave... to enable you to get a complete change of air, hmm?
Thank you, sir. I understand. I think it might be very good for both of us.
Mm-hmm. Now, I expect you'd like to have a little chat about it.
Yes, I would, sir.
Oh, well, uh, Charles, you won't forget about that recipe, will you?
No, no. I'll remember.
Now look here.
I don't know what your plans are... but I expect you'll want a few letters of introduction.
Mm-hmm.
Reichssender K?
nigs Wusterhausen calling.
Early this morning, the Polish hoards attacked Germany.
The führer immediately gave orders to our glorious army to invade Poland... and to destroy these intolerable aggressors... of peace-loving Germany.
Naval High Command, Herr Major.
-How can I reach you?
-I'll ring you tonight.
I'll be waiting. Good luck.
All identity cards.
All identity cards.
All identity cards to be shown.
All identity cards.
All identity cards to be shown.
Identity card?
Come on, come on, come on.
I've worked here for 10 years. You Gestapo fellows must want a job.
-All right, all right.
-This is a fine country to live in.
-Hey. What's that?
-Nothing.
-Name. Department.
-Schwab. Records. Intelligence.
-Report that man.
-Excellent, Officer.
While we have men like you at home, we have nothing to fear. Nothing.
Oh, I have an appointment with Commander Kampfeldt.
-Where can I find him?
-Second floor, sir.
Thank you.
This is a very grave matter, very grave.
It has just been reported to me that you've been heard expressing sentiments... hostile to the fatherland.
-What, me, sir?
-What is it?
Major Herzoff to see you. He asked me to give you this.
Can't you see I'm engaged?
I warn you, Schwab, such treasonable conduct will lead you to a concentration camp.
But, sir, what did I say?
You were distinctly heard to remark, ''This is a fine country to live in.''
Oh, no, sir. There's some mistake.
No, what I said was, ''This is a fine country to live in.''
Huh?
-You sure?
-Yes, sir.
Hmm. I see.
Well, in future, don't make remarks that can be taken two ways.
-Much wiser not to talk politics at all.
-Yes, sir.
-You may go.
-Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.
This is a fine country to live in.
This is a fine country to live in.
This is a bloody awful country to live in.
Shall I show Major Herzoff in, sir?
-Uh, yes, yes.
-Yes, sir.
Please.
Major Herzoff.
-Heil Hitler.
-Heil Hitler.
-Sit down, Major.
-Thank you.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
''This is to introduce to you Major Ulrich Herzoff... of the Corps of Engineers.
Major Herzoff is in Berlin on an important technical mission... for which he requires admiralty assistance.
I am sure, my dear Kampfeldt, that you will give him your best cooperation.
Heil Hitler.'' Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
I wish these War Office fellows would learn to write properly.
Signature might be anything.
Whose is it?
Well, I have no idea.
As usual, I was taken from one office to another.
-I suppose it couldn't be Sardvitz.
-Sardvitz?
Or did he go in the purge?
-I can't remember.
-I believe he did.
Hmm. Whoever he was, he spoke very highly of you.
He did?
Might be Meidvidtz.
Not very likely though.
However, the important thing is, what can I do for you?
I want to refer to certain technical evidence... given before the Naval Heavy Armaments 1935 Committee.
If you will let me have a report of the copy, Commander.
Certainly. It will take only a moment. I have my own filing system here.
A copy of the Naval Heavy Armaments 1935 Committee's report.
-Have you been in Berlin long, Major?
-No. I only left the Siegfried line last Tuesday.
Really?
How is it there?
Things are pretty hectic, I expect.
Pumping night and day.
I was there in a consultative capacity.
Steel fortifications. You possibly have heard.
Oh, yes, yes. Major Herzoff, of course.
Looks rather like Stuckner.
But I believe he is doing diplomatic work in the Balkans.
-And who is not?
I'm afraid we haven't a copy of the 1935 report, sir.
-What's that?
-We have one of '34, but not '35.
Are you sure there was a '35 committee?
I sat in it myself as army liaison officer.
I beg your pardon.
Very well, very well.
It's these fellows at the top. They forget to send copies on.
Perhaps the construction department might be able to help.
The very thing.
They might have one. I'll ring them at once.
-Oh, I'm sorry —
-No trouble at all.
Commander Prada.
I have with me Major Ulrich Herzoff of the Corps of Engineers.
He is well known for his splendid technical achievements on our west wall... as you're no doubt aware.
He will be greatly obliged if you can give him some assistance.
You'll see him at once?
Thank you, sir.
1935, you said. I guess I could get hold of a copy for you.
Now, Commander Prada, you may be able to help me more directly.
-You know, I just left the Siegfried line.
-Mm-hmm.
So Kampfeldt said.
How is everything?
The Krupp's armor plating is the trouble.
Confidentially, that's why I am in Berlin.
Do you realize that the steel used by the Czechs is better than anything we have got?
Mm-hmm.
So I've heard.
But surely, now that we control the Harska works —
Not enough.
We let the only man who counted there slip through our fingers.
-Bomasch.
-Yes.
I knew Axel Bomasch personally.
I was present at the first gunnery test of his G.K. plating.
Incredible results. Where is he?
Working for Britain.
But if we can't trace this 1935 report —
One moment, Major.
You will be surprised to hear that Bomasch is no longer in England.
What?
He was brought back to Germany only a few hours ago.
In fact, he's in this building now.
But this completely alters my plans.
Perhaps you can arrange for me to see Herr Bomasch at once.
I'm afraid it's impossible. He's with the controller.
Surely there's no harm in my asking him a few questions.
It's beyond my province, Major.
I'll pass you on to Captain Viengarten, but frankly I don't think it will get you any further.
The controller's office is rather like the kingdom of heaven... and, if anything, a little more exclusive.
But you are no longer living in a decadent democracy... ruled by a pack of raving intellectuals!
This is the Third Reich, and the führer does not tolerate... stupid, insolent obstinacy!
You have been asked to work for Germany, Herr Bomasch, and you will.
Can't you leave him alone?
You've bullied and shouted at him ever since we got here!
-He's had no sleep!
-He must agree!
Can I have another word with him, sir?
As you please.
Anna.
It's useless for your father to resist like this.
You must persuade him. You will both be given reasonable freedom.
Freedom here?
In time, you will see things the way I do... the way everyone in Germany does.
I'm not a German.
Germany is as much your country as it is ours now.
We don't hate the Czechs. We only wish to protect them.
As you're protecting the people of Poland?
You have been too long in Britain, listening to their smug hypocrisy!
If I listened to hypocrisy in Britain, it was not from the British.
I was doing my duty... as a citizen of the Reich and a subject of the führer... for whose sacred mission no sacrifice is too great.
That sounds rather like something you learnt from a book.
For years, you've had this sort of thing drilled into you until it's all you know or care about!
You're a fanatic with a set of stupid, fixed ideas!
If you hadn't made me hate you more than I thought I could possibly hate anybody...
I think I should feel sorry for you.
You have expressed yourself very clearly, Fraulein Bomasch.
You will be placed in a concentration camp until your father comes to his senses.
-Must you drag my daughter into this?
-It rests with you, Herr Bomasch.
Hello?
What, here?
Very good.
Admiral Hassinger is on his way up.
The Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Count Hassinger.
Come in, my dear fellow.
Come in.
Strasse, let me present Major Herzoff of the Corps of Engineers.
I expect you have heard of him.
The man behind the Siegfried line, eh, Herzoff?
Only one of the men, sir.
The führer is responsible for the line as he is responsible for everything.
Well, what progress?
You remember me, Herr Bomasch. I did not expect to see you again here.
And you, Fraulein Bomasch. I see you have not forgotten.
It must be... four years.
Major Herzoff is preparing a highly confidential report on armor plating.
He has been on several missions to Prague.
-He met Bomasch there.
-Just one moment, sir.
Marsen, conduct Herr Bomasch and his daughter into the next room.
-Mr. Bomasch.
-Maybe we shall meet again, later.
I thought it unwise to speak in front of Bomasch.
So far, we've made no impression on him.
I do not agree.
He looks 10 years older.
My orders are to obtain quick results.
At the Reich, we are rather inclined to believe... that the knuckle-duster is the best diplomatic weapon.
Do I understand that you question?
I question nothing. I am an army officer.
Personally, I do not follow any of this at all.
Bomasch is not the man to be bullied into cooperation, sir.
Well, what do you suggest?
I knew Fraulein Bomasch in Prague.
She has a great influence with her father and is the one person who can make him change his mind.
Oh, Marsen here has tried that, but she refused to listen.
He is largely responsible for tracing Bomasch in England... completely outwitting the British military intelligence.
So, may I express a soldier's admiration... for one who can carry out his mission under the very eyes of the enemy secret service?
Thank you, sir.
But if I may say so, I hardly think the captain... is a suitable person to influence the lady.
And who do you think would be more suitable?
Why, uh, myself, for instance.
-You?
-Why not?
Herzoff was very friendly with her in Prague, you know.
A little more than friendly.
You saw the way she looked at me when I came in.
Oh, yes, of course. Seems to me you are a bit of a dog, Herzoff.
A technician, Admiral.
One does not talk about these things... but I think if I were to spend a few hours alone with her...
I might induce her to reason with her father.
Oh. What do you think about that, Strasse?
I cannot promise, mind you.
Four years is a long time.
It seems to me it is worth attempting.
After all, the business is urgent, Strasse.
It is indeed, sir.
You really believe that you could influence a girl in a matter of hours?
-Shall we say overnight?
Knowing Fraulein Bomasch, sir, I doubt whether even his qualities... will make any impression on her.
-You aren't acquainted with my qualities.
-Strasse, we'll let him try it.
No harm done if he doesn't succeed. Leave all the arrangements to me.
This requires a knowledge of maneuvers. Come along, Herzoff.
You may be right, my dear. Bennett may be trying to help us.
But why have they brought us to this hotel, provided you with clothes?
It doesn't make sense to me.
Well, Bennett's behind it, obviously. He's organized the whole thing.
How?
Well, how did he manage to get into the German admiralty as a Nazi officer?
But I don't see how he can get us away from here, Anna.
Oh, Father, don't worry about it. Perhaps you'd better go to bed now, eh?
We'll find out what it's all about in the morning.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Good night, my dear.
Come in.
-Fraulein Bomasch?
-Yes.
Thank you.
-You are expecting me.
Major Herzoff.
-Yes, sir.
Good evening.
Your room is Number 18. Your bags have been taken up.
-My flowers arrive?
-Yes, sir.
The lady has them.
-Thank you.
Good night.
-Good night, sir.
My darling, you look as charming as ever.
Those same sweet lips, like warm carnations.
Those sweet, mysterious eyes, darker and softer... than the bluest dusk of August violets.
As the poet has it, and I hope he was Aryan.
No one under the bed, I trust.
Uh, bring me a bottle of Krug '28.
-That will be excellent.
-What's happening?
You may have gathered that we were partners in a highly romantic interlude in Prague four years ago.
-By the way, did you like the flowers?
-Does that matter?
-It cost me 12 coupons.
-Well, go on.
Well, tomorrow morning I'm going to phone the admiral... and say that your father is now prepared to work for Germany.
-What?
-I shall say that I persuaded you to reason with him.
They're bound to ask me to take you both along.
The Gestapo man downstairs will let us pass and then —
-Yes, but how do you know he will?
-They listen in to the phone.
They always do.
Then instead of driving to the admiralty, we shall go to a meadow outside Berlin... where a plane is waiting.
I see.
But why should the admiralty believe you've persuaded me?
I shall indicate that, uh, once again you have succumbed to my charms.
Once again?
It happened in Prague, I'm afraid.
And you told them a fantastic story like that?
Well, it was four years ago, there was a harvest moon... and I was younger and more dashing then.
But you really mean all this?
It sounds far too simple.
I have a very simple mind.
But there is one small complication.
Uh...
I shall have to spend the night here — in a purely professional spirit, of course.
-That is necessary?
-Well, sort of fits into the picture.
The place is absolutely crawling with Gestapo.
-Have you any sporting instinct?
-Why? Well, I'll, uh, toss you who sleeps on the couch.
But you're treating all this as if it were some sort of joke.
-You don't seem to realize how much depends upon it.
-It's no good being intense about it.
-You don't think I like the idea of a firing squad, do you?
-What? England may be at war with Germany tomorrow.
Oh, I see. But don't you think I ought to tell my father about all this?
-No.
-Why not?
It'd hardly look right for a lovesick girl to go popping back to her dad.
That'll be the waiter. If you can pretend you find me unbearably attractive, so much the better.
-All right. I'll try.
-Thank you.
My little Anna.
-Is it, uh, raining?
-No, miss.
Is anything the matter?
That tune you were whistling, sir — it is an English tune, isn't it?
-How do you know?
-I heard it on the radio from London last night.
Are you not aware that listening to the foreign broadcasts is forbidden?
-That there is a strict penalty?
-Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I will not report you on this occasion, but see that you are more discreet in future.
Get out.
--(sighs) Very awkward.
Lucky it wasn't ''Rule, Britannia!
'' I handled it rather neatly, I thought.
If a woman ever loved you like you love yourself, it would be one of the romances of history.
As I'm unlikely to think of an adequate reply to that, I think we ought to drink a toast.
England expects that every secret service man this night shall do his duty.
--Flat.
-They're ringing your room.
-I'll take it here. It looks better.
-Hello? Is that call for me?
It's German Admiralty.
Yes. Herzoff here. Yes, sir.
I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour, Herzoff, but we have to alter our plans.
We have just received instructions from headquarters in Munich... that Bomasch is to go there at once by the first train.
But this is ridiculous, sir. Couldn't you delay it for a few hours?
Impossible. It is on the führer's orders. The train leaves in an hour's time.
But, sir, what is the use of sending Herr Bomasch to headquarters in his present frame of mind?
What do you suppose the führer's frame of mind would be if we didn't?
I'm sorry, Herzoff.
-What's happening?
-They're sending you to Munich at once.
-There's only one chance.
-What? -Leave the hotel, scuttle — an old German custom.
-But the guards downstairs.
We got into the admiralty. We'll get out of here.
Get your clothes on. Tell your father we leave here in five minutes.
I've been instructed to leave immediately with Herr Bomasch.
I shall not require you. Dismissed.
-Shall I get you a taxi, sir?
-I'll call one myself.
- - Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
I'm here to escort Herr Bomasch and Fraulein Bomasch to Munich.
The controller phoned me 10 minutes ago.
I was about to drive them to the admiralty myself.
My orders are to take them straight to the station.
The train leaves in 50 minutes.
Evidently a misunderstanding on my part.
-Very well.
We are ready. -You, sir?
Certainly. Were you not told?
I have the admiral's authority to travel with them.
He feels it essential that Herr Bomasch should be persuaded to comply with our wishes... before he reaches headquarters.
I was progressing extremely well with Fraulein Bomasch when this happened.
I see. Very good, sir.
-Zigaretten!
Zigarren!
-There's not a copy of this week's Punch?
-Please?
Punch. English magazine.
Very humorous. You must have a copy.
No.
She hasn't got a Punch, old man.
-Hasn't she?
-No.
Well. Sold out, I suppose.
You will all leave here and find places elsewhere.
This compartment is commandeered by the police. Come along. No delay, please.
They've got La Vie Parisienne, old boy.
La Vie Parisienne? All right.
Don't bother about a Punch.
Oh.
Everyone's hopped it.
Must have got in the wrong train, I expect.
--We can have a side each to ourselves now.
-Put our feet up.
-There.
Bought a copy of Mein Kampf.
Occurred to me it might shed a spot of light on all this how-do-you-do.
-Ever read it?
-Never had the time.
I understand they give a copy to all the bridal couples over here.
Oh, I don't think it's that sort of book, old man.
This is the compart — Why are you still here?
-What?
-You must find other places at once.
We have first-class tickets, you know.
Outside, please. This compartment has been commandeered by the authorities.
-That is beside the point.
-Yes. We are British subjects.
Yes. Look here.
''We, Edward Frederick Lindley, Viscount Halifax...
His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State'' et cetera... ''request all whom it may concern... to allow the bearer to pass without let or hindrance... and to afford him or her'' —
Outside!
-Hmm.
-No good arguing, I suppose.
-Apparently not.
Waste of time, all this bilge in the passport.
Come, please.
-It's hopeless. We'll never get away now.
-We'll think of something.
-Outside. Come along. Hurry!
-All right. All right.
Hel —
Excuse me.
Now, don't forget that you're terribly attracted to me.
The two guards' compartment is in there, sir.
All right. Thank you.
-Would you like to face the engine?
-Whatever you like.
Did you notice that German officer who came into our compartment?
Yes. Why?
Well, I could've sworn it was old Dicky Randall.
Dicky Randall?
--Yes. We were at Balliol together.
You must have heard me talking about him. He used to bowl slow leg breaks.
Played for the Gentlemen once.
Caught and bowled for a duck, I remember.
Oh, yes.
Dicky Randall.
Well, if he's a German officer, how can he be Dicky Randall?
Well, I knew him quite well. His rooms were next to mine.
Why on earth —
You don't think he's working for the Nazis like that fellow what's-his-name?
Traitor?
Hardly, old man.
He played for the Gentlemen.
Only once.
I was looking in a shop window in the Graben... and I saw the reflection of a girl.
For a moment, I thought it was you.
-Were you by yourself?
-Yes. Why?
I just wondered.
It's a blackout.
You know what that means so far west as this.
England and France have declared war.
We have nothing to fear. The nation is behind the führer.
Yes, but how far behind?
We're stopping.
Everybody out at once, please!
Everybody out on the platform.
Everybody out of the compartment, please. Everybody out at once, please.
-Why are we stopping?
-I don't know yet, sir. Just had the order.
Everybody out, please. Everybody out. Everybody out.
-How far are we from Munich?
-About an hour's journey.
All passengers off the train, please.
All passengers off the train.
All passengers off the train, please.
-What's happening?
-Everybody —
Heil Hitler! This train is required for troops.
There will be only a small amount of room available for passengers.
-My party must have the same accommodations.
-Oh, yes. The train leaves again in 20 minutes.
May I have your carriage number, please, sir?
-Yes. It's, uh, 0735.
-0735.
Oh, I beg your pardon. Aren't you old Dicky Randall?
Major Herzoff, Corps of Engineers.
Oh, I'm frightfully sorry.
It was very silly of me, but it's an amazing likeness.
Yes, you'd better come along, old man.
Extraordinary. English, I presume.
-Apparently.
-They're a very peculiar race.
We have a small waiting room, sir. Perhaps you would prefer to wait in there.
-Thank you.
-This way, please.
Please. Please, this way.
Everybody off the train now, please!
Everybody off the train!
You know, you — you made me feel painfully embarrassed, Caldicott.
Well, I can't help it if old Dicky Randall has a double.
You must realize that we're traveling in very difficult times.
--What's the matter?
I can't help thinking of your face when he said, ''Major Herzoff, Corps of Engineers.''
Well, all I can say, Charters, is that when it comes to humor... we live in entirely different worlds.
This waiting room is required.
Every passenger must wait outside. Come on.
Und you too, please. Come on. So quick like possible.
-This is getting beyond a joke.
-Yes. We can't stand for this.
Come on, please. Out.
Everybody out so quick as possible. Everybody must wait outside.
All passengers must wait outside. Please go.
No good being undignified, old man.
No, quite right.
Come on. Please, please, please, please. Come on.
Come on. Come on. So.
Oh, Major. May I phone Munich to notify them of our delay?
Of course.
My absence may provide the opportunity for Fraulein Bomasch to approach her father.
It might help.
You seem to have made a considerable impression on the lady, Major.
I apologize for doubting your capabilities.
Stay on guard here. See that no one enters or leaves.
Understand? No one.
-That man who spoke to you, did you know him? -Yes, I did.
A fellow called Caldicott.
It's probably the first time he's ever left England before the end of the cricket season.
-Just my luck. He gave me a very nasty moment.
-No one would have guessed it.
I was a member of the Foreign Office operatic society.
Do you know I once played Pooh-Bah to the Foreign Secretary's Ko-Ko?
-Have you thought of any way of getting us out of this?
A car will be waiting at Munich to take us to headquarters.
We'll be quite a crowd, and I shall ask for a second car so that we can be alone.
-Suppose they don't give it to us.
-They will. Because by that time, we shall be on the verge of persuading your father to work for Germany.
You, on the other hand, must be asking for time to think.
-You get the idea?
-Yes, but — Then we only have the chauffeur to deal with. And after that — Switzerland.
-Switzerland?
-Well, we can hardly break through the Siegfried line.
Yes, but Switzerland's a long way from Munich.
If we can bluff them into giving us that car, we'll make it.
So from now on, Mr. Bomasch, you've got to make up your mind... whether to keep your armor plating or let it go rusty.
-Is that quite clear?
-I think so.
And you're still so crazy about me that you would sell the armor plating for a very small lock of my hair.
All right.
You can't sit here!
-Why not?
-This truck is required.
Come on. Off, off, off, off, off, off.
I suppose these bags aren't required too?
Off, off, off, off, off, off, off.
Pushed about from pillar to post by this railway ever since we got on the train.
-Everything we sit on seems to be required.
-It's monstrous.
-We shall write to the company about this.
-Hmm! You're not at war with England yet, you know.
But you are mistaken.
France declared war this afternoon.
Und England declared war this morning.
So! Achtung!
War.
Yes.
-Good heavens.
-What's the matter?
My golf clubs.
Where are they?
I lent them to Max in Berlin.
Like a fool, I said he needn't bring them back till next Wednesday.
Probably seen the last of them.
Yes. I expect they'll require them for something or other.
I read in the paper that they're pulling up park railings.
I don't see the connection, old man.
Well, your clubs are steel, aren't they?
-Yes.
-So.
There you are then.
Whip shafts too.
Especially made for me.
Why not get in touch with Max?
-How?
-On the telephone.
Ask him to send them to London immediately.
It's a desperate chance, but it's worth taking.
I shall never be able to replace them.
-Oh, uh, telephone?
-Hmm?
Stationmaster's office.
Captain Strasse?
Marsen here.
-I'm speaking from Kurtbaden.
-Oh, I beg your pardon.
It concerns Major Herzoff, sir.
I think a full inquiry should be made at once... in view of something which happened a few minutes ago.
A few minutes ago?
You mean he's with you?
Admiral Hassinger gave him the authority.
Hassinger did?
He never told me.
That's very suspicious.
Yes, but the admiral himself introduced him.
I'll ask him. I'll phone you back.
Uh, what is your number there?
Yes, yes, yes. In a few minutes.
Admiral Hassinger, please.
Hello? I want a long-distance call to Berlin.
Oliver 2-4-double 6.
What?
Yes. Yes, of course it's important.
-It's all in German.
-Hmm.
What?
Well, how long then?
Oh, all right.
Blasted junction's engaged by the military. They'll call me back.
These people seem to have no idea of business as usual.
If I were asked to give a snap judgment, I should say that was an ''S.''
-More like an ''F.''
-I do not know, sir.
I used to know someone who made his S's like that.
-Someone in the War Office?
-Well, no.
Ach. We can't afford to waste time.
You didn't give him permission to travel with the prisoners, did you, sir?
No, no. But he may have assumed it.
If you remember, we more or less gave him carte Blanche.
The only thing is to check up with the War Office, sir.
-I suppose so.
-War Office.
If he's right, this will be very serious for you, Kampfeldt.
Very serious indeed.
The letter was addressed to you. There's no denying that, Kampfeldt.
Quite right. I'm afraid I shall have to sack my secretary.
Hello?
--That'll be our call.
Aufschliessen!
Hmm!
What infernal impudence.
I'll bet it's my call.
Marsen speaking. Yes, sir.
Listen, Marsen. You were right. We have been completely fooled.
Herzoff is not known at the War Office.
There is no officer of that name on the army list.
Then, uh —
Yes, sir. Obviously. An enemy agent.
I say, Charters, there's another phone in there.
What?
Oh. Lucky.
--Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
-Gone dead.
-Hello!
-Why not try the thingamy?
Yeah. -You know, the... gadget.
-Oh.
Hello —
It's the extension. That chap out there.
Well, perhaps he'll be off the line in a minute.
-Shh!
-What's up?
They're talking about what's-his-name.
You know, Herzoff.
No. He doesn't suspect.
Yes, sir. I see.
All passengers aboard, please!
No time to stand here now, sir. The train is leaving.
What?
Listen, we can't afford to take risks.
Carry on with Herzoff to Munich.
Let him think he's getting away with it. Understand?
I'll get on to army headquarters there.
Very good, sir.
All passengers aboard, please!
-Everybody on the train!
-What is it?
Well, as far as I can make out, Herzoff isn't Herzoff.
-What?
-No.
They're sending an escort to arrest him — when we get to Munich.
-Herzoff?
-Yes.
Well — Then —
-Listen, if — if Herzoff isn't Herzoff —
-What? -Well, he must be Dicky Randall.
-Yes.
Everybody on the train!
All passengers aboard, please!
All passengers on the last two coaches only!
All passengers aboard!
-All passengers aboard.
-After you, Major.
All passengers on the last two coaches only.
All passengers on the last two coaches.
All passengers aboard.
All passengers on the last two coaches only.
All passengers on the last two coaches.
All passengers aboard.
Keep within call. I shall need you at Munich, perhaps before.
-One thing emerges very clearly from all this.
-Caldicott!
-The train! There it goes!
Oh, my, my! That's a mess!
-That was a near thing.
I thought we were going to be in this infernal country for the duration.
Oh, my Lord.
Don't anticipate, old man.
What were you saying just now about something emerging very clearly?
-I said?
-Mmm.
-When?
-On the platform.
-About something emerging?
-Mmm. What was it?
-What was what?
-What emerged.
-You never said.
-Oh.
We do not wish to persuade you to become a National Socialist, Herr Bomasch.
I explained that to your daughter.
Have I not? And you may work wherever you choose, Father.
-Isn't that so?
-Quite. -After all, we should have our freedom.
-I know, my dear.
But freedom is strangely interpreted in this country.
I do not agree with you, Herr Bomasch.
Freedom in Germany is a great advance on freedom elsewhere.
It's properly organized and controlled by the state.
I'd much rather we kept politics out of it.
Herr Bomasch unfortunately refuses to understand... the sacred importance of the Nazi world mission.
-His stay in England perhaps.
-No doubt. A corrupt influence.
A corrupt country.
Controlled by international Freemasons and the Jew Churchill.
But since you wish it, Herr Bomasch, we will drop politics... and discuss it from a more personal basis.
I'm certain, Charters, that what you were about to say... was that we've stumbled on something pretty serious.
There's no doubt which side Randall's playing for.
-Ours?
-Yes.
Yes. That's what was emerging so clearly.
It's up to us to find some way of warning him.
Yes. Come on. Let's find him.
-I say, Caldicott.
-Yes? -Do you think we're wise rushing into this?
-How do you mean?
Well, I mean we've no proof that Randall's working for England.
-Well, everything points to it.
-Yes, but is that enough?
We're enemy aliens... and these Nazis are pretty free with their firing party.
Hmm. Well, ought we to let that stand in our way?
Well, certainly not.
I mean if — if we were certain.
As it is, we've just got to bear it in mind.
I don't see what else he can be doing.
For all we know, he may be an international crook.
Crooks don't generally play for the Gentlemen.
Raffles did.
That's fiction.
Still, you may be right, Charters.
Of course, if we were certain, we'd do our duty and take the risk.
Yes, of course.
As it is, I can get on with Mein Kampf.
Haven't got out of Hitler's boyhood yet.
And, Herr Bomasch, what is even more important... your daughter will be able to live with you or wherever she pleases.
-You must give me time to think.
-Certainly.
We should be in Munich in... 40 minutes.
Indeed. For the first time, I will be sorry when the journey's over.
Yes. I — I can believe that.
I think we should order something to eat.
An excellent idea.
Just in case we do not find headquarters in a very... hospitable frame of mind.
-Please.
-Oh, sorry.
You don't choose to stand up when a German officer passes?
You see, we're English.
Your passports.
Oh, beg your pardon. You're quite right.
The English should not stand up.
They should go down on their fat bellies and crawl.
-Now look here!
We shall generously permit you to run back to England... no doubt to find yourselves safe jobs.
Meanwhile, you may sit down.
-''Fat bellies.'' -''Safe jobs.''
As if they weren't all taken by now anyway.
Caldicott, this is absolutely and finally the last straw.
-Yes, Charters.
-We'll warn Dicky Randall at once, come what may.
I'm with you, old man.
It's things like that that bring it home to you.
Sandwiches, biscuits. Yes, sir.
Will you take tea substitute or coffee substitute?
Tea for me, please.
-Tea.
-Fine.
He's in there. That Gestapo fellow's there too.
Yes.
A couple of storm troopers in there.
How the devil are we going to pass him the word without that fellow spotting it?
-We've got to do it somehow.
-Yes. Of course, he — he might come out for a minute. I mean, most people do.
We must act, Charters. It's no good hanging about on the off chance.
Excuse, please.
-Wait a minute. That steward.
-What about him?
Well, he's bound to come back sometime to bring their order.
By Jove, yes.
Here he comes.
-? (whistling) -Excuse, please.
-Oh, what — what time do we get to Munich?
-In about 30 minutes, sir.
Thank you.
-All right?
-Yes. I put it underneath a doughnut.
Good.
What?
But how do you know they're for him?
Well, I suddenly remembered that Dicky Randall always had doughnuts... sent up to his room for afternoon tea.
That's very clever of you, old man.
-Better get along there, hey?
-Mmm, right.
-Oh, my Lord.
-Why, what's up?
Why, I'm — I'm wondering if it was doughnuts.
-What?
-I — I believe it was rock cakes.
Have you made all arrangements for transport at Munich, Marsen?
Every arrangement, sir.
-Will there be more than one car?
-Almost certainly two.
Then let's see, that will make seven. Rather a crowd.
I think in order to finish my talk with Herr Bomasch, you had better take the second car.
Very good, sir.
I believe Herr Bomasch is really beginning to see that I am doing my best to help him.
I'm sure he knows that.
Yes, yes, Major. Your attitude has been most reasonable.
You must remember it's only a few hours since Father was taken out of England by force.
Captain Marsen was only obeying orders.
Members of the Gestapo are frequently asked to perform duties... which others find too objectionable.
Some are objectionable.
Others I find extremely satisfying.
I often envy you your opportunities.
What is that, the bill?
I will pay.
No, please. I am escorting the party.
My dear Marsen, it's my privilege.
In fact, it is an order.
Terrible. The way prices have gone up already.
Excuse me.
-Yes, I-I'm Randall.
-How are you, old man?
-You remember me?
-Yes. -This is Charters, an old friend of mine.
-How do you do? Well, what is it?
-We don't know what you're up to, of course.
-Never mind about that.
But whatever it is, you appear to be on the spot. Tell him about it, Charters.
Well, I was phoning Berlin about my golf clubs.
By the way, I'm resigned to the fact I shall never see them again, Caldicott.
-Yes, well, get on with it.
-I was just coming to that.
I was telephoning and got on the other chap's line — you know, that Gestapo fellow.
I overheard him saying they were sending a military escort... to arrest you when you get to Munich.
You see, you're rumbled. They know that you're not Herzoff.
Now listen. I can't tell you everything. There isn't time.
But I've got to get that old man and the girl out of this country at all costs.
Oh, a — an official job.
Are you two fellows game to help me?
What, against Germany?
I'll say we are after all they've done to us. What do you say, Caldicott?
-Absolutely, old man. Backs to the wall.
-I hope not.
I say, could you give me a little more room to think?
-Is there any tea left?
-Yes, I think so, Ulrich.
There's no time for tea. We reach Munich in a few minutes.
Oh, time for just one cup. Cake, darling?
No, thank you.
I am afraid I must ask you to drop this little comedy.
It is very entertaining, but I have certain formalities to attend to.
Comedy?
What do you mean?
Oh, thank you.
You're merely pretending to be infatuated with this man.
There's no such person as Major Herzoff.
He's a British agent trying to get you and your father out of Germany.
You must be crazy.
Ulrich.
I don't propose to waste the time of the Gestapo denying it.
Thank you.
You — You're going to give yourself up?
Well, they have lots of proof, Mr. Bomasch.
An escort will be waiting at Munich to take you in charge.
You can't do this.
-He's an enemy agent.
-Weren't you?
Didn't you do exactly the same as he's doing?
With a slight but important difference. I wasn't caught.
-Are you just going to sit there and do nothing?
-Now, please don't make a scene.
-Don't you realize what this means?
-Yes, I do. But he has a gun, and I haven't. And he's got a couple of reserves next door.
Who do you take me for — Bulldog Drummond?
Can't you be serious even now?
I told you this would happen.
I told you your scheme was absolutely childish, but you wouldn't listen to me.
Why didn't you stay in England instead of coming over here... and deliberately throwing your life away, you fool?
I have no time to listen to this ridiculous display.
Steiner!
Dreimund!
If there is more than one major on the train... how are we to know which one to arrest?
Our man's got a Gestapo officer watching him.
Hmm. Who has not these days?
--The train.
-Heil Hitler.
-Heil Hitler!
Marsen. I'm on instruction from Fifth Army Headquarters to arrest Major Herzoff.
I fear you will need a stretcher.
The prisoner tried to escape, and I had to, uh — to deal with him.
You will find him in the last compartment, Coach 66.
Uh, what — what transport have you?
-Two cars.
-Excellent.
Now, this is Herr Axel Bomasch from Harska and his daughter.
They are in protective custody, and I have instructions... to take them to General Von Komwitz without delay.
With your permission, I will use one of the cars.
-Certainly.
-I'll leave you to take charge of the prisoner.
Will you show me my car?
-Brunner.
Take this S.S. officer to the car.
-Coach 66 you said?
-The last compartment.
Full length on the seat.
Sergeant, get a stretcher from the stationmaster and follow me.
Olson, you will take the S.S. officer and his party in your car.
One moment. Is your chauffeur to be trusted?
I think so. He is a very old member of the party.
Anti-Russian perhaps. I think I'd rather take one of my own men.
-I'm traveling to a place of the greatest secrecy.
-Very good. -You will not be needed, Olson.
-Very good, sir.
Rumplemeyer, you will drive.
-Heil Hitler.
-Heil Hitler.
-Heil Hitler.
-Heil Hitler.
Come on, quick.
Right, man! Right! You're not in England.
-Oh, I'd forgotten.
Not much of a life, a secret agent.
And the pay is bad too, sir.
I was just thinking, Charters.
In the last war, the army took over Lord's Cricket Ground for drilling troops on.
-Wonder if they'll do it this time.
-Shortsighted, you know.
Better pull up here, Charters. We can't get to Switzerland by any of the main roads.
Let me take over, will you?
Age around 22, height 5'4''.
Slim figure, dark, brown eyes.
That's the lot. Phone these descriptions to all stations within a hundred-mile radius.
A report has just come in, sir, that the car has left the city by the south road.
So they are making for Switzerland.
-We take the road.
-Very good.
There's one thing that's worrying me, Randall, old man.
It may be silly of me, of course, but —
How exactly are we going to get across the Swiss frontier?
I know a little place where I used to go climbing — about 8,000 feet up where Switzerland and Germany meet.
You're not going to ask us to hang about on ropes, I hope.
I'm not, but they may. There's a narrow road leads right to the top.
-What's over the top?
-Switzerland.
-Anything in between?
-6,000-feet drop.
-Well, how can we, uh —
-Skip it.
Skip it?
-There's a car following us!
-Is there?
Well, here we go.
Don't let them get away!
I'll have to change the wheel!
Watch the road, Charters.
Hello! Anybody here?
Caldicott.
Anybody around?
-Switzerland.
Good morning to you, sir.
Good morning.
-Are you in charge here?
-Yes. There's only me.
-I want to cross to Switzerland.
-Now, sir? -Yes, now.
-But we're at war.
I had orders yesterday to close the teleferic.
My orders come from a higher source.
Higher than the chief of police at Maxberg?
-Gestapo headquarters at Munich.
-Oh. I have been instructed to show this lady and gentleman safely out of Germany.
I better ring Christopher.
Yes. Right away.
-There's a car coming. Looks like them.
-There are five of them altogether.
-Keep an eye on them.
-How are the goats, Christopher?
Yes, thank you, Christopher. I got it.
And the butter.
Do you want to be dismissed for incompetence?
They'll be leaving in about two minutes, Christopher.
I shall require to see your papers, sir. Have you got your passports?
How long does this take to cross the valley?
-About four minutes.
-Once it's in midair, can it be stopped?
Why, yes, sir, if anyone wanted to stop it.
Will you follow me to the office?
This way, please.
-Can you see them?
-No, but I can hear the engine.
-How does this thing work?
-That shouldn't be difficult.
-Well, how?
-Yes, obviously, this starts it.
-Yes?
-Yes. This is the speed regulator.
-Speed regulator, right.
Get in quick. -All of you! Quick!
Caldicott! -What about you?
-I'll start it and then jump on.
They're here!
-Come on.
Jump in. -Yes, but they-they'll stop us halfway across.
Get in, will you!
Come on! Quickly!
There it is!
Stand aside!
Olson, go around back!
The téléférique!
They're potting at us!
Duck down!
Get down there and draw his fire.
I'll get in over the roof.
Right.
Come here and stop the machinery! Come back!
Tracy!
Tracy!
Tracy!
Tracy!
- Tracy!
- How do you spell "omelet"?
- Oh, you. - Ninety-four for the ceremony and 506 for the reception.
I don't know where we'll put them all if it should rain.
Oh, it won't rain. Tracy won't stand for it.
- Mother, how do you spell "omelet"?
- O-M-M-E-L-E-T. - I thought there was another L.
- Funny wedding present, an omelet.
It was a dish, dear, a silver dish.
Bring some of that junk off the table.
Mother, be an angel and get these out of the way.
- Yes, darling.
This stinks.
Don't say "stinks," darling. If necessary, "smells."
- But only if necessary.
- These cards have been changed again.
There must be a ghost in the house. Maybe the ghost of groom number one.
Don't talk about Dexter as though he were dead.
- Might as well be for all Tracy cares.
- Right.
- Oh, I wouldn't say that. - If I never see Dexter Haven again, I'll...
- Isn't that awful?
- Friends of your father's.
Wouldn't you know it?
What are they, tap dancers or musical-comedy producers?
- Hardly fair to your father's interest in art.
- Art, my eye. The art of putting up $ 100,000 to display the shapely legs...
- That will do, Tracy.
If you'd just face the facts squarely, as I did...
We might face the fact that neither of us has proved to be a success as a wife.
We just picked the wrong first husbands, that's all.
Don't argue about it. You wanted me to take a stand.
I've taken it. It's the only stand a woman could take and keep her self-respect.
Yes, dear, I know.
Now I have my self-respect and no husband.
You almost talk as though you wanted him back.
He wouldn't come back, probably.
Hey, it's better this way. Really.
You'll see. Let's forget about the past. We both deserve happiness now, especially you.
- Darling.
- Isn't George an angel? - George is an angel.
- Is he handsome or not?
- George is handsome.
- I like Dexter. Really?
Why don't you postpone the wedding?
- How?
- Get smallpox. - Don't put the idea in her head.
- George isn't usually late.
- He's waiting at the stables.
- Waiting... - If I don't choke her before Saturday...
- It'd postpone it.
It would not. Be in the car when I get down.
She's so mean about Dexter.
- He was rather mean to her.
- Did he really sock her? - Please, Dinah.
- Did he, really?
- Darling, you go wait in the car.
- Well, the papers were full of "innundo."
- Of what?
- Of innundo.
Cruelty and drunkenness, it said.
Mother, why won't Tracy ask her own father to the wedding?
Your sister has definite opinions about things.
She's sort of...
Well, you know hard, isn't she?
- Certainly not.
Tracy sets exceptionally high standards for herself, that's all and other people aren't always quite apt to live up to them.
But don't you think it's stinking not at least to want Father?
Yes, darling. Between ourselves, I think it's good and stinking.
Oh, I wish something would happen.
Nothing ever possibly in the least ever happens here.
Mother.
How do you get smallpox?
Oh, Dinah, please go.
This is Uncle Willie's favorite. Complete Surrender.
Where'd you get this idiotic thing, anyway?
Hey!
Never play with fire, particularly on the eve of your wedding.
You're a wicked old man, Uncle Willie.
- Who takes this, anyway, your cook?
- I love it. - It's got pictures of everything.
- It certainly has.
Who is that terribly attractive man?
Can Tracy pick them, or can she?
- If you're asking me...
- I'm not. - Hello, darling.
- Hello.
- Well, how do you like me?
- I adore you, but you look awful.
- Awful? - Like something out of a shop window.
Well, Tracy, I...
What...?
Hey, what...?
- Say, cut it out!
They're new.
- That's just it. But they're not going to be.
There, that's better. I don't get it.
When I was a coal miner, the idea was to buy clean clothes.
Now that I'm general manager...
Say, Dinah anything in there about the wedding?
- What do you mean?
- I thought maybe you being one of the oldest families in Philadelphia and me getting fairly important myself...
It's luck, of course, but... - What's the matter?
- "Average Day in the Life of a Congressman.
The wife. The kitchen, where is prepared one banana, sliced, two fried eggs.
Congressman kisses wife good morning."
- People like publicity.
- Of all the filthy ideas.
Coming into a private house with a camera.
George Kittredge, you get on that horse.
- What do you think?
- What if I took it into my head to go into politics?
- You'd be elected president.
- I don't know about that.
I mean publicity.
- Not in my home. You mean our home, don't you?
Sorry, darling. I mean very much our home.
Oh, never mind, Eddie. I'll get up myself.
Now, steady, Bessie.
Whoa, Bessie.
Whoa. That's it...
Whoa, Bessie.
Whoa! Here, here, here.
Whoa.
Now, steady, Bessie.
Grab the reins, George, with the left hand.
- Put salt on his tail.
Steady, Bessie.
There.
Whoa, whoa, Bessie. Whoa.
What's the matter?
You act worried. Maybe it's because his name is Jack.
Heigh-ho, Silver.
- Hello, Joe.
- Hi, Mike. I'm not gonna do it, Liz. I'm gonna tell Sidney Kidd I'm a writer.
I'm not a society snoop. Gonna tell him just that.
Just that.
Let Kidd fire me!
I'll write short stories again. That's what I should be doing.
- I'm gonna tell him just that.
Come in.
- I don't think you're being fair to me.
- No? No. You're treating me like you treat all your other writers.
You really hate me, don't you, Connor?
No. I don't like you very much, though.
You hate me, I trust, Miss Imbrie?
No. I can't afford to hate anybody. I'm only a photographer.
Ask him to wait.
Your assignment will be Spy's most sensational achievement:
Tracy Lord.
Big-game hunting in Africa, fox hunting in Pennsylvania.
Married on impulse and divorced in a rage, and always unapproachable by the press.
The unapproachable Miss Lord...
"The Philadelphia Story."
"Close to the Portals of Snobbish Fox Hunting." No.
"No Hunter of Foxes is Spy Magazine."
Anyway, present it for the first time, quote:
"A Wedding Day Inside Mainline Society."
"Or What the Kitchen Maid Saw Through the Keyhole." Unquote.
- Writing's your job. I'm only the publisher.
- All right, publisher, take this:
Quote, "No Hunter of Buckshot in the Rear is Cagey, Crafty Connor." Unquote.
Close paragraph.
Close job, close bank account.
How can we get inside the Lord estate, let alone the house?
Now, we're not gonna do it, Liz. Doggone it, it's degrading.
It's undignified. So is an empty stomach. How do we get in?
Ask the gentleman to come in.
- I understand we understand each other.
- Quite. This gentleman has been employed in our Buenos Aires office.
He came yesterday on the clipper. I believe he can help with our problem.
- How?
- Tracy Lord's brother, Junius is in the American Embassy there.
And he's an old friend of this gentleman's.
He'll introduce you to the Lords as intimate friends of Junius.
Dear old Junius.
This Tracy Lord...
She know you?
You might say Miss Lord and I grew up together.
You might also say you were her first husband.
- Yes, you might.
- Holy mackerel. What goes on here?
I remember your honeymoon very well. You and she on a little sailboat.
- The True Love, wasn't it?
- That's right.
How did you know? I was the only photographer whose camera you didn't smash.
You were terribly nice about it. You threw it in the ocean.
Oh, one of those, huh?
Yes, I had a strange idea our honeymoon was our business.
He paid for all the cameras.
- I got a nice little letter of apology too.
- Always the gentleman, huh?
Except on occasion.
Now, what are the plans?
The wedding's Saturday. Today is Thursday.
They should spend tomorrow as guests of the Lords.
Listen, there's something screwy here.
If you resigned, why are you doing this unless you...
Oh, you wanna get even with your ex-bride, huh?
I'll have a car pick them up at noon tomorrow in North Philadelphia.
Here, Mike, there's a little spit in your eye.
Maybe they'd rather we go to the servants' entrance.
Maybe this is the servants' entrance.
Good morning, Edward.
Why, Mr. Haven, sir.
Is Mrs. Haven...
I mean, Miss Tracy or her mother in?
They may be down at the swimming pool. Shall I announce you?
No. No, I'll go around myself and surprise them.
- It will be a surprise.
- These are friends of Mr. Junius.
- Have them wait in the south parlor.
- Certainly, Mr. Haven.
Excuse me, sir.
The south parlor?
Miss Imbrie, the south parlor.
The queen will have bread and honey at the usual time.
Seems a little cold for the south parlor.
I rather expected to find pickaninnies and banjos.
What's this room?
I forgot my compass.
Well, this would be south-southwest parlor by living room.
Knickknacks, gimcracks, signed photographs.
You have to be rich as the Lords to live in a dump like this.
- I wouldn't live in it if they paid me.
Looks like they're running a hock shop on the side.
Well, I...
Just looking around.
I'll want your fingerprints for this.
What's this guy Haven up to?
- C.K. Dexter Haven.
- What kind of a name is that, anyway?
C.K. Dexter Haven.
Well, Macaulay Connor is no homespun tag, my pet.
Well, you just try calling me Macaulay.
I knew a plain Joe Smith once.
He was only a clerk in a hardware store, but he was an absolute rat.
C.K. Dexter Haven. He plays polo. He designs sailboats.
- Class boats, very upper-class.
- Oh, don't despair.
He's out, and Kittredge, man of the people, is in.
Quite a comer too, I understand.
Political timber. Poor guy. Wonder how he fell for it?
Liz, what did I tell you?
Look, how do you like this:
"Living room, sitting room, terrace, pool, stables."
So they can talk to the horses without having them in the house.
Don't, Mike.
- Yes?
- This is the bridal suite.
Send up a couple of caviar sandwiches and some beer.
What? Who is this?
This is the voice of doom calling.
Your days are numbered to the seventh son of the seventh son.
- Hello?
Hello? - What's the matter?
One of the servants has been at the sherry again.
Dexter!
Dexter, you've come back!
Dinah, my dream girl.
What in the name of...?
Oh, no, it can't be. He went to South America for two years.
Edward said they were at the swimming pool.
They seem to be here.
Dexter, don't you know that tomorrow is the wedding?
Oh, that's right.
You can go right back where you came from.
Can't. Dinah says it's awful here without me.
Hello, you sweet thing.
Red, you look in the pink.
You don't think I'd miss your wedding, do you?
- Dexter, you wouldn't.
- I'm not so sure he wouldn't.
No, Mother Lord, I assure you I wouldn't.
- Tell us about Junius.
- Stay to lunch.
Sure. Don't bother to open your house. Stay here.
We're having no houseguests. No?
How about the groom?
- He's staying at the gatehouse.
- Oh, that's good. - Junius is fine.
- He should be here.
He's heartbroken. I suggested representing him as best man.
George might prefer to have his best man sober.
- I wish you'd represent George.
- That's my loyal little girl.
- You'll like the people Junius did send.
- You haven't switched to dope, have you?
The people Junius did send, did you say?
You don't know Macaulay Connor or Elizabeth Imbrie, do you?
- We can finish later.
- I better introduce you.
Call me for...
Introduce me to whom?
Imbrie and Connor. Tell them which rooms they're to have.
He wants to know whether to wear a black or white tie to the party.
Rooms?
I'd better start from the beginning.
Sit down. They're friends of Junius.
And they expect to stay here?
I think that's queer, indeed.
- It's queerer than that.
It's paranoiac. - Well, it was Junius' idea.
- They've been kind to him and there's...
- You're lying, Dexter. I can always tell.
- Can you, Red?
- But if they're Junius' friends...
You went to work after the divorce.
Except for an interlude in alcoholic sanitariums.
- You took a job in South America.
For?
- A magazine. - And it wasn't by chance Spy magazine?
- You are a mass of intuition.
And Junius' friends are photographers?
I never thought you'd sink to do...
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to phone Junius.
Wait, Red, wait. You don't have to telephone Junius.
No, you're slipping, Red.
I used to be afraid of that look.
The withering glance of the goddess.
I didn't think that alcohol would...
- Dinah, stay here.
- Oh, please, Mother.
- Maybe he's going to sock her again.
- Don't say sock. Strike is quite an ugly enough word.
Who do they think they are, barging in on people?
- They'll think you don't want them.
- I want them out and you too.
Yes, your majesty, but first, could I interest you in some blackmail?
- No. - Well, it's an article...
It's ready for publication in Spy.
And it's about your father and that dancer.
- About Father and Tina Morrow?
- Now, quiet.
But they can't.
Well, they can't...
Even if it's true.
Where do you get these?
- Kidd, the editor.
- He's got to be stopped.
Well, he is, temporarily.
If you'll allow those two to turn in a story on your wedding.
And when Kidd says a story, he means a story.
- I'm going to be sick.
- Yes, an intimate day with a society bride.
I am sick.
Tough, but that's the way it seems to be.
I'm to be examined, undressed, humiliated.
At 15 cents a copy.
And you, you...
- You're loving it.
- Well, we're hooked.
- Are they reporters?
- Not friends of Junius?
- They aren't anybody's friends.
- We're to pretend they are.
- Why? Don't ask me. There's a good reason, and it's my wedding, so please.
- I'll bet it's Father and that dancer.
- Dinah, what do you know?
- Oh, I listen around.
- Is there no privacy anymore?
Only in bed, Mother, and not always there.
Watching every little mannerism, jotting notes on how we talk and move.
- Will they do that?
- And all in that snide, corkscrew English.
If we have to submit to save Father's face which, incidentally, doesn't deserve it I'm giving them a picture of life that'll stand their hair on end.
No! Tracy, we must just be ourselves, very much ourselves.
But you want us to create a good impression.
They don't know that we know, I hope.
No, that was understood. The girl's nice. He writes stories.
- Very down-to-earth.
- They'll love us. Oh, dear, you both better dress.
Please, promise to behave like ladies in front of these creatures.
We'll do our best, Mrs. Lord. I don't know how good that is.
Dexter, how perfectly dreadful.
And what will they say about Seth not being here for his daughter's wedding?
I know, darling.
Come on.
You better go and tell them how terribly happy we are to have them.
That's the old Quaker spirit, Mother Lord. Now, keep swinging.
Thought it was that butler.
The family will welcome you in a moment.
- What with?
- With open arms.
They're happy to have friends of Junius.
- They don't know about us?
- Why should they?
Look, Haven our research department didn't give us much data.
This fiancé of this girl, George Kittredge, age 32.
- You know him well?
- Well enough. General manager, Quaker State Coal. Controlling interest owned by Seth Lord.
That's the girl's father, huh?
- What a coincidence. - How'd he meet her?
Heaven brought them together, I imagine.
Seth Lord. See bankers' annual directory of directors.
- So is there a library in town?
- Yes. I suppose you wouldn't know where.
Well, roughly. My grandfather built it.
Now, about this girl Tracy Samantha Lord.
What about her?
Well, what's her leading characteristic?
She has a horror of men who wear their hats in the house.
Leading characteristics to be filled in later.
I can fill them in right now.
The young, rich, rapacious American female.
No other country where she exists.
And would I change places with Tracy Samantha Lord for all her wealth and beauty?
Oh, boy, just ask me.
Well, tell four footmen to call me in time for lunch, will you?
How do you do?
- Friends of my brother, are you not?
- We... I am Dinah Lord. My real name is Diana, but my sister changed it.
I'm Elizabeth Imbrie.
I spoke French before I spoke English.
My childhood was in Paris, where my father worked in a bank.
- The House of Morgan.
Can you play the piano?
I can, and sing at the same time.
What is this?
Idiot, probably.
Smallpox?
How do you do?
I'm Tracy Lord. It's so nice having you here.
- How did you leave Junius?
- We left Junius fine.
- That little sister of yours...
- Isn't she a dear?
So talented. - Junius is such a lamb, isn't he?
- Yes, isn't he?
It's a pity none of the males of the family are going to be here to welcome you.
- Where's your father?
- Darling Papa.
- I do hope you'll stay for my wedding.
- We'd like to. - That was our idea.
- I'm so glad it occurred to you.
The house is rather a mess, of course.
We'll all have to huddle here and overflow onto the porch.
- I hope your rooms are comfortable.
- Your father sick?
What a cunning little camera.
- I'm afraid I'm a nuisance with it.
- You couldn't be. I hope you'll take loads.
Dear Papa and Mama aren't allowing reporters in.
That is, except for little Mr. Grace, who does the social news.
Can you imagine a grown-up man having to sink so low?
It does seem kind of bad.
You're a kind of writer, aren't you, Mr. Connor?
Sort of.
- A book?
- Yes. Under what name do you publish?
My own. Macaulay Connor.
What's the Macaulay for?
Well, my father taught English history.
I'm Mike to my friends.
Of whom you have many, I'm sure.
English history, it's always fascinated me. Cromwell, Robin Hood, Jack the Ripper.
Where did he teach?
- I mean your father.
- A high school in South Bend, Indiana.
South Bend. It sounds like dancing, doesn't it?
You must have had a most happy childhood there.
- It was terrific.
- I'm so glad. - I didn't mean it that way.
- I'm so sorry.
Well, lack of wherewithal, I guess.
That doesn't always cause unhappiness, does it?
Not if you're the right kind of man.
George Kittredge, my fiancé, never had anything, and he...
Are either of you married?
- No.
- No.
- You were, but you're divorced?
- The fact is... Surely you're not ashamed of it.
- Of course I'm not ashamed of it.
- What? Well, it was years ago. I was only a kid in Duluth.
- Good heavens, Liz, you never told me...
- You never asked me.
Well, I know, but you...
Joe Smith. Hardware.
Well, you're the darnedest girl, Liz.
I think I'm sweet.
Duluth. That must be a lovely spot. It's west of here, isn't it?
Sort of, but occasionally we get the breezes.
And this is your first visit in Philadelphia.
It's a quaint place, don't you think?
Filled with relics. How old are you?
Thirty.
One book isn't much for a man of 30.
I don't mean to criticize. You probably have interests outside work.
None.
I mean, unless...
How sweet.
Are you going together?
- I beg your pardon?
- That is an odd question, I must say.
Well, I don't see why. I think it's very interesting.
Miss Imbrie don't you agree if a man says he loves a girl, he ought to marry?
- Can she be human?
- Please, I asked Miss Imbrie a question.
- Well, that depends.
L... - I'll see what's keeping Mama.
Look, who's doing the interviewing here?
- You don't suppose she caught on?
- No. She was born that way.
- Don't let her throw you.
- Want to take over?
- I wanna go home.
- Here you are.
How do you do?
We're happy to have you.
Forgive me for not coming in sooner. Things are in such a state.
My little girl.
She's going to leave me.
Aren't you pretty, my dear? But then Junius' friends always are.
Look at the way she wears her hair, Tracy.
Isn't it pretty?
Mighty fine.
Shall we have sherry on the porch?
Thank you.
- This is my youngest daughter, Diana.
- I think we've met.
I wish my husband were here. We expect him presently.
He's been detained on business for that lovely dancer Tina Morrow.
- Do you know her work?
- Not professionally.
So talented and such a lovely person, but like many artists, no business head.
- None whatever.
- I have some lovely presents.
Don't you think so, Mr. Connor?
Hello, everybody.
- I hope I'm not late.
- You're never late, George.
We have a lovely surprise.
Junius has sent us these dear people as a wedding present.
Mr. Kittredge, this is Miss...?
I'm so sorry.
- Imbrie.
- Any friend of Junius is a friend of mine.
- And Mr...?
- I didn't get the name.
- Connor.
- Macaulay Connor.
- He's a writer.
- Don't apologize...
No apology necessary. I have respect for writers.
- Well, thank you.
Any kind word is... - How are you, dear?
Much better now that you're here.
- I guess this must be love.
- Your guess is correct.
I'm just his faithful old dog, Tray.
- Give me your paw.
How sweet.
- Say, I'd like to see one of those.
- You will. Shall we have some sherry?
I suppose Junius has told you all about our family.
Papa!
What?
Dear Papa!
You angel, to get here in time for lunch.
- Isn't he, Mama?
- Indeed he is, but...
Father, this is Miss Imbrie and Mr. Connor.
How are you, Mr. Lord?
- Fine, thank you.
How are you? - How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Hiya, Pops.
Oh, dear Dinah.
Father, here's George.
Hello, Kittredge. Margaret, my sweet.
- Another place for luncheon, Edward.
- Very good, madam.
Well here I am.
In the bosom of my...
- Hello, friends and enemies.
- Young man remove yourself.
- How are you, sir?
I don't know. Get along, get along.
- I changed my mind. I will stay for lunch.
- Another place, Edward.
- Hello, Kittredge.
- How are you, Haven? Just Damon and Pythias.
No. Grant and Lee.
You don't look as well as when I last saw you, Kittredge.
Oh, you poor fellow, I know just how you feel.
- How's it coming?
- Oh, beautifully, Dexter.
We're so indebted to you for these lovely people.
It's almost impossible to repay that debt.
But you'll manage, Red?
- They grew up together, you know.
- How nice.
You don't look old enough to get married, not even the first time.
She needs trouble to mature her. Give her lots of it.
- I'm afraid she can't count on me for that.
- No? That's too bad.
For your sake, you should have stuck to me longer.
I thought it was for life, but the nice judge gave me a full pardon.
That's the old redhead, no bitterness, no recrimination, just a swift left to the jaw.
They grew up together.
Luncheon is served, madam.
Thank you, Edward. Come, Seth. We have so much to talk about.
I don't suppose a man ever had a better or finer family.
I often wake up in the night and say:
"Seth, you lucky dog, what have you done to deserve it all?"
And what have you?
Oh, thank you.
How stupid of me.
Oh, dear, how awful!
Oh, dear, I had a feeling that would happen.
Your camera.
Well, I'm so, so sorry.
I'm sure you are.
- What is it?
- Your father.
Uncle Willie!
- Uncle Willie, how nice.
- I beg your pardon?
Please go on into lunch, everyone. I want a word with Uncle Willie.
Another place, Edward.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
You never have, but you came anyway, didn't you?
Still justice with her shining sword, daughter?
- We are, thanks to you Uncle Willie.
How long will you be researching?
Not long, if I find the right books. Family history and stuff.
- There's a cousin Joanna that's crazy.
- Who told you?
- Dinah. - Dinah should know.
Come across when you finish, Miss Hobson's.
Hobson, okay.
What is thee wish?
I'm looking for some local b...
What did you say?
What is thee wish?
Local biography or history.
If thee will consult with my colleague in there.
Dost thou have a washroom?
Thank thee.
Look, I know this is a public library, but I would...
- Hello.
- Hello.
Couldn't you afford to buy my book?
- The bookstore didn't have one.
- Are you doing the right thing?
Know what happens to girls like you who read my books?
They begin to think. That's bad.
These stories are beautiful.
Why, Connor, they're almost poetry.
Well, don't kid yourself.
I can't make you out at all now.
Really?
I thought I was easy.
So did I.
But you're not.
You...
You talk so big and tough, and then you write like this.
Which is which?
Both, I guess.
No.
No, I...
I believe you put the toughness on to save your skin.
Well, you think so?
I know a little about that.
Do you?
Quite a lot.
Look, let's get out of here.
This book, it was just such a complete surprise to me.
Let's walk. It'd be much more fun.
Tell Mr. Kittredge we'll meet him at the pool.
Yes, Miss Tracy.
The story "With the Rich and Mighty," I think I liked it best.
I got it from a Spanish peasant's proverb:
"With the rich and mighty, always a little patience."
I like that.
What's the matter?
A little too rough?
A little but I'm used to it.
Tell me something, will you?
When you can do a thing like that book, how can you possibly do anything else?
You may not believe this, but there are people that must earn their living.
Of course, but people buy books, don't they?
Well, not as long as there's a library around.
That book of mine represents two solid years' work and it netted Connor something under $600.
- But that shouldn't be.
- Well, unhappily, it is.
Beautiful country around here.
- What is it all?
- Part of our place.
What about your Miss Imbrie?
Miss Imbrie's in somewhat the same fix.
She's a born painter and might be an important one, but she must eat and also prefers a roof over her head to being out in the rain and snow.
Food and a roof...
Hey, you've really got something here.
- Where?
- Well, all this.
Come on, the dressing rooms are over here.
I think you'll find everything you need.
Use any old one, but you'll find most of the junk in there.
- Yell if you need anything.
- Hey, Connor!
- Yeah? - I have an idea.
- What?
I have the most wonderful little house in Unionville.
It's up on a hill with a view that would knock you silly.
I'm never there except in the hunting season and not much then.
And I'd be so happy to know that it was of some real use to someone.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
There's a brook and a small lake no size, really and a patch of woods, and in any kind of weather it's the most wonderful...
Well, anyhow, I'm so delighted that I can offer it to you.
Well, it's terribly nice of you, but...
Heck, that's Dexter.
Look, if he comes here stand by, will you?
- I don't want to be alone with him.
- Certainly. Isn't it lucky I thought of that house?
Don't think I'd troop in every minute.
I wouldn't. I'd never come except when expressly asked to.
Well, it isn't that.
What is it?
You see, the idea of artists depending upon a patron lady bountiful has more or less gone out.
I see.
That wasn't especially kind of you, Mr. Connor.
I'm sorry to have seemed patronizing.
- Oh, well, I didn't mean...
- Please don't bother, really.
- Hello.
- Hello. Fancy seeing you here.
Orange juice?
Certainly.
Don't tell me you've forsaken your beloved whiskey and whiskeys.
No, I've just changed colors. I'm going for pale pastel shades now.
They're more becoming to me.
How about you, Mr. Connor?
You drink? Alcohol, I mean.
- Well, a little.
- A little? And you a writer?
I thought writers drank to excess and beat their wives.
At one time, I think I secretly wanted to be a writer.
Dexter, would you mind doing something for me?
- Anything. What?
- Get the heck out of here.
I couldn't do that. You need me too much.
Mind telling me just what you're hanging around for?
- No, no.
Please don't go, Mr. Connor.
- Please don't go.
- As a writer, this is right up your street.
- Don't miss a word.
I never saw you better. You're getting that fine, tawny look.
We're going to talk about me, are we?
Goody. Astonishing what money can do. Don't you agree, Mr. Connor?
Not too much, you know, just more than enough.
Take Tracy, for example. Never a blow that hasn't been softened never one that won't be softened.
It changed her shape.
She was dumpy at one time.
As it happens, I'm not interested in myself for the moment.
Not interested in yourself?
You're fascinated.
You're far and away your favorite person.
- Dexter, in case you don't know...
- She's a girl who's generous to a fault.
To a fault, Mr. Connor.
Except to other people's faults.
She never had any understanding of my deep and gorgeous thirst.
- That was your problem.
- Granted. But you took on that problem when you took me, Red.
- You were no helpmate. You were a scold.
- It was disgusting, made you unattractive.
A weakness, sure.
Strength is her religion, Mr. Connor.
She finds human imperfection unforgivable.
When I discovered my relationship to her was supposed to be not that of a loving husband and a good companion, but...
- Oh, never mind.
But that of a kind of high priest to a virgin goddess then my drinks grew deeper and more frequent, that's all.
I never considered you as that, nor myself.
You did without knowing it.
And the night you got drunk on champagne and climbed out on the roof and stood there naked with your arms out to the moon wailing like a banshee.
I never had the slightest recollection of any such thing.
I know. You drew a blank. You wanted to.
Mr. Connor, what would you...?
A nice story for Spy, incidentally.
Too bad we can't supply photos of you.
The fuss you made over that childish episode!
It was enormously important and most revealing.
The moon is also a goddess chaste and virginal.
Stop using those foul words.
- What are you trying to make me out as?
- What do you fancy yourself as?
I don't know that I fancy...
I can't believe you're going to marry Kittredge.
- How could you think of it?
- He's everything you're not.
He's been poor.
He's had to work and fight for everything and I love him as I never even began to love you.
Maybe, but I doubt it. I think it's just a swing from me.
But it's too violent a swing.
Kittredge is no great tower of strength, you know. He's just a tower.
- You hardly know him.
- To hardly know him is to know him well.
It offends my vanity to have anyone who was even remotely my wife remarry so obviously beneath her.
How dare you, in this day and age, use such an idiotic...
I'm talking about the difference in mind and spirit.
You could marry Mac the night watchman.
I'd cheer. - Kittredge is not for you.
- You bet he's for me.
He's a great man and a good man.
Already, he's of national importance.
You sound like Spy magazine talking.
But whatever he is, toots, you'll have to stick.
- He'll give you no out, as I did.
- I won't require one.
I suppose you'll still be attractive to any man of spirit.
There's something engaging about this goddess business more challenging to the male than the more obvious charms.
- Really?
- Really.
We're very vain, you know.
This citadel can and shall be taken, and I'm the boy to do it.
You seem quite contemptuous of me, all of a sudden.
No, Red. Not of you.
Never of you.
Red, you could be the finest woman on this earth.
I'm contemptuous of something you can't help or make no attempt to.
Your so-called strength.
Your prejudice against weakness, your blank intolerance.
- Is that all?
- That's the gist of it.
Because you'll never be a first-class human being or woman until you've learned to have some regard for human frailty.
It's a pity your own foot can't slip a little sometime.
But your sense of inner divinity wouldn't allow that.
This goddess must and shall remain intact.
There are more of you than people realize, a special class of the American female.
The married maidens.
- So help me, if you say another...
- I'm through, Red. I've had my say.
Well I suppose I should object to this twosome.
That would be most objectionable.
- Anytime either of you want my advice...
- We'll give you a ring.
Thanks. Do that, will you?
So long, Red.
I left you a wedding present. Sorry I hadn't any ribbon to tie it up with.
Aren't you swimming?
We haven't time. Uncle Willie wants us at 8.
Look what your friend considers a wedding present.
- Why, it's a model of the True Love.
A boat he designed and built, practically.
We sailed it down the coast of Maine the summer we were married.
My, she was yare.
Yare?
What's that mean?
It means...
What does it mean?
Easy to handle, quick to the helm, fast, bright.
Everything a boat should be until she develops dry rot.
Oh, George, to get away!
Somehow, to be useful in the world.
Useful?
You, Tracy?
Why, I'm gonna build you an ivory tower with my own two hands.
Like fun you are.
You mean you've been in one too long?
Well, I mean that and a lot of things.
We're gonna represent something, Tracy you and I and our home something straight and sound and fine.
Then perhaps your friend Mr. Haven will be somewhat less condescending.
George...
You...
You don't really mind him, do you?
I mean the fact of him?
"The fact of him"?
What do you mean?
Well, I mean...
Well, you know, that he ever was my lord and master.
That we were... I don't believe he ever was, Tracy.
Not really.
I don't believe that anyone ever was or ever will be.
That's the wonderful thing about you, Tracy.
What?
How? Well, you're like some marvelous, distant well, queen, I guess.
You're so cool and fine and always so much your own.
There's a kind of beautiful purity about you, like a statue.
- George...
- Oh, it's grand, Tracy.
It's what everybody feels about you. What I first worshipped you for from afar.
- George, listen...
- First, now and always.
Only from a little nearer now, darling.
I...
I don't want to be worshipped. I want to be loved.
Well, you're that too, Tracy.
- Oh, you're that, all right.
- I mean really loved.
But that goes without saying, Tracy.
No.
No, now it's you who doesn't see what I mean.
I...
Well, I better get dressed, dear. I hate to be late.
George?
Yes.
Oh, nothing.
Run along. I'll be dressed when you get back.
Tracy. You're Uncle Willie's guest of honor. You mustn't be late.
Your fiancé just rode out of here on two wheels.
Does he, by any chance, walk anywhere?
When he likes, I expect.
He'll take that ring tomorrow and go through center with it.
Seth, you idiot.
Very amusing, I'm sure.
Almost as amusing as the sight of you with your arm around Mother.
I find very unamusing the stupid, undignified spectacle we're making of ourselves for those two newspaper people.
- Whose fault is it?
- That's not the point.
They can publish anything they like about me, but I insist we inform Connor and the camera lady we're all aware of their purpose.
All right. I'll tell them myself.
It'd look better coming from me as at least the titular head of the family.
Of course, inasmuch as you've let us in for it.
Do keep that note out of your voice, Tracy. It's very unattractive.
How does your dancer friend talk?
- Or does she purr?
- Tracy!
- No, it's quite all right, Margaret.
- Sweet and low, dulcet, very ladylike.
You've got nerve to come back in your head-of-the-family manner and make stands and strike attitudes and criticize my fiancé give orders and mess things up...
- Stop it!
It's sickening, as if he'd done nothing at all!
Which happens to be the truth.
Anyway, it's not your affair, Tracy, if it concerns anyone.
Actually, I don't know whom it concerns, except your father.
That's very wise of you, Margaret.
Most wives fail to realize their husbands' philandering has nothing whatever to do with them.
Then what has it to do with?
A reluctance to grow old, I think.
The best mainstay a man can have as he gets along in years is a daughter.
The right kind of daughter.
How sweet.
No, I'm talking seriously about something I've thought over thoroughly.
I think a devoted young girl gives a man the illusion that youth is still his.
- Very important, I suppose.
- Oh, very, very.
Without her, he might be inclined to go in search of his youth.
It's just as important to him as it is to any woman.
But with a girl of his own, full of warmth for him full of foolish, uncritical affection...
- None of which I've got.
- None.
You have a good mind, a pretty face, a disciplined body doing what you tell it everything it takes to make a lovely woman, except the one essential.
An understanding heart.
Without that, you might as well be made of bronze.
That's an awful thing to say to anyone.
Yes, it is indeed.
- So I'm to blame for Tina Morrow, am I?
- To a certain extent, I expect you are.
You coward!
No but better that than a prig or a perennial spinster however many marriages.
- Seth! - That's too much.
- It's not enough. I'm afraid nothing is.
- What did you say I was?
- Do you want me to repeat it?
A prig and...
You mean, you think I think I'm some kind of a goddess or something?
If your ego wants it that way, yes.
Also, you've been talking like a jealous woman.
What's the matter with everyone all at once, anyhow?
- I've been asleep.
What time is it? - After 7.
Call my house. Tell them I'm on my way. You better come.
After all, you're the host "Uncle Willie."
- That's over. You're yourself. So am I.
- Have you told them?
- I shall, at the first opportunity.
My first party, and about time.
- Can I have a cocktail?
- Certainly not.
- It's a dirty gyp.
- That dress hikes up a little behind.
- No, it's me that does.
- You look adorable, Dinah.
Thanks, Tracy. Thanks ever so much.
- Tracy, you must dress.
- Let's all have a last drink.
- Sorry, I forgot.
You never drink. - Prigs don't.
- What's that?
- Nor spinsters.
- Again, please?
- Nor goddesses of any variety.
Not completely. Just a borderline case.
Mr. And Mrs. Lord, Miss Imbrie and I have something on our mind.
- Just the place for it. What?
- We'd like to say something.
I'm all ears and eyes.
You're a vision of loveliness, Miss Imbrie.
Will you have cocktail or champagne?
Oh, champagne. I've never had enough.
You will tonight.
- I'd like to say...
- No, I have something to say.
- I am Seth Lord.
- Then that makes you...
- Available.
And you are Miss Imbrie of Spy magazine.
- Now you know.
- I was going to tell you...
- Now, as to the reasons...
- Seth, we really ought to be early.
And who'll go with me in my little car?
Dinah and I. Seth, will you take Miss Imbrie and Mr. Connor?
Dinah.
I can tell there's something in the air, because I'm being taken away.
Well, I'll see you all later.
Don't do that. What's the matter?
Nothing.
Miss Imbrie?
You know, I felt exactly as though I'd been pinched.
Don't you think you weren't.
You aren't even dressed.
You go ahead.
I'll follow along with George.
What's the matter with Tracy?
You tell me, will you?
Darned if I know. I'd like to.
Well, Macaulay, if you ever happen to find out...
I'll tell you. Sure.
And remember, Mike with the rich and mighty...
Do you know what time it is?
It's after 4.
In China, it's later than that.
In China, we'd be married by now.
Or perhaps it's only yesterday.
- I'm going home after this.
- There was a Chinese poet who was drowned while trying to kiss the moon in the river.
- He was drunk.
- I'd say as much.
But he wrote beautiful poetry.
Macaulay Connor of South Bend reporting for duty.
We're going home after this dance.
You can't do that to me, not a friend of old Junius.
- I mean, not an old friend of Junius.
- I wish old Junius were here.
Tracy, I'll get your wraps.
He'll wrap me up.
- Hello, you.
- Hello. - Hey, you look fine.
- I feel fine.
Good, good.
Oh, wait. Wait.
What was I saying?
Let's have a drink. Or would Kittredge spank?
- That's not what you were saying.
- It isn't?
All right.
Not what I was saying...
I know. Why do you wish your brother was here?
- He likes Kittredge?
- Everybody likes Kittredge.
Everybody likes Kittredge.
Everybody except C.K. Dexter Haven?
- Come on, Connor. We'll have some wine.
- We'll have some wine.
Mother!
I thought you'd gone home ages ago.
I should have, but I've been having such a good time.
- Everybody should have a good time.
- Darling, what's come over you?
It's just that a lot of things I always thought were terribly important I find now are...
And the other way around...
Oh, what the dickens.
Connor, you're thirsty, and the night is young.
- Here we are, dear.
- We'll have one more...
- Not you, I'm afraid, dear.
- Why should you be afraid, George?
Wine never affects me, not in the slightest.
What she really wants, George, is another dance with you.
- Very well.
- George, if it's that much of a chore...
- Not for me!
- Oh, no, you've been too attentive.
George, please.
What will the neighbors think?
- The course of true love...
- Gathers no moss.
- Bunny, where's Brenda?
- She's with Gigs and Phee.
No, Brenda's with John.
Boy, champagne.
Just the bottle.
I'm going on a picnic.
You're leaving us?
- Rather, but I'll be back.
- Come on, darling.
Champagne, and again and again and again.
Follow that cab.
- What cab, sir?
- No cab.
Some joke, huh?
- Take me to the Dexter Haven mansion.
- Mr. Haven?
Front entrance.
C.K. Dexter Haven!
Oh, C.K. Dexter Haven!
C.K. Dexter Haven!
This is where Cinderella gets off.
Hurry back to the ball before you turn into a pumpkin and six white mice. Goodbye.
C.K. Dexter Haven.
Oh, C.K. Dexter Haven! - What's up?
- You are.
- I only hope it's worth it. Come on in.
- I bring you greetings.
Cinderella's slipper.
It's called champagne. Champagne is a great leveler.
Leveler. It makes you my equal.
- Well, I wouldn't quite say that.
- Well, almost my equal.
C.K. Dexter Haven, I would like to talk to you.
Well, let's go in the talking room.
- Don't tell me the party's over so soon.
- No, no. I just felt like talking to you.
Well, that's nice.
I wonder if I might borrow a drink.
Certainly. Coals to Newcastle.
Here. Sit down.
Excuse me.
What's this?
- What's that, my book?
- Yes. C.K. Dexter Haven, you have unsuspected depth.
- Oh, thanks, old chap.
- But have you read it?
I was trying to stop drinking. I read anything.
- And did you stop drinking?
- Yes. Your book didn't do it, though.
Are you still in love with her?
Or perhaps you consider that a very personal question.
- Not at all.
- Liz thinks you are.
Liz thinks you are, but of course, women like to romanti...
Romanticize about things.
- Yes, they do, don't they?
- Yes, they do, don't they?
I can't understand how you could've been married to her and know so little about her.
- Can't you?
- No, I can't you.
I have the hiccups.
- I wonder if I might have another.
- Certainly.
Thank you.
You know, Tracy's no ordinary woman and you said things to her this afternoon I resented.
- I apologize, Mr. Connor.
- That's quite all right.
But when a girl is like Tracy, she's one in a million.
She's sort of like a...
She's sort of like a...
- A goddess?
- No, no, no!
You said that word this afternoon.
No, she's...
She's sort of like a queen.
A radiant, glorious queen.
And you can't treat her like other women.
No, I suppose not.
- I imagine Kittredge appreciates all that.
- Kittredge?
! Kittredge appreciates Kittredge!
That fake man of the people.
He isn't even smart.
He's a five-cent edition of Sidney Kidd.
Well, I always thought Kidd himself was the five-cent Kidd.
And what's that make you worth, C.K. Dexter Haven?
- Bringing us down here?
- You know why I did that.
To get even with my ex-bride. You told me yourself.
Doggone it, C.K. Dexter Haven, either I'm gonna sock you or you're gonna sock me.
Shall we toss a coin?
You know, Kidd is just using you like he uses everybody else.
You don't know Kidd like I know him.
The guy's colossal. He's terrific.
- Got everybody fooled.
- Yes.
No mean Machiavelli is smiling, cynical Sidney Kidd.
The world's his oyster, with an R in every month.
- That's not bad. When did I say that?
- You didn't. I did.
Sorry. You never heard about Kidd's arrangement in Kansas City?
- No.
- In San Francisco?
Let me tell you about the time he went to Boston to be awarded the Sarah Langley Medal for World Peace.
The true story on that little jaunt would ruin him.
Look, Connor, what would happen to you if I used this?
- Why?
- I might want to very much.
You see, Kidd is holding a dirty piece on Tracy's father. This might stop him.
- On Tracy's father?
- That's right.
Oh, so that's how Kidd got you to...
That's how Liz and I were gotten in. Blackmail, huh?
We all rode into this thing on a filthy blackmail.
Well, look, you use it with my blessings. I'm cooked. I'm through anyway.
I'm not gonna hand in a story on this wedding. I'm gonna write one on Kidd.
No, let me. I don't have to tell him where I got my facts, okay?
- Okay.
- All right. Come on.
Now, shoot.
Peace medal. Boston.
The time:
May 1938. The place:
Boston, a hotel.
Kidd had just arrived.
And this same Sidney Kidd, ladies and gentlemen of America this protector of American democracy and homes and firesides was at that moment entertaining this South Carolina Mata Hari on his yacht.
Don't interrupt me!
This Sidney Kidd, ladies and gentlemen, who demanded the respect of all who were connected with him...
We've come for the body of Macaulay Connor.
- Can you use a typewriter?
- No, thanks, I have one at home.
Who's that?
Here was Sidney Kidd, ladies and gentlemen.
Kidd the good, Kidd the noble...
- Where's Kittredge?
- People's choice?
His bride just dropped him at the gatehouse after a slight explosion.
- What, a fight?
- Fifteen rounds. No decision.
Where's my wandering parakeet?
You look beautiful, Red.
Come on in.
Why?
No particular reason. A drink maybe?
I don't drink.
That's right. I forgot.
I haven't.
Show Liz to a typewriter and stand back.
- Can she do it?
- She can and she will.
- You dictate to her and bring her home.
- Aren't you coming?
- I've got to commit suicide first.
- Going my way, miss?
- Miss Goddess to you.
- Okay, Miss Goddess to me.
That champagne's funny stuff. I'm used to whiskey.
Whiskey is a slap on the back, and champagne's heavy mist before my eyes.
Do you hear a telephone ringing?
I did a little while ago. Let's see.
No, not yet.
Now I do. Far away.
It's my bedroom telephone.
Couldn't be anyone but George.
I was sort of swinish to him.
Perhaps I'd better go and see what...
It isn't ringing anymore.
I tell you what let's have a quick swim to brighten us up.
- Dexter and I always swam after parties.
- Let's dip into this instead, huh?
- Hello, you.
- Hello.
- You look fine.
- I feel fine.
- Did you enjoy the party?
- Sure, sure.
The prettiest sight in this pretty world is the privileged class enjoying its privileges.
- You're a snob, Connor.
- No doubt, no doubt.
Awash with champagne was Will Q. Tracy's pleasure dome on the nuptial eve of Tracy Samantha...
Tracy Samantha...
Tracy you can't marry that guy.
George?
I'm going to.
- Why not?
- Well, I don't know.
I thought I'd be for it at first, but you just don't match up.
Then the fault's with me.
Maybe so, but all the same, you can't do it.
- No?
- No.
Come around about noon tomorrow...
I mean today.
Snob.
- You're the worst kind there is an intellectual snob. - What do you mean, snob?
You made up your mind awfully young, it seems to me.
Thirty's about time to make up your mind, and I'm nothing of the sort, not Connor.
The time to make up your mind about people is never.
Yes, you are. And a complete one.
- You're quite a girl.
- You think?
- I know.
- Thank you, professor.
- I don't think I'm exceptional.
- You are.
I know any number like me.
- You ought to get around more.
Within the upper class?
No, no.
No, thank you.
You're just a mass of prejudices, aren't you?
You're so much thought and so little feeling, professor.
- Oh, I am, am I?
- Yes, you am, are you.
Your intolerance infuriates me.
I should think that of all people a writer would need tolerance.
The fact is, you'll never...
You can't be a first-rate writer or a first-rate human being, until you've learned to have some small regard for human frai...
Aren't the geraniums pretty, professor?
Is it not a handsome day that begins professor?
- Yes, professor.
- You've got all the arrogance of your class, haven't you?
What have classes to do with it?
What do they matter except for people in them?
George comes from the so-called lower class, Dexter, the upper.
Well? Mac the night watchman is a prince, Uncle Willie is a pincher.
Upper and lower, my eye. I'll take the lower, thanks.
If you can't get a drawing room.
- What do you mean?
- My mistake.
- Decidedly. You're insulting!
- Sorry.
- Oh, don't apologize.
- Well, who's apologizing?
I never knew such a man.
You wouldn't be likely to from where you sit.
Talk about arrogance.
- Tracy.
- What do you want?
You're wonderful.
There's a magnificence in you, Tracy.
Now I'm getting self-conscious.
It's funny. I...
Mike, let's...
Yeah?
I don't know.
Go up, I guess. It's late.
The magnificence that comes out of your eyes and your voice and the way you stand there and the way you walk.
You're lit from within, Tracy.
You've got fires banked down in you.
Hearth fires and holocausts.
I don't seem to you made of bronze?
No, you're made out of flesh and blood.
That's the blank, unholy surprise of it.
Why, you're the golden girl, Tracy, full of life and warmth and delight.
Well, what goes on?
You've got tears in your eyes.
Shut up. Shut up.
Oh, Mike, keep talking, keep talking.
Talk, will you?
No, no, I...
I've stopped.
Why?
Has your mind taken hold again, dear professor?
Good thing, don't you agree?
- No, professor.
- Lay off that "professor" stuff.
- Now, do you hear me?
- Yes, professor.
- It's really all I am to you?
- Of course.
- Are you sure?
- Why, yes, of course...
Golly.
- Golly Moses!
- Tracy.
- Mr. Connor...
- Let me tell you...
- I've got the shakes.
- It can't be love, can it?
No, no, it mustn't be. It can't.
- Would it be inconvenient?
- Terribly.
Anyway, I know it isn't.
- We're out of our minds.
- And into our hearts.
- That ought to have music.
- It does, doesn't it?
You're lovely.
It's as if my insteps were melting away.
What is it?
Have I got feet of clay or something?
It's not far to the pool. It's just over the lawn, and it'll be lovely.
- You're tremendous.
- Put me in your pocket, Mike.
Oh, I can't imagine what makes me so sleepy.
- Couldn't be the company, could it?
- Well, it's you, Mr. Dexter.
- Hello, Mac.
- I heard you were about.
- Any prowlers around? - No, no.
No prowlers.
- Can Miss Imbrie get in this way?
- If she can't, you can go in the back.
- Thanks, Mac. Good night.
- Good night, sir.
Well, home after a hard day's blackmailing.
When are you gonna telephone Kidd?
In time to get him here for the wedding.
Why?
A sort of wedding present.
If it works.
If it works.
I could still tear it up.
No. Mike's only chance to ever become a really fine writer is to get fired.
You're a good number, Liz.
Oh, I just photograph well.
I'm certainly out of focus now.
Why don't you take a swim?
- A swim?
- Sure.
Tracy and I always took a swim after a party.
Did you?
Bet it was fun.
I'll have to try it with Mike sometime.
Liz why don't you marry him?
You really want to know?
He's still got a lot to learn.
I don't want to get in his way for a while.
- Okay?
- Okay.
It's risky, though, Liz.
Suppose another girl came along in the meantime?
I'd scratch her eyes out, I guess.
That is, unless she was going to marry somebody else the next day.
Hey!
- Hello, Kittredge.
- What are you doing here?
Friend of the family's. Dropped in for a chat.
Don't be funny. I asked you a question.
I could ask you the same question.
I telephoned Tracy, and her phone didn't answer.
I was worried, so I walked over.
I was worried too.
- About what?
- What do you think of this fellow Connor?
- Or do you?
- If you're trying to insinuate...
My dear chap, I wouldn't insinuate anything, only...
- I'd advise you to go to bed.
- I don't want your advice.
- I'm staying here.
- You're making a mistake.
- Somehow I don't think you'll understand.
- You better leave that to...
What's that?
That's Mac, always singing. I'll walk you around the house.
Something's going on here, and I'm staying.
And so are you.
All right, then.
Take the works. Only heaven help you.
Don't stop, Mikey. Keep crooning.
- What is this?
- Easy, old man.
She's not hurt?
- No, no.
- Not wounded, sire, but dead.
Seems the minute she hit the water, the wine hit her.
- Now, look here, Connor...
- A likely story, Connor.
- What'd you say?
- I said, a likely story.
- Listen...
- You'll be down directly?
- Yes, if you want.
- I want.
Hello, Dexter.
Hello, George.
Hello, Mike.
Second door, top of the stairs. Don't wake Dinah.
My feet are made of clay, made of clay.
Did you know?
Good night, Mother.
How are the mighty fallen.
Well, if I know Tracy, and I know her well, she'll remember little of this.
For the second time in her life, she'll draw quite a tidy blank.
- You don't believe it, then?
- Believe what?
Well, the...
The implications of what you saw, let us say.
Well, what else am I to believe?
- That's entirely up to you.
- I got eyes. I got imagination, haven't I?
I don't know. Have you?
Oh, so you pretend not to believe it?
Yes, I pretend not to.
Then you don't know women.
- Possible.
- And you're a fool.
Well, that's quite possible.
- You won't be too hard on her?
- I'll make up my own mind.
- We're all only human, you know.
- You...
All of you, with your sophisticated ideas.
Ain't it awful?
Well?
Why, you low...
- Say, listen, what right have you...?
- A husband's. Till tomorrow, Kittredge.
Oi.
Oi, fella.
How do you feel?
- Now, look, if you think I...
- I know. I'm sorry.
I thought I'd better hit you before he did. He's in better shape than I am.
Well, you'll do.
Hello, Mr. Dexter. Anything wrong?
- Not a thing. Just as quiet as a church.
- Who is it?
Doggone, I thought it might have been Mr. Kittredge.
Well, we can't have everything, Mac.
Good night.
Mr. Tracy.
Good grief, man, don't scream at me at the top of your voice.
Miss Dinah is waiting for you, sir.
Miss Dinah, waiting for me?
Where and why?
Just outside the door. I don't know why.
This is one of those days which the pages of history teach us are best spent lying in bed.
- Yes, sir.
Uncle Willie!
Uncle Willie!
Where are you going?
Back to bed unless you give me your oath you'll speak in a civilized tone.
I'll be quiet, Uncle Willie.
It's so important that I see you.
Must we ride in that?
Wouldn't we be more comfortable on pogo sticks?
I had to be alone with you, and this is very intimate.
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing much.
My head just fell off, that's all.
What is all this gibberish about Mr. Connor?
What makes you suspect what, and since when?
Last night and well into the morning.
Uncle Willie, isn't my duty to tell George?
- He might want to marry her anyway.
- But she can't.
If she marries anyone, it's got to be Mr. Connor.
Why, Dinah, what makes you think she should?
Apparently the little cherub has heard or seen something.
That's Dexter's own Dinah.
You have a certain amount of cheek, walking in here on this of all mornings.
- Do I?
- Yes.
What's all this about Mr. Connor?
Did the party last night give you bad dreams?
It wasn't any dream.
It's hard to tell once you've gone to sleep, isn't it?
Is it?
What, ho, the bride.
Tracy.
Hello.
Isn't it a fine day, though?
Is everybody fine?
That's fine.
My, I'm hearty.
How do you feel otherwise?
I don't know what's the matter with me. I must have had too much sun yesterday.
- My eyes don't open properly.
- Really?
Please go home, Dext.
Not until we've got those eyes open.
Uncle Willie. Good morning.
That remains to be seen.
- Aren't you here early, Uncle Willie?
- It's nearly half past 12.
Well, it can't be. Where's Mother?
She's talking with the orchestra, Father with the minister.
And Mr. Connor, he hasn't come down yet.
- And it's your wedding day, remember?
- Thanks loads. It's nice to have things...
- I wonder what this might be.
- Looks terribly like a watch.
But whose?
I found it in my room. I nearly stepped on it.
Also, I think I was robbed at your house last night, Uncle Willie.
- My bracelet and engagement rings are...
- Here you are.
- But you weren't at the party.
- Wasn't I?
- Were you?
- Now, don't tell me you don't remember.
I do. Now.
Sort of.
But there were such a lot of people. I stayed so late.
Should've taken a swim when you got home.
A swim?
A swim?
There. Now they're open.
That was just the beginning, and it was no dream.
- Speaking of eye-openers...
- First sane remark I've heard today.
I know a formula said to pop the pennies off the eyelids of dead Irishmen.
Dinah, if the conversation should lag, you might tell Tracy about your dream.
Oh, nothing.
Tray, I hate you to get married and go away.
I'll miss you, darling. I'll miss all of you.
You know, I did have the funniest dream about you last night.
Did you?
Do you like my dress, Dinah?
- Yes, ever so much.
- Feels awfully heavy.
- It was all certainly pretty rooty-tooty.
- What was?
- My dream.
- Oh, Dinah.
I dreamed I got up and went over to the window.
Guess what I dreamed I saw coming out of the woods?
I haven't the faintest idea. A skunk?
Well, sort of.
- It was Mr. Connor.
- Mr. Connor?
Yes. With his both arms full of something, and guess what it turned out to be.
- What?
- You. And some clothes.
Wasn't it funny?
It was sort of like as if you were coming from the pool.
The pool?
I'm going crazy. I'm standing here solidly on my own two hands and going crazy.
- Then what?
- Then after a while I opened my door a crack, and there he was still coming along with you, puffing like a steam engine.
- His wind can't be very good.
- Then what?
- Then you were sort of crooning.
- I never crooned in my life.
I'm only saying what it sounded like.
And then he...
Guess what.
- I couldn't possibly.
- He sailed right into your room with you.
That scared me, so I got up and went to your door and peeked in to make sure you were all right.
And guess what.
- What?
- You were. He was gone by then.
Gone?
Of course he was gone. He was never there.
- I know, Tracy.
- I should certainly hope you did.
I'm certainly glad I do.
Because if I didn't, and in a little while I heard the minister say:
"If anyone knows any just cause or reason why these two should not be united in holy matrimony..." I just wouldn't know what to do.
Dexter says it's a dream too.
- You told Dexter all that?
- Not a word, not a single word.
You know how quick he is.
- Dinah, you little fiend, how can you...?
- Dinah.
- Your mother wants to have a look at you.
- I look wonderful. I smell good too.
- Father?
- Yes, Tracy?
I...
I'm glad you came back.
I'm glad you're here.
Why, thank you, child.
I'm sorry I'm...
Truly sorry I'm a disappointment to you.
I never said that, daughter and I never will.
Good morning.
Hello.
Testing the air.
I like it, but it doesn't like me.
- Hello, Dinah.
- How do you do?
- Did you have a good sleep?
- Wonderful, wonderful.
Marvelous. Have you ever seen a handsomer day?
Never, never.
What did it set you back?
- I got it for nothing. For being a good girl.
- Good, good.
Don't worry, I'm going.
Why should you?
Well, I guess you must have things you wish to discuss.
Only remember it's getting late.
She's always trying to make situations.
Well.
Well.
- What's the matter with your chin?
- Does it show very much?
- A little. What happened?
I guess I stuck it out too far.
Into a door in the dark?
Yes, yes.
That's it. Tracy, what about you?
You all right?
Me?
Oh, of course.
Why shouldn't I be?
Well, that was a flock of wine we got away with.
I guess we're lucky both to have such good heads.
Yeah, yeah I guess that's it.
Well, anyway I had a simply wonderful evening.
- I hope you enjoyed it too.
- I enjoyed the last part of it.
Really?
Why especially the last?
Well, Tracy, are you asking me?
- Oh, you mean the swim.
- Well...
We did swim and so forth, didn't we?
- Mike.
- Oh, Tracy, darling.
- Mike.
- What can I say?
Tell me, darling.
Not anything.
Don't say anything, and especially not "darling."
- Then you're going through with it?
- With what?
The wedding.
Why shouldn't I?
Well, I made a funny discovery.
In spite of the fact somebody's up from the bottom he can still be a heel.
And even though somebody else is born to the purple he can still be a very nice guy.
Well, I'm just repeating what you said last night.
I said a lot of things last night, it seems.
Okay. No dice.
Also no regrets about last night, huh?
Why should I have?
- Tracy, you're wonderful.
- You don't know what I mean.
I'm asking you. Tell me straight out. Tell me the reason I should have had.
No, don't.
Just tell me what time is it?
What...?
Oh, I wonder what happened to my wristwatch.
Why, is it broken?
I must have lost it someplace.
I can't tell you how extremely sorry I am to hear that.
There. On the table.
I wonder who found it. I'd offer a reward or something.
I don't think that any reward will be expected.
Funny it would pop up here, isn't it?
Hey, what about an eye-opener, huh?
My eyes are opened.
- Go ahead and get one if you want.
- I think I will.
All right.
Yes, yes.
No, just give Mr. Kittredge a message.
Tell him he'd better start immediately.
Thank you.
- Are you one of the musicians?
Of course. You're Junius' friend. Only you're not.
You don't have any violin strings, do you?
- Aspirin. Will that do?
- I don't think so. It's for a violin.
Oh, well. Don't bother.
Oh, dear.
- Hello, Connor. How are you?
- Just about as you'd think.
- You seen Kidd?
- I left a copy of it at my house for him.
- And?
- We'll have it out after the wedding.
- Is that an alcoholic beverage?
- For me?
- It's for Tracy. Want one?
I'd sell my grandmother for a drink. You know I love my grandmother.
Uncle Willie's in the pantry doing weird and wonderful things.
Tell him I said one of the same.
Mind if I make it two?
That's between you and your grandmother.
Doctor's orders, Red.
What is it?
Just the juice of a few flowers.
It's a type of stinger. It removes the sting.
Oh, Dext, don't say that.
- Well, why not, Red?
- Nothing will. Nothing ever can.
Oh, Dext, I...
I've done the most terrible thing to you.
To me?
Oh, I doubt that. I doubt it very much, dear.
- You don't know. You don't know.
- Well, maybe I shouldn't, huh?
But you must. You've got to. I couldn't stand it if you didn't.
Dext, what am I going to do?
But why to me, darling?
Why ask me?
Why do I come into it anymore?
Aren't you confusing me with a fellow named Kittredge or something?
- George!
- George.
Splendid chap, George.
Very high morals. Very broad shoulders.
- I've got to tell him.
- Tell him what, darling?
I've got to tell him.
We've got to tell him.
If he's got brains, he'll see what a fool he made of himself.
How?
Hello, George?
This...
I don't care whether it's bad luck or not, I've got to see you before the wedding.
What?
No, I didn't get it.
Right, right.
Come on the run.
- He sent a note over at 10:00.
- Good. I told you he'd come to his senses.
- Was he here too?
- Sure.
Good golly, why didn't you sell tickets?
Say something, Dext.
Say anything.
- No, you do.
- Oh, Dext.
I'm such an unholy mess of a girl.
Well, that's no good. That's not even conversation.
But never in my life not if I live to be 100, will I forget how you tried to stand me on my feet again today.
- Oh, you?
You're in great shape.
Tell me, what did you think of my wedding present?
I like my presents at least acknowledged.
It was beautiful.
And sweet, Dext.
Yes, yeah.
She was quite a boat, the True Love, wasn't she?
Was and is.
My, she was yare.
She was yare, all right.
I wasn't, was I?
Not very.
Oh, you were good at the brightwork, though.
I made her shine.
Where is she now?
I'm gonna sell it to Ruth Watress.
You're going to sell the True Love?
- For money?
- Sure.
- To that fat old rum pot?
- Oh, well, what does it matter?
When you're through with a boat, you're through.
Besides, it was only comfortable for two people.
Unless you want her.
No.
No, I don't want her.
Well, I'm designing another one anyway, along more practical lines.
What will you call her?
I thought the True Love II. What do you think?
If you call any boat that, I promise I'll blow you and it out of the water.
- I'll tell you what you can call her.
In fond remembrance of me.
The Easy Virtue.
Shut up, Red. I can't have you thinking things like that.
What am I supposed to think when I...?
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.
That sounds very hopeful, Red.
That sounds just fine.
Tracy?
We're almost ready.
Stand up, dear. Turn around.
Oh, yes, it's lovely. I'm glad we decided against...
You shouldn't be here.
Against the blue one, dear. Now, no games, Dexter.
George will be right over. I just phoned. Here's a note he sent this morning.
Oh, dear, doesn't everything look lovely?
Dr. Parsons.
Tracy?
Mr. Kittredge hasn't arrived yet, Dr. Parsons.
I want you to meet Tracy's grandmother.
Now, Tracy, don't sit down again until after the ceremony.
Dexter, they phoned from your house that a Mr. Kidd was there.
I was to tell you that he's reading it. Whatever on earth does that mean?
I have a feeling it won't be so hard for me to resign now.
And belts will be worn tighter this winter.
Well, Red, I'm afraid it's the deadline.
So is this. Listen:
"I want you to know you will always be my friend but your conduct was so shocking to my ideals of womanhood..."
No, don't go. You might as well hear it too.
"That my attitude toward you and the prospect of a happy and useful life together has been changed materially.
- Your breach of common decency..."
- Tracy.
Hello, George.
Tracy, all these people.
It's only a letter from a friend.
They're my friends too.
"...certainly entitles me to an explanation before going through with our marriage.
In the light of day, I am sure that you will agree with me.
Otherwise, with profound regrets and all best wishes, yours very sincer..."
Yes, George, I quite agree with you.
In the light of day and the dark of night for richer, for poorer, for better, for worse in sickness and in health, and...
Thank you so very much for your good wishes at this time.
- That's all you have to say?
- What else?
I wish for your sake as well as mine I had an explanation but unfortunately, I've none.
You better just say good riddance, George.
- It isn't easy, you know.
- I don't see why.
- Say something, stupid.
- Just wait a minute.
What for?
On the eve of your wedding, an affair.
I agree. I'll tell you again, good riddance to me.
- Your attitude is difficult to understand.
- Yes, I can see that it would be.
- Not necessarily.
- You keep out of this.
You forget I am out of it.
Kittredge it may interest you that this so-called affair consisted of two kisses and a swim.
- Thanks, Mike, but...
Which I enjoyed, and the memory of which I wouldn't part with for anything.
- It's no use, Mike.
- After which I placed Tracy on her bed and promptly returned down here to you two, which doubtless you remember.
Doubtless, without a doubt.
- You mean that was all there was to it?
- I do.
Why?
Was I so unattractive?
So distant?
So forbidding or something?
- This is fine talk too.
- I'm asking a question.
You were extremely attractive.
As for distant and forbidding on the contrary, but you also were a little the worse, or better, for wine and there are rules about that.
Thank you, Mike.
I think men are wonderful.
The little dears.
I fail to see the humor in this situation, Miss Imbrie.
I can appreciate that. It was hard for me too, at first.
- Oh, Liz, I...
- Oh, it's all right.
We all go haywire at times.
And if we don't, maybe we ought to.
Liz...
You see, it really wasn't Tracy at all, Mr. Kittredge.
It was another girl, a Miss Pommery, 1926.
You'd had too much to drink, Tracy.
That seems to be the consensus of opinion.
Will you promise me never to touch the stuff again?
No, George.
I don't believe I will.
There are certain things about that other girl that Miss Pommery, '26, I rather like.
- But a man expects his wife... - To behave herself, naturally.
To behave herself naturally.
Sorry.
But if it hadn't been for that drink, all this might not have happened.
Apparently, nothing did.
- What made you think it had?
- Well, it didn't take much imagination.
Not much, perhaps, but just of a certain kind.
Seems you didn't think well of yourself.
That's the odd thing, George.
I'd have hoped you'd think better of me than I did.
I'm not going to quibble. The evidence was there.
And I was guilty straight off. Until I was proved innocent.
- Downright un-American, if you ask me.
- Nobody is asking you.
You forgot your hat, Miss Tracy.
Oh, you look lovely, Miss Tracy.
All our very best wishes.
I wish you'd let me know when you invite people to Tracy's weddings.
- Why?
What happened, darling?
- A Mr. Kidd is here, says he knows you.
Sidney Kidd is here himself?
What else did Sidney Kidd have to say?
He sent the strangest message.
He said, "Tell Haven he wins. Tell him I'm licked."
- Wins what, Dexter?
- Well, it's...
Mr. Sidney Kidd's presence here makes the marriage of national importance.
I think it's extremely kind and thoughtful of him.
Come on, Tracy. It must be late.
Let's let bygones be bygones. What do you say?
Yes, and goodbye, George.
- I don't understand you.
- Please.
- Look...
- You're too good for me.
- You're 100 times too good.
- I never...
I'd make you most unhappy, most.
That is, I'd do my best to.
Well, if that's the way you want it.
That's the way it is.
All right.
Possibly, it's just as well.
Yes, I thought you'd finally come to that conclusion.
I've a feeling you had more to do with this than anyone.
- Possibly, but you were a great help.
- You and your whole rotten class.
Class, my eye.
You're on your way out, the lot of you, and good riddance!
There goes George.
Oh, my sainted aunt!
- That welter of faces.
- Oh, my, they look solemn.
What am I to do?
- Tracy?
- Yes, Mike?
Old Parsons, he's never seen Kittredge, has he?
Now, look, I got you into this thing and I'll get you out of it.
Will you marry me, Tracy?
No, Mike.
Thanks, but nope.
I've never asked a girl to marry me before. I've avoided it.
But you've got me all confused now. Why not?
Because I don't think Liz would like it and I'm not sure you would and I'm even a little doubtful about myself.
But I am beholden to you, Mike. I'm most beholden.
But they're in there. They're waiting.
Don't get too conventional all at once, will you?
There'll be a reaction.
Cheer up, Red. It'll be all right. You've been got out of jams before.
- Been got out of them, did you say?
- Certainly. Don't worry, you always have.
- Tracy.
- Mother...
We've seen George. It's all right, dear.
Your father will make an announcement.
Is there anything special you want me to say?
No, no.
I'll say it.
Whatever it is, I'll say it. I won't be got out of anything anymore, thanks.
I...
I...
I...
Hello. Good morning.
Stop that music.
I'm terribly sorry to have kept you waiting but there's been a slight hitch in the proceedings.
I've made a terrible fool of myself, which isn't unusual and my fiancé...
My fiancé that was, that is he thinks we better call it a day, and I quite agree with him.
Peace, it's wonderful.
Dexter, Dexter, what next?
"Two years ago, I did you out of a wedding by eloping to Maryland."
Two years ago, you were invited...
Now, dear, just a loan. Here, put this ring in your vest pocket.
- Don't have a vest.
- Then hold it in your hand.
- "Which was bad manners."
- Which was bad manners.
"I hope to make it up to you by going through with it now."
But I hope to make it up to you by...
By going beautifully through with it now as originally and most beautifully planned.
- "So if you'll keep your seats..."
- So if you'll keep your seats...
- That's all.
- That's all.
- Are you sure?
- I'll risk it. Will you?
You bet.
You didn't do it to soften the blow or save my face?
- It's a nice little face.
- I'll be yare now. I'll promise.
Be whatever you like. Are you all set?
- All set.
- Best man?
Honored, C.K.
- Maid of honor?
- Matron of honor. Remember Joe Smith.
Oh, how did this ever happen?
Better tell Mr. Dutton to start the music.
This can't be happening. It can't.
But come with me.
- Let's get in there. Got the ring?
- Yeah. We look like stowaways.
See you soon, Red.
See you soon, Dext.
- Tracy, darling.
- I love you, Father.
- I love you too, Tracy.
- Never have I been so full of love before.
Come along. Come along.
Wait. How do I look?
Like a queen. Like a goddess.
- And you know how I feel?
- How?
Like a human. Like a human being.
- Do you know how I feel?
- How?
Proud.
I did it. I did it all.
I feel as though I lived through all this before in another life.
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires Will come to you
If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in And sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams Come true
Pretty.
I'll bet a lot of you folks don't believe that, about a wish coming true, do you?
Well, I didn't either.
Of course, I'm just a cricket singing my way from hearth to hearth, but let me tell you what made me change my mind.
One night a long time... Pardon me.
Wait till I fix this thing.
There.
One night a long time ago, my travels took me to a quaint little village.
It was a beautiful night.
The stars were shining like diamonds, high above the roofs of that sleepy old town.
Pretty as a picture.
As I wandered along the crooked streets, there wasn't a soul to be seen.
The only sign of life was a lighted window in the shop of a wood-carver named Geppetto.
So I hopped over and looked in.
It was a shame to see a nice cheerful fire like that going to waste.
So what do I do?
I go in!
I looked around.
Of course, being in a strange place like that,
I didn't know what to expect.
A cricket can't be too careful, you know.
Soon as I saw there was no one about, I made myself at home.
As I stood there warming my...
...myself, I took a look around.
Well, sir, you never saw such a place.
The most fantastic clocks you ever laid your eyes on, and all carved out of wood.
And cute little music boxes, each one a work of art.
And shelf after shelf of toys and...
And then something else caught my eye.
A puppet!
You know, one of those marionette things, all strings and joints.
Cute little fellow.
Going up?
Good piece of wood too.
Well, now, it won't take much longer.
Just a little more paint and he's all finished.
I think he'll be all right. Don't you, Figaro?
Beg pardon.
See?
That makes a big difference.
Very good.
Very, very good.
Well, you can't please everybody.
Now I have just the name for you.
Pinocchio!
Do you like it, Figaro?
No?
You do, don't you, Cleo?
Well, we'll leave it to little woodenhead.
Do you like it?
That settles it!
Pinocchio it is!
Come on, now, we'll try you out.
Music, Professor!
Take it easy there!
Break it up, will you?
Lotta down beats in there.
Little woodenhead go play your part
Bring a little joy to every heart
Little do you know and yet it's true
That I'm mighty proud of you
Little wooden feet and best of all
Little wooden seat in case you fall
How graceful!
My little woodenhead
Cleo, meet Pinocchio.
Say, "How do you do?"
Say hello to Figaro.
Up to mischief already.
You see what happens?
Up we go!
You're a cute little fellow.
And that smile!
You know, I...
You rascal! Jealous?
You know, Pinocchio, I think Figaro is jealous of you.
Don't worry, Figaro.
I wonder what time it is?
It's getting late.
Come now. We go to bed.
Good night, Pinocchio.
Little funny face.
Good night, Cleo, my little water baby.
Figaro you say good night too.
Go on!
Now go to sleep, my little mermaid.
Good night.
This is my idea of comfort.
Solid comfort.
Look at him, Figaro.
He almost looks alive!
Wouldn't it be nice if he was a real boy?
Oh, well.
Come on. We go to sleep.
I forgot to open the window.
Figaro, look, look, the wishing star!
Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight,
I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I make tonight.
Figaro, you know what I wished?
I wished that my little Pinocchio might be a real boy.
Wouldn't that be nice?
Just think.
A real boy.
A very lovely thought, but not at all practical.
A real boy.
Quiet!
After all, enough's enough.
Now what's up?
Hey, what's going on here?
As I live and breathe, a fairy!
Good Geppetto, you have given so much happiness to others.
You deserve to have your wish come true.
Little puppet made of pine, wake.
The gift of life is thine.
What they can't do these days.
I can move!
I can talk!
I can walk!
- Yes, Pinocchio, I've given you life.
- Why?
Because, tonight, Geppetto wished for a real boy.
- Am I a real boy?
- No, Pinocchio.
To make Geppetto's wish come true will be entirely up to you.
Up to me?
Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish, and someday you will be a real boy.
A real boy!
- That won't be easy.
- You must learn to choose - between right and wrong.
- Right and wrong?
But how will I know?
- How'll he know!
- Your conscience will tell you.
- What are conscience?
- What are conscience!
I'll tell ya!
A conscience is that still, small voice that people won't listen to.
That's just the trouble with the world today.
- Are you my conscience?
- Who, me?
Would you like to be Pinocchio's conscience?
Well...
Very well.
What is your name?
Cricket's the name.
Jiminy Cricket.
Kneel, Mr. Cricket.
No tricks now.
I dub you Pinocchio's conscience.
Lord high keeper of the knowledge of right and wrong, counselor in moments of temptation and guide along the straight and narrow path.
Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket.
Well!
My, my!
Say, that's pretty swell.
Gee, thanks!
- But don't I get a badge or somethin'?
- Well, we'll see.
- You mean, maybe I will?
- I shouldn't wonder.
- Make it a gold one?
- Maybe. Now remember, Pinocchio, be a good boy.
And always let your conscience be your guide.
- Goodbye, milady.
- Goodbye.
Not bad, says I.
Oh, yeah!
Almost forgot about you.
Well, Pinoke...
Maybe you and I had better have a little heart-to-heart talk.
Why?
Well, you want to be a real boy, don't you?
All right, sit down, son.
Now, you see, the world is full of temptations.
- Temptations?
- Yep! Temptations.
They're the wrong things that seem right at the time, but even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes, sometimes the wrong things may be right at the wrong time, or vice versa.
Understand?
But I'm gonna do right.
Attaboy, Pinoke, and I'm gonna help ya.
And anytime you need me, you know, just whistle.
Like this.
Like this?
No, no. Try it again, Pinoke.
Like this?
No, son.
Now listen!
That's it!
Come on, now. Let's sing it!
When you get in trouble and you don't know right from wrong
Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
When you meet temptation and the urge is very strong
Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
Not just a little squeak Pucker up and blow
- And if your whistle's weak, yell
- Jiminy Cricket?
Take the straight and narrow path
And if you start to slide give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
And always let your conscience be your guide
Take the straight and narrow path
And if you start to slide Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
And always let your conscience be your guide
And always let your conscience be your guide
- Who is there?
- It's me.
Oh, it's me.
There's somebody in here.
Careful now, Figaro.
He might spring out on us at any time.
He's in here somewhere.
Here I am!
How did you get down here?
- I fell down.
- Oh, you did.
You are talking.
- No, no, no!
- Yes!
And I can move too!
No, no, you can't!
I'm dreaming in my sleep!
Wake me up!
Wake me up!
Now we see who's dreaming.
Go on... say something.
Gee, you're funny.
- Do it again!
- You do talk!
Yes!
The blue fairy came.
- The blue fairy?
- And I got a conscience.
- A conscience! - And, someday, I'm gonna be a real boy.
A real boy!
It is my wish, it's come true!
Figaro, look!
He's alive, he can talk!
Say hello to Figaro.
Hello to Figaro.
I almost forgot.
Look, it's Pinocchio!
She's my little water baby. Isn't she cute?
Yeah, cute!
This calls for a celebration!
Music!
You start one, Pinocchio.
Oh, boy. A party!
Mind if I cut in?
How 'bout sitting out the next one, babe?
Lemme out!
Come, Cleo, join the party!
Dance!
Nice!
Gathering toys
For my little boy
Look... pretty!
Where's the bucket?
Help! Water!
- Water! - Here it is!
I got it!
Here's water.
Here's some water.
Help!
Where's water?
That was close.
Maybe we'd better go to bed before something else happens.
Little man, you've had a busy night.
Now, close your eyes and go to sleep.
Why?
Everybody has to sleep.
Figaro goes to sleep, and Cleo.
And, besides, tomorrow you've got to go to school.
- Why?
- Oh, to learn things...
- ...and get smart.
- Why?
Because.
Look, Father. Look!
- Wait! Stand still now.
- What are those?
Oh, those!
They are your schoolmates, girls and boys.
Now get in. - Real boys?
- Yes!
But hurry now.
Wait, wait, wait!
Here's an apple for the teacher.
Now turn around and let me look you over.
Yeah, yeah.
Here.
Run along now.
Wait, wait.
Come back here, Figaro.
School is not for you.
- Goodbye, Father!
- Goodbye, son.
Hurry back.
Gideon, listen.
The merry laughter of little innocent children wending their way to school.
Thirsty little minds rushing to the fountain of knowledge.
School, a noble institution.
What would this stupid world be without...
Well, well, well!
So that old rascal's back in town?
Remember, Giddy, the time I tied strings on you and passed you off as a puppet?
We nearly put one over on that old gypsy that time!
A little wooden boy.
Now, who...
A wooden boy!
Look, Giddy, look. it's amazing.
A live puppet without strings.
A thing like that ought to be worth a fortune to someone.
Now let me see. That's it!
Stromboli!
Why, that fat, old faker would give his...
If we play our cards right, we'll be on easy street, or my name isn't Honest John.
Quick! We'll head him off.
Now's our...
No, no, stupid.
Don't be crude.
Let me handle this.
Here he comes.
Yes, Giddy, as I was saying to the duchess only yesterday...
How clumsy of me!
My, my, my.
I'm terribly sorry.
- I do hope you're not injured.
- I'm all right.
Splendid!
Well, well. Quite a scholar, I see.
Look, Giddy, a man of letters.
- Here's your book.
- I'm going to school.
School!
Ah, yes.
Then you haven't heard of the easy road to success.
No?
I'm speaking, my boy, of the theater!
Here's your apple.
Bright lights, music, applause!
- Fame!
- Fame?
Yes!
And with that personality, that profile, that physique...
Why, he's a natural born actor.
- But I'm going...
- Straight to the top.
Why, I can see your name in lights, lights six feet high.
- What is your name?
- Pinocchio.
Pinocchio!
P-l-N-U-O...
P-l...
We're wasting precious time.
Come. On to the theater!

Late the first day.

Oh, boy, a parade!
An actor's life for me
Hi diddle de dee An actor's life for me
A waxed moustache and a beaver coat A pony cart and a billy goat
Why, it's... it's Pinoke!
Hey, where you going?
You wear your hair in a pompadour

- You stop and buy out a candy store - Halt!

With clothes that come from the finest shop

- Oh, no, that's my conscience. He...
Why, there's nothing up there to be afraid of.
Over here.
- Over here.
- Jiminy, I'm gonna be an actor!
All right, son. Take it easy now.
Remember what I said about temptation?
- Well, that's him.
- Oh, no, Jiminy.
- That's Mr. Honest John!
- Honest John?
Get me outta here!
All right then, here's what we'll tell 'em.
You can't go to the theater.
Say, "Thank you just the same."
You're sorry, but you've got to go to school.
Here they come, Pinoke.
Now you tell 'em.
Oh, little boy!
There you are!
Where were we?
Yes... on to the theater!
Goodbye, Jiminy, goodbye!
Hi diddle dee dee An actor's life for me
- Goodbye? Pinoke, you can't go!
- A high silk hat and a silver cane
- There he goes. - A watch of gold with a diamond chain
What'll I do?
I'll run and tell his father.
No, that'd be snitching. I'll go after him myself.
Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude the performance of this great show,
Stromboli, the master showman...
That's me.
...and by special permission of the management...
That's me too.
...is presenting to you something you will absolutely refuse to believe!
Well, looks like a sellout.
Introducing the only marionette who can sing and dance absolutely without the aids of strings.
The one... and only... Pinocchio!
What a buildup.
I got no strings to hold me do...
Go ahead... make a fool of yourself!
Then, maybe, you'll listen to your conscience.
I got no strings to hold me down
To make me fret or make me frown
I had strings, but now I'm free
There are no strings on me
Heigh ho the merry-o
That's the only way to be
I want the world to know Nothing ever worries me I got no strings...
What I told you?
They got strings, but you can see
There are no strings on me
You have no strings Your arms is free
To love me by the Zuider Zee
Ya-ya-ya if you would woo
I'd bust my strings for you
You've got no strings Comme ci comme ça
Your savoir faire is ooo-la-la
I've got strings, but entre nous
I'd cut my strings for you
Down where the Volga flows
There's a Russian rendezvous
Where me and Ivan go but I'd rather go with you
There are no strings on me
They like him.
He's a success.
Maybe I was wrong.
Well, guess he won't need me anymore.
What does an actor want with a conscience anyway?
What could have happened to him?
Where could he be at this hour?
I'd better go out again and look for him.
And, remember, nobody eats a bite until I find him.
I got no strings, but I got the brain
I got no strings, but I got the brain
I buy a new suit and I swing the cane
I eat the best and I drink champagne
I got no strings on me
- Bravo, Pinocchio!
- They liked me!
Two hundred.
- You are sensational!
- You mean I'm good?
Three hundred.
You are colossal!
Does that mean I'm an actor?
Sure!
I will push you in the public's eye.
Your face, she will be on everybody's tongue.
Will she?
What's this?
For you, my little Pinocchio.
For me?
Gee, thanks!
I'll run right home and tell my father.
Home?
Oh, sure.
Going home to your father.
- That is very "comeecal."
- You mean, it's funny?
Oh, sure!
- I'll be back in the morning.
- Be back in the morning!
Going home?
There, this will be your home...
- Where I can find you always!
- No, no, no!
Yes, yes, yes!
To me... you are belonging.
We will tour the world.
Paris.
London.
Monte Carlo. "Constantinopolee."
- No, no!
- Yes!
We start tonight!
You will make lots of money... for me!
And when you are growing too old, you will make good firewood!
Let me outta here.
I gotta get out!
You can't keep me!
Quiet!
Shut up! Before I knock you silly!
Good night, my little wooden gold mine.
No!
No, wait!
Lemme out!
I'll tell my father!
Giddy up! Get along there.
Jiminy, where are you?
Well, there he goes.
Sitting in the lap of luxury, the world at his feet.
Oh, well, I can always say "I knew him when."
I'll just go out of his life quietly.
I would like to wish him luck though.
Sure!
Pinocchio?
Pinocchio?
It's me, your old friend, Jiminy.
Jiminy!
I'm glad to see ya!
Pinocchio, what's happened?
What did he do to ya?
He was mad.
He said he was gonna push my face in everybody's eye.
- And just 'cause I'm a goldbrick, he's gonna chop me into firewood!
Oh, is that so?
Now, don't you worry, son.
I'll have you outta here in no time at all.
Why, this is just as easy... ...as rolling' off a...
Kinda rusty.
Needs a little oil.
That's what I said.
Must be one of the old models.
You mean, you can't open it?
Yeah.
Looks pretty hopeless.
It'll take a miracle to get us outta here.
A fine conscience I turned out to be.
I shoulda listened to you, Jiminy.
No, it was my fault.
I shouldn't have walked out on you.
Guess I'll never see my father again.
Buck up, son. it could be worse.
Be cheerful...
like me!
Take it easy, son.
Come on, blow.
Attaboy.
Well, it stopped raining anyway.
Well, it stopped raining anyway.
Hey, that star again!
- The lady!
The fairy!
- What'll she say?
- What'll I tell her?
- You might tell her the truth.
Why, Pinocchio!
- Hello!
- Sir Jiminy!
Well! This is a pleasant surprise!
Pinocchio, why didn't you go to school?
School?
Go ahead, tell her.
I was going to school 'til I met somebody.
- Met somebody?
- Yeah, two big monsters!
With big green eyes.
Why, I...
Monsters?
Weren't you afraid?
No, ma'am. But they tied me in a big sack.
You don't say!
- And where was Sir Jiminy?
- Leave me outta this.
- They put him in a little sack.
- No!
- Yeah!
- How did you escape?
- I didn't.
They chopped me into firewood!
Oh, look, my nose!
What's happened?
Perhaps you haven't been telling the truth.
- Perhaps?
- But I have!
Every single word!
Please help me.
I'm awful sorry.
You see, Pinocchio, a lie keeps growing and growing until it's as plain as the nose on your face.
She's right, Pinoke, you better come clean.
I'll never lie again, honest, I won't.
Please, your honor, I mean...
Miss Fairy. Give him another chance, for my sake.
Will ya, huh?
I'll forgive you this once.
But, remember, a boy who won't be good might just as well be made of wood.
We'll be good, won't we?
Very well, but this is the last time I can help you.
Gee, look, Jiminy! My nose!
Hey, we're free.
Come on, Pinoke.
I buy a new suit and I swing the cane
I eat the fish and I drink champagne
I got no strings on me
Toodle-ooo, Stromboli.
- Goodbye, Mr. Stromboli.
Let's get outta here before something else happens.
Hi diddle dee dee An actor's life for me
A high silk hat and a silver cane
A watch of gold with a diamond chain
Hi diddle dee day An actor's life is gay
It's great to be a celebrity
An actor's life for me
Hook, line and sinker!
And he still thinks we're his friends!
And did Stromboli pay!
Plenty!
That shows you how low Honest John will stoop.
Eh, Giddy?
Now, Coachman...
- What's your proposition?
- Well how would you blokes like to make some real money?
Well... and who do we have to...
No, no!
Nothing like that.
You see...
I'm collecting stupid little boys.
- Stupid little boys?
- You know, the disobedient ones what play hooky from school.
And you see...
Yes.
...and I takes 'em to Pleasure Island!
Pleasure Island.
But the law, suppose they...
No, no. There is no risk!
They never come back as boys!
Now I've got a coach load leaving at midnight.
We'll meet at the crossroads, and no double-crossing!
- No, sir.
- Scout around.
Any good prospects you find, bring 'em to me.
- Yes, chief.
- I'll pay you well.
- I got plenty of gold.
- Yes, yes. - I got plenty of gold. - Yes, yes.
No, sir, nothing can stop me now.
I'll make good this time.
- You'd better!
- I will. I'm going to school.
That's the stuff, Pinoke.
I'd rather be smart than be an actor.
Now you're talkin'!
Come on, slowpoke. I'll race ya home.
Well, well, Pinocchio, what's your rush?
I gotta beat Jiminy home.
Oh, hello. - Well, how is the great actor?
- I don't want to be an actor.
- Stromboli was terrible!
- He was?
Yeah, he locked me in a bird cage.
- He did?
- But I learned my lesson.
- I'm going...
- You poor, poor boy.
You must be a nervous wreck.
That's it!
You are a nervous wreck.
We must diagnose this case at once.
Quick, doctor, your notebook.
Bless my soul.
My, my.
Just as I thought.
A slight touch of monetary complications with bucolic semi-lunar contraptions of the flying trapezes.
Say hippopotamus.
- Hi-ho-hotamus.
- I knew it!
Compound transmission of the pandemonium with percussion and spasmodic frantic disintegration!
- Close your eyes. What do you see?
- Nothing. - Open them.
Now what do you see?
- Spots!
Now that heart.
My goodness!
A palpitating syncopation of the killer diller with a wicky wacky stomping of the floy joy!
Quick, doctor, that report.
This makes it perfectly clear.
My boy, you are allergic.
- Allergic? - Yes!
And there is only one cure.
- A vacation on Pleasure Island.
- Pleasure Island?
Yes! That happy land of carefree boys where every day is a holiday!
- But I can't go.
- Why, of course you can go.
I'm giving you my ticket.
- Here.
- Thanks!
But I'm...
I insist.
Your health comes first.
Come, the coach departs at midnight!
Hi diddle dee dee It's Pleasure Isle for me
Where every day is a holiday
And kids have nothing to do but play
Oh, Pinoke? Now where do you suppose he...
Pinocchio!
Hey, come back.
Well here we go again.
My name's Lampwick.
What's yours?
- Ever been to Pleasure Island?
But Mr. Honest John gave me...
Me neither, but they say it's a swell joint.
No school, no cops.
You can tear the joint apart and nobody says a word.
Honest John gave me...
Loaf around, plenty to eat, plenty to drink.
- And it's all free!
- Honest John... Boy, that's the place. I can hardly wait!
Right here, boys!
Right here.
Get your cake, pie, dill pickles and ice cream.
Eat all you can.
Be a glutton.
Stuff yourselves. it's all free, boys.
It's all free. Hurry, hurry, hurry.
The rough house, the rough house.
It's the roughest, toughest joint ya ever seen.
- Come in and pick a fight, boys.
- Oh, boy, a scrap!
Come on. Let's go in and poke somebody in the nose.
- Why?
- Just for the fun of it.
OK, Lampy.
Tobacco Row.
Get your cigars, cigarettes and chewing' tobacco.
Come in and smoke your heads off.
There's nobody here to stop you. Pinocchio?
There's something phony about all this.
I gotta get him outta here!
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
See the model home.
It's open for destruction, and it's all yours, boys!
She's all yours.
What'd I tell ya?
Ain't this a swell joint?
Yeah!
Being bad's a lot of fun, ain't it?
Yeah.
Get a load of that strained-glass window.
All right, now.
Come on!
Come on!
Shut the doors and lock 'em tight.
Give a bad boy enough rope and he'll soon make a jackass of himself.
Where is everybody?
The place is like a graveyard.
I don't like the looks of this.
Hey, where are you?
Where do you suppose all the kids went to?
They're around here somewheres. What do you care?
- You're havin' a good time, ain't ya?
Oh, boy! This is the life, Pinoke.
Yeah!
It sure is!
You smoke like me grandmother!
Come on, take a big drag, like this.
OK, Lampy.
Some fun, huh, kid?
OK, Slats, your shot.
What's the matter, Slats?
Losing your grip?
So this is where I find you!
How do you ever expect to be a real boy?
Look at yourself...
smoking, playing pool!
You're comin' right home with me this minute!
Hey, who's the beetle?
Let go!
- Let me out. - He's my conscience!
- He tells me what's right and wrong.
- What?
You mean to tell me you take orders from a grasshopper?
Grasshopper?
Look here, you impudent young pup!
It wouldn't hurt you to take orders from your grasshop your conscience, if you have one.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Screwball in the corner pocket.
Why, why... ya young hoodlum!
I'll knock your block off!
I'll take you apart and put you back together!
Don't hurt him. He's my best friend.
Why, I'll...
Your best friend?
And what am I?
Just your conscience!
OK, that settles it!
But, Jiminy...
You buttered your bread, now sleep in it!
Go on, laugh.
Make a jackass outta yourself.
I'm through! - This is the end.
- But Jiminy...
- Lampwick says a guy only lives once.
Come on, come on.
Let him go.
It burns me up.
After all I tried to do for him.
Who's his conscience, anyway?
Me or that hoodlum, Lampwick?
I've had enough of this.
I'm taking the next boat out of here.
Open up that door!
Open up!
I wanna go home.
Come on, you blokes, keep 'em moving!
Lively there now. We haven't got all night.
Where'd all the donkeys come from?
Come on, come on.
Let's have another.
And what's your name?
OK, you'll do!
In you go!
You boys'll bring a nice price.
All right, next!
And what might your name be?
- Alexander.
- So you can talk!
Yes, sir.
I wanna go home to my mama!
Take him back!
He can still talk!
Please, please!
I don't wanna be a donkey. - Let me outta here!
- Quiet!
You boys have had your fun. Now pay for it!
Boys?
So that's what...
To hear that beetle talk... you'd think somethin' was gonna happen to us.
Conscience! Phooey!
Where's he get that stuff?
How do you ever expect to be a real boy?
What's he think I look like?
- A jackass?
- You sure do!
Hey, you laugh like a donkey.
Did that come outta me?
What the...
What's going on?
I've been double-crossed!
Help!
Help! Somebody, help!
I've been framed!
Help!
Please, you gotta help me.
Be a pal.
Call that beetle.
Call anybody.
Mama?
Mama!
- What's happened?
- I hope I'm not too late.
What'll I do?
- Jiminy!
Oh, Jiminy, help!
Pinoke, the kids, the boys, they're all donkeys!
You too.
Come on, quick!
Before you get any worse.
This way, Pinoke. It's the only way out.
Hurry up before they see us.
You gotta jump!
Jiminy, you all right?
Sure!
I thought we'd never make it.
Certainly feels good to be back on dry land.
Come on, let's get home.
- Father, Father, I'm home!
- We're home, Mr. Geppetto.
Home again.
It's me, Pinocchio!
I'm home to stay.
Here he is, Mr. Geppetto.
Home at last.
Hey, maybe he's asleep.
Father?
Father, it's me.
Pinoke, come here.
Look.
He ain't here.
- He... He's gone.
- Yeah, and Figaro.
And Cleo too.
Maybe something awful happened to him.
Don't worry, son, he probably hasn't gone far.
It's a message.
- What's it say?
- It's about your father.
- Where is he?
- Why, it says here he went looking for you and he was swallowed by a whale.
- Swallowed by a whale?
- Yeah. A whale?
A whale named Monstro.
- But wait, he's alive.
- Alive?
Where?
Why, inside the whale at the bottom of the sea.
Bottom of the sea?
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm going to find him.
Pinoke, are you crazy?
- Don't you realize he's in a whale?
- I've gotta go to him.
Hey, Pinoke, wait!
Listen here, son...
But this Monstro, I've heard of him.
He's a whale of a whale!
He swallows whole ships alive!
Tie it good and tight now.
And, besides, it's dangerous.
- Bye, Jiminy.
- Goodbye?
I may be live bait down there, but I'm with ya.
Come on... let's go.
Look out below!
Gangway, down there.
What a big place.
Come on, Jiminy.
All right. Soon as I take on some ballast.
One side, sister.
Well... so long.
Put it in the wrong end.
No more privacy than a goldfish.
Chilly.
Father?
Father?
Hey, Pinoke, wait for me!
Father?
Father!
He ain't my father.
Mr. Geppetto!
Hey! What the...
Hey, let go!
Run along, you little... squirt.
What's the matter? Can't a fellow...
I was only...
We were only looking for Monstro.
That got 'em.
Father?
Father?
Hello.
Can you tell me where we can find Monstro, the whale?
Gee! They're scared.
Pardon me, pearl, are you acquainted with Monstro, the whale?
Hold it there.
Father?
One side there, son.
Come on, boys, break it up.
Break it up now.
Hey!
Whoa, quit shoving'.
Don't crowd.
Take it easy there.
Steady there, Nellie.
Go ahead, Pinoke, ask them.
Could any of you tell me where to find Monstro?
Sakes alive.
Father?
- Father?
- Mr. Geppetto?
Not a bite for days.
We can't hold out much longer.
I never thought...
it would end this way, Figaro.
Starving to death in the belly of a whale.
My poor little Pinocchio.
He was such a good boy.
It's hopeless, Figaro.
There isn't a fish left.
If the monster doesn't wake up soon,
I'm afraid we... we are done for.
Here they come!
Tuna!
Oh, tuna fish!
Food!
We'll eat!
Here's a big one.
Keep them in there, Figaro.
Wait!
Wait a minute!
Have you seen...
We gotta get outta here.
Come on, Pinoke. Don't wait for me!
Never saw so many!
Here's another one.
Enough for weeks!
Here's a big one.
Keep them in there, Figaro!
Hey, blubber mouth, open up.
I gotta get in there.
Looks like the last of them.
Here's a big one. Only a few left.
We gotta work fast.
- Hey!
- Here's another one.
Hey, Father!
- Father!
- Don't bother me now, Pinocchio.
- Father!
- Pinocchio, my son!
Hey, Father, here I am.
Oh, yes!
Pinocchio, my boy!
- I'm so happy to see you.
- Me too, Father.
- You're here too.
- Yes! We're all together again.
- You are soaking wet.
- Yes, Father.
- You mustn't catch cold.
- But I came to save you.
You know, you shouldn't have come down here.
- But, Father.
- But I'm awfully glad to see you.
Let me take your hat.
- What's the matter?
- Those ears!
Ears?
Oh, these!
That's nothing.
I got a tail, too!
- What's happened to you?
- Well, I...
I...
- I...
- Never mind now.
Old Geppetto has his little woodenhead.
Nothing else matters!
I gotta get in! My pal's in there.
Come on, ya big moose!
Open up, I tell ya!
Hey!
Cut it out.
Hey, beat it, you buzzards!
Get out?
Oh, no, no, son.
I have tried every way.
Why, I even built a raft.
A raft?
That's it!
We'll take the raft and when the whale opens his mouth...
No, no, no, no. Now, listen, son.
He only opens his mouth when he's eating.
Then everything comes in, nothing goes out.
It's hopeless, Pinocchio.
Come, we make a nice fire and we cook some of the fish.
- A fire!
That's it! - Yes!
And then we'll all eat again.
- A great big fire!
Lots of smoke.
- Smoke?
Yes, sure.
- A smoked fish will taste good.
- Quick, some wood.
Pinocchio, not the chair.
- Hurry, Father, more wood!
- What'll we sit on?
We won't need it.
Getting out?
But how?
- We'll make him sneeze!
- Make him sneeze?
That will make him mad!
Well, it's about time!
- It won't work.
- Hurry, Father.
Climb aboard.
- We'll never get by those teeth!
Hey, which way are you going?
Wait for me!
Hang on.
Here we go!
Gesundheit.
- We're going back!
- No, we'll make it.
Faster, faster!
It's no use. We're done for!
We made it!
Look!
Now he is mad!
I told you he'd be furious!
- He's gone.
- Where'd he go?
Look out!
Hang on!
He's coming back.
Hurry! He's trying to kill us!
Paddle, son!
Let's go back!
Look out!
Jump!
Father?
Father?
Oh, Father!
Pinocchio, swim for shore. Swim for shore.
Hang on, Father.
Save... yourself.
Pinocchio... save yourself.
Don't mind me, son.
Save yourself...
Pinocchio.
My boy!
My brave little boy.
Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish and someday you will be a real boy.
Awake, Pinocchio.
Awake.
Father, whatcha cryin' for?
Because... you're dead, Pinocchio.
No!
No, I'm not!
Yes, yes you are.
Now lie down.
But, Father, I'm alive.
And I'm...
I'm...
I'm real!
I'm a real boy!
You're alive and...
and you are a real boy!
A real live boy.
This calls for a celebration!
Professor, lots of music!
Well!
This is practically where I came in.
Thank you, milady.
He deserved to be a real boy.
It sure was nice of you to...
Well, I'll be!
My, my!
Solid gold too.
I think it's swell!
When your heart is in your dream
No request Is too extreme
When you wish Upon a star
Your dreams
Come true
You'll find your dreams come true
Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderley again.
It seemed to me I stood by the iron gate leading to the drive, and for a while, I could not enter, for the way was barred to me.
Then, like all dreamers,
I was possessed of a sudden with supernatural powers and passed like a spirit through the barrier before me.
The drive wound away in front of me, twisting and turning as it had always done.
But as I advanced, I was aware that a change had come upon it.
Nature had come into her own again, and little by little had encroached upon the drive with long, tenacious fingers.
On and on wound the poor thread that had once been our drive, and finally, there was Manderley.
Manderley, secretive and silent.
Time could not mar the perfect symmetry of those walls.
Moonlight can play odd tricks upon the fancy, and suddenly it seemed to me that light came from the windows.
And then a cloud came upon the moon and hovered an instant like a dark hand before a face.
The illusion went with it.
I looked upon a desolate shell with no whisper of the past about its staring walls.
We can never go back to Manderley again.
That much is certain.
But sometimes in my dreams, I do go back to the strange days of my life which began for me in the South of France.
No! Stop!
What the devil are you shouting about?
Who are you? What are you staring at?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare, but I... I only thought...
Oh, you did, did you? Well, what are you doing here?
I was only walking.
Well, get on with your walking. Don't hang about here screaming.
I'll never come to Monte Carlo out of season again.
Not a single well-known personality in the hotel.
Stone cold. Waiter! Garcon!
Call him. Tell him to get me some...
Why, it's Max de Winter.
How do you do?
I'm Edythe Van Hopper.
It's so nice to run into you here, just when I was beginning to despair of finding any old friends here in Monte.
But do sit down and have some coffee.
Mr. De Winter is having some coffee with me.
Go and ask that stupid waiter for another cup.
I'm afraid I must contradict you.
You shall both have coffee with me.
Garcon. Coffee, please.
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
You know, I recognized you as soon as you came in, though I haven't seen you since that night at the casino at Palm Beach.
Perhaps you don't remember an old woman like me.
Are you playing the tables much here at Monte?
No. I'm afraid that sort of thing ceased to amuse me years ago.
I can well understand that.
As for me, if I had a home like Manderley,
I should certainly never come to Monte.
I hear it's one of the biggest places in that part of the country, and you just can't beat it for beauty.
What do you think of Monte Carlo? Or don't you think of it at all?
Well, I think it's rather artificial.
She's spoiled, Mr. De Winter, that's her trouble.
Most girls will give their eyes for a chance to see Monte.
Wouldn't that rather defeat the purpose?
Now that we've found each other again, I hope I shall see something of you.
You must come and have a drink in my suite.
I hope they've given you a good room.
The place is empty, so if you're uncomfortable, mind you make a fuss.
Your valet has unpacked for you, I suppose?
I'm afraid I don't possess one. Perhaps you would like to do it for me?
Well, I... I hardly think...
Perhaps you could make yourself useful to Mr. De Winter if he wants anything done.
You're a capable child in many ways.
That's a charming suggestion, but I'm afraid I cling to the old motto,
"He travels fastest who travels alone. " Perhaps you've not heard it.
What do you make of that?
Do you suppose that sudden departure was intended to be funny?
Come, don't sit there gawking, let's go upstairs.
- Have you got the key?
- Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.
I remember, when I was younger, there was a well-known writer who used to dart down the back way whenever he saw me coming.
I suppose he was in love with me and wasn't quite sure of himself.
Well, c'est la vie.
By the way, my dear, don't think that I mean to be unkind, but you were just a teeny-weeny bit forward with Mr. De Winter.
Your effort to enter the conversation quite embarrassed me, and I'm sure it did him.
Men loathe that sort of thing. Oh, come, don't sulk.
After all, I am responsible for your behavior here.
Perhaps he didn't notice it.
Poor thing, I suppose he just can't get over his wife's death.
They say he simply adored her.
Oh... How awkward of me.
What a stupid thing to do. Oh, I'm so sorry.
Please don't bother. It doesn't really matter.
No, leave that, leave that. Go and lay another place at my table. - Mademoiselle will have lunch with me.
- Oh, but I couldn't possibly.
- Why not?
- Oh, well, please don't be polite.
I... It's very kind of you but I'll be all right if they just change the cloth.
I wasn't being polite.
I should have asked you to have lunch with me even if you hadn't upset the vase so clumsily.
Come along.
We needn't talk to each other if we don't feel like it. Well, thank you very much.
Oh, I... I'll just have some scrambled eggs.
Oui, mademoiselle.
- What's happened to your friend?
- She's ill in bed with a cold.
I'm sorry I was so rude to you yesterday.
The only excuse I can offer is that I've become boorish through living alone.
You weren't really. You simply wanted to be alone and...
Tell me, is Mrs. Van Hopper a friend of yours or just a relation?
No, she's my employer. I'm what is known as "a paid companion. "
I didn't know companionship could be bought.
I looked at the word "companion" in the dictionary once.
It said, "a friend of the bosom. "
I don't envy you the privilege.
Well, she's very kind, really, and I have to earn my living.
Haven't you any family?
No.
My mother died years and years ago, and there was only my father, and he died last summer.
And then I took this job.
How rotten for you.
Yes, it was rather, because, you see, we got on so well together.
You and your father? Yes.
He was a lovely person, very unusual.
- What was he?
- A painter. Ah!
Was he a good one?
Well, I thought so, but people didn't understand him.
Yes, that's often the trouble.
He painted trees. At least, it was one tree.
You mean, he painted the same tree over and over again? Yes.
You see, he had a theory that if you should find one perfect thing or place or person, you should stick to it.
Do you think that's really silly? Not at all.
I'm a firm believer in that myself.
And what did you find to do with yourself while he was painting his tree?
Well, I sat with him and I sketched a little. I don't do it very well, though.
Were you going sketching this afternoon?
Yes.
- Where?
- Well, I haven't made up my mind.
I'll drive you somewhere in the car.
Oh, no, please, I didn't mean...
Oh, nonsense. Finish up that mess, and we'll get along. Thank you.
It's very kind of you, but I'm not very hungry. Come on.
Eat it up like a good girl.
You've taken long enough for that sketch.
I shall expect a really fine work of art.
Oh, no, don't look at it. It's not nearly good enough.
Well, it can't be as bad as all that. Now don't rub it all out.
Let me see it first. Well, it's the perspective.
I never can get it right. Let me see it, let me see it.
Oh, dear.
Tell me, is it the perspective that gives my nose that curious twist in the middle?
Well, you're not a very easy subject to sketch.
Your...
Your expression keeps changing all the time. Does it?
Well, I'd...
I'd concentrate on the view instead, if I were you.
Much more worthwhile.
It rather reminds me of our coastline at home.
Do you know Cornwall at all?
Yes, I went there once with my father on holiday.
I was in a shop once, and I saw a postcard with a beautiful house on it, right by the sea.
I asked whose house it was, and the old lady said, "That's Manderley. "
I felt ashamed for not knowing.
Manderley is beautiful.
But to me, it's just the place where I was born, and have lived in all my life.
But now, I don't suppose I shall ever see it again.
We're lucky not to be home during the bad weather, aren't we?
I can't ever remember enjoying swimming in England till June, can you?
The water's so warm here that I could stay in all day.
There's a dangerous undertow and there was a man drowned here last year.
I never have any fear of drowning. Have you?
Come, I'll take you home.
Oh, yes, I know Mr. De Winter well. I knew his wife, too.
Before she married, she was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
She was drowned, poor dear, while she was sailing near Manderley.
He never talks about it, of course, but he's a broken man.
I suppose I'd better have it. Wretched stuff!
Give me a chocolate, quick! Oh, there you are.
It's about time.
Hurry up. I want to play some rummy.
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
They say he simply adored her.
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
I suppose he just can't get over his wife's death.
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
But he's a broken man.
Bonjour.
- Well, where are you going?
- I thought I'd take a tennis lesson. I see.
I suppose you've had a look at the pro, and he's desperately handsome, and you've conceived a schoolgirl crush on him.
All right. Go ahead. Make the most of it.
Off duty?
Well, yes.
Mrs. Van Hopper's cold's turned into flu, so she's got a trained nurse.
I'm sorry for the nurse. You keen on tennis?
- Well, not particularly.
- That's good. We'll go for a drive.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Van Hopper. How are you feeling?
You got on rather well with him, didn't you?
That pro must have been teaching you other things than tennis.
Hurry up, I want you to make some calls.
I wonder if Mr. De Winter is still in the hotel.
May I go now?
For the number of lessons you've had, you ought to be ready for Wimbledon.
But this will be your last, so make the most of it.
The trouble is, with me laid up like this, you haven't had enough to do.
I'm getting rid of that nurse today.
And from now on, you'll stick to your job.
Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.
- Nurse?
- Yes, Mrs. Hopper?
Are you absolutely sure you left those messages for Mr. De Winter?
- Why, yes, madame.
- I simply can't believe it.
He would most certainly have called me back. Oh, well.
Poor boy, I simply hate to see him so alone.
You know, I...
I wish there could be an invention that bottled up the memory, like perfume, and it never faded, never got stale.
Then whenever I wanted to, I could uncork the bottle and live the memory all over again.
And what particular moment in your young life would you want to keep?
All of them. All these last few days.
I feel as though I'd... I'd collected a whole shelf full of bottles.
Sometimes, you know, those little bottles contain demons that have a way of popping out at you, just as you're trying most desperately to forget.
Stop biting your nails.
I wish I were a woman of 36, dressed in black satin with a string of pearls.
You wouldn't be here with me if you were.
Would you please tell me, Mr. De Winter, why you asked me to come out with you?
It's obvious you want to be kind, but why do you choose me for your charity?
I asked you to come out with me because I wanted your company.
You've blotted out the past for me more than all the bright lights of Monte Carlo.
But if you think I just asked you out of kindness or charity, you can leave the car now and find your own way home.
Go on. Open the door and get out.
- Better blow your nose. - Thank you.
Please don't call me Mr. De Winter.
I have a very impressive array of first names.
George Fortescue Maximilian.
You needn't bother with them all at once.
And another thing, please promise me never to wear black satin or pearls, or to be 36 years old.
Yes, Maxim.
For the love of Pete! Come here!
What do you think? My daughter's engaged to be married. Oh, really?
How nice!
We must leave for New York at once.
Get reservations on the Aquitania, and we'll take the 12:30 train for Cherbourg.
Hurry up and get me the maid to help with the packing.
We've no time to waste. Go on and don't dawdle.
Mr. De Winter, please.
He's gone out riding?
He won't be back till noon?
Give me the porter, please.
I'll go and see if there's anything left in my room.
Has Mr. De Winter come in yet?
Oh, he has?
Would you connect me, please?
I was looking for my book. I suppose I've packed it.
Well, come on, the car's waiting at the door.
I'd like to leave a forwarding address, if they happen to find that book.
- Would you ring Mr. De Winter, please?
- Yes, madame.
- There isn't any answer.
- Thank you. - Tell her to hurry up!
- Yes, madame.
I was looking for Mr. De Winter.
Mr. De Winter just ordered breakfast in his room, mademoiselle.
Come in.
Hello. What are you doing here? Anything the matter?
I've come to say goodbye. We're going away.
What on Earth are you talking about?
It's true.
We're going now, and I was afraid I wouldn't see you again.
- Where's she taking you to?
- New York. I don't want to go.
I shall hate it. I shall be miserable.
I'll dress in here. I shan't be long.
Which would you prefer, New York or Manderley?
Oh, please don't joke about it. Mrs. Van Hopper's waiting.
I'd better say goodbye now.
I'll repeat what I said.
Either you go to America with Mrs. Van Hopper, or you come home to Manderley with me.
You mean you want a secretary or something?
I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool.
Come in.
Is that my food? I'm famished. I didn't have any breakfast.
My suggestion didn't seem to go at all well. Sorry.
Oh, but you don't understand. It's the...
- I'm not the sort of person men marry.
- What on Earth do you mean?
I don't belong in your sort of world, for one thing.
Well, what is my sort of world?
Well, Manderley. You know what I mean.
Well, I'm the best judge of whether you belong there or not.
Of course, if you don't love me, that's a different thing.
Fine blow to my conceit, that's all.
I do love you. I love you most dreadfully.
I've been crying all morning because I thought I'd never see you again.
Bless you for that.
I'll remind you of this one day and you won't believe me.
It's a pity you have to grow up.
Well, now that's settled.
You may pour me out some coffee. Two lumps of sugar and some milk, please.
Same with my tea, don't forget.
Who is going to break the news to Mrs. Van Hopper?
Shall you or should I? You tell her.
She'll be so angry. What's the number of her room?
She's not there. She's downstairs in the car.
Hello. Give me the desk, please.
Hello. You'll find Mrs. Van Hopper waiting outside in her car.
Would you ask her, with my compliments, if she'd very kindly come up and see me in my room?
Yes, in my room.
Mr. De Winter says please for you to come up to his room.
Mr. De Winter?
Why, certainly.
This isn't at all your idea of a proposal, is it?
It should be in a conservatory, you in a white frock, with a red rose in your hand, and a violin playing in the distance, and I should be making violent love to you behind a palm tree.
Poor darling. Never mind.
I don't mind.
Don't worry. Don't worry. You won't have to say a word.
I'm so glad you called me, Mr. De Winter.
I was making a hasty departure. It was so rude of me not to let you know.
But a cable came this morning announcing that my daughter is engaged to be married.
That's rather a coincidence, Mrs. Van Hopper.
I asked you up here in order to tell you of my engagement.
You don't mean it. How perfectly wonderful.
How romantic. Who is the lucky lady?
I apologize for depriving you of your companion in this abrupt way.
I do hope it won't inconvenience you too greatly.
When did all this happen?
Just now, Mrs. Van Hopper. Just a few minutes ago.
I simply can't believe it.
And I suppose I ought to scold you for not having breathed a word of all of this to me.
What am I thinking of? I should give you both my congratulations and my blessings.
I'm very happy for you both. - When and where is the wedding to be?
- Here, as soon as possible.
A whirlwind romance.
Splendid! I can easily postpone my sailing for a week.
This poor child has no mother, so I shall take responsibility for all the arrangements.
Trousseau, reception and everything, and I'll give the bride away.
But our luggage. Go down and tell the porter to take everything out of the car.
Just a minute.
We're most grateful, Mrs. Van Hopper, but I think we'd both prefer to have it all as quiet as possible.
And I couldn't possibly allow you to change your sailing plans.
- Oh, but...
- No, no, no. Dear, I'll go down and see that your luggage is brought back.
Thank you, Maxim.
So this is what's been happening during my illness.
Tennis lessons, my foot.
I suppose I've to hand it to you for a fast worker.
How did you manage it? Still waters certainly run deep.
Tell me, have you been doing anything you shouldn't?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Well, never mind.
I always did say that Englishmen have strange tastes.
You certainly have your work cut out as mistress of Manderley.
To be perfectly frank with you, my dear, I can't see you doing it.
You haven't the experience, you haven't the faintest idea what it means to be a great lady.
Of course you know why he's marrying you, don't you?
You haven't flattered yourself that he's in love with you?
Fact is, that empty house got on his nerves to such an extent, he nearly went off his head.
He just couldn't go on living alone.
You'd better leave, Mrs. Van Hopper. You'll miss your train.
Mrs. De Winter.
Goodbye, my dear, and good luck!
Monsieur! What is he saying?
He says I've forgotten the proof that we're married.
Good heavens.
Somebody else had the same idea.
- Isn't she sweet?
- Yes.
You'd have liked a bridal veil, wouldn't you?
Or at least...
Oh, Maxim, how lovely.
How perfectly lovely.
Perfectly lovely.
Welcome home, Mr. De Winter.
Thank you, Smith.
- Cold, darling?
- Yes, just a little bit.
There's no need to be frightened, you know.
Just be yourself, and they'll all adore you.
You don't have to worry about the house at all.
Mrs. Danvers is the housekeeper. Just leave it to her.
Hello. It's starting to rain. We'd better hurry up.
Here. Have this. Put it over your head.
Thank you.
That's it. That's Manderley.
- Here we are. Frith, everybody well?
- Yes, thank you, sir. Glad to see you home, sir.
- This is Mrs. De Winter, Frith.
- How do you do?
I didn't expect the whole staff to be in attendance.
Mrs. Danvers' orders, sir.
Oh. Sorry about this. It won't take long.
This is Mrs. Danvers.
How do you do?
I have everything in readiness for you.
That's very good of you. I... I didn't expect anything.
- I think we'd like some tea, Frith.
- Ready in the library, sir. Come along, darling.
Oh, Maxim, come in.
Oh. - Good evening, Mrs. Danvers.
- Good evening, madam.
- I hope Alice was satisfactory, madam.
- Oh, yes, thank you, perfectly.
She's the parlor maid.
She'll have to look after you until your own maid arrives.
Oh, but I haven't a maid. I'm sure Alice will do very nicely.
I'm afraid that would not do for very long, madam.
It's usual for ladies in your position to have a personal maid.
I hope you approve the new decoration of these rooms, madam?
Oh, I didn't know it had been changed.
I hope you haven't been to too much trouble.
I only followed out Mr. De Winter's instructions.
Well, what did it look like before?
It had an old paper and different hangings.
It was never used much except for occasional visitors. Oh.
Then it wasn't Mr. De Winter's room originally? No, madam.
He's never used the east wing before.
Of course, there's no view of the sea from here.
The only good view of the sea is from the west wing.
The room's very charming, and I'm sure I'll be comfortable.
If there's anything you want done, madam, you have only to tell me.
I suppose you've been at Manderley for many years, longer than anyone else.
Not so long as Frith.
He was here when the old gentleman was living, when Mr. De Winter was a boy.
Oh, I see. And you didn't come till after that?
I came here when the first Mrs. De Winter was a bride.
Mrs. Danvers, I do hope we'll be friends.
You must be patient with me.
This sort of life is new to me and I do want to make a success of it, and make Mr. De Winter happy, so I know I can leave all the household arrangements to you.
Very well. I hope I shall do everything to your satisfaction, madam.
I've managed the house since Mrs. De Winter's death and Mr. De Winter has never complained.
I think I'll go downstairs now.
That room in the west wing I was telling you about is there, through that door.
It's not used now.
It's the most beautiful room in the house, the only one that looks down across the lawns to the sea.
It was Mrs. De Winter's room.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- You're Mrs. De Winter, aren't you?
- Yes.
My name's Crawley.
I manage the estate for Maxim.
Awfully glad to meet you.
A fearful lot of stuff piled up while Maxim was away.
Yes, I'm sure there must have been.
I do wish I could help with some of it. No, no!
Frank never allows anybody to help him.
He's like an old mother hen with his bills and rents and taxes.
Come on, Frank, we must go over these estimates.
I'll get my papers.
You'll find quantities of breakfast over there.
But you must eat it all, or Cook will be mortally offended.
I'll do my best, Maxim.
I have to go over the place with Frank, just to make sure that he hasn't lost any of it.
You'll be all right, won't you?
Getting acquainted with your new home?
Have a look at The Times. There's a thrilling article on what's the matter with English cricket.
Oh, yes...
My sister, Beatrice, and her husband, Giles Lacy, have invited themselves over for lunch.
- Today? - Yes.
I suppose the old girl can't wait to look you over.
You'll find her very direct.
If she doesn't like you, she'll probably tell you so to your face.
Don't worry, darling, I'll be back in time to protect you from her.
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Maxim.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning, Frith.
Isn't there anything I could get for you, madam?
No, thank you, Frith. I'm really not very hungry.
Thank you.
- The paper, madam.
- Oh, yes. Thank you, Frith.
I slipped.
Thank you, Frith.
- It's big, isn't it?
- Yes, madam, Manderley is a big place.
This was the banquet hall in the old days.
It's still used on great occasions, such as a big dinner or a ball.
And the public is admitted here, you know, once a week.
That's nice.
I beg pardon, madam.
I'm afraid the fire is not usually lit in the library until the afternoon.
But you'll find one in the morning room.
Of course, if you wish this fire lit now, madam...
No, Frith, I wouldn't dream of it.
Mrs. De Winter...
I mean, the late Mrs. De Winter always did her correspondence and telephoning in the morning room, after breakfast.
Thank you, Frith.
Is anything wrong, madam?
Oh, no. Which way is the morning room?
Oh, it's that door there, on the left.
Oh, yes, thank you.
Mrs. De Winter?
Oh, I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
Mrs. De Winter's been dead for over a year.
Oh, I mean...
Oh. That was the house telephone, madam.
Probably the head gardener wishing instructions.
Did you want to see me, Mrs. Danvers?
Mr. De Winter informed me that his sister, Mrs. Lacy, and Major Lacy are expected for luncheon.
I'd like to know if you approve of the menu.
Oh, well, I'm sure it's very suitable, very nice indeed.
You will notice, madam, that I've left a blank space for the sauce.
Mrs. De Winter was most particular about sauces.
Let's have whatever you think that Mrs. De Winter would have ordered.
Thank you, madam.
When you've finished your letters, Robert will take them to the post.
My... My letters?
Oh, yes, of course. Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.
How are you, Frith?
- Good morning, Mrs. Lacy.
Where's Mr. De Winter?
I believe he went down to the farm with Mr. Crawley.
How tiresome of him not to be here when we arrive, and how typical.
I must say old Danvers keeps the house looking lovely.
She's certainly learned that trick of arranging flowers from Rebecca.
I wonder how she likes it now, being ordered about by an ex-chorus girl.
Now, where on Earth did you get the idea she's an ex-chorus girl?
He picked her up in the South of France, didn't he?
What if he did?
Well, I mean to say, there you are.
How do you do? I'm Maxim's wife.
How do you do?
Well, I must say you're quite different from what I expected.
Don't be so silly. She's exactly what I told you she'd be.
Well, how do you like Manderley?
It's very beautiful, isn't it?
And how do you get along with Mrs. Danvers?
Well, I... I've never met anyone quite like her before.
You mean, she scares you.
She's not exactly an oil painting, is she?
Giles, you're very much in the way here. Go somewhere else.
Well, I'll try and find Maxim, shall I?
Giles.
I didn't mean to say anything against Mrs. Danvers.
Oh, there's no need for you to be frightened of her, but I shouldn't have any more to do with her than you can help.
- Shall we sit down? - Yes.
Yes, please.
You see, she's bound to be insanely jealous at first and she must resent you bitterly.
But why should she?
Don't you know? I should have thought Maxim would have told you.
She simply adored Rebecca.
- How are you, Robert?
- Quite well, thank you, madam.
- Still having trouble with your teeth?
- Unfortunately, yes, madam.
You must have them out, all of them. - Wretched nuisances, teeth.
- Thank you, madam.
What a plateful.
Do you hunt?
No, I don't. I'm afraid I don't even ride.
You have to ride down here, we all do.
Which do you ride, sidesaddle or astride?
Well, of course, I forgot. You don't, do you?
You must.
Nothing else to do around here. Maxim, when are you going to have parties here again, like the old days?
I haven't thought about it.
- But everyone's dying to see you and...
- Yes, I bet they are.
Why don't you have the masquerade ball again this summer?
My dear, are you fond of dancing?
I love it, but I'm not very good at it.
Do you rumba?
- Never tried.
- You must teach me.
Actually, I'm trying to find out exactly what your wife does do.
She sketches a little.
Sketches.
Not this modern stuff, I hope, you know, portrait of a lampshade upside down to represent a soul in torment.
Don't sail, do you?
No, I don't.
Thank goodness for that. Huh?
You're very much in love with Maxim, aren't you?
Yes, I can see you are.
Don't mind my saying so, but why don't you do something about your hair?
Why don't you have it cut or sweep it back behind your ears?
Oh, no, that's worse. What does Maxim say about it?
Does he like it like that?
Well, he never mentions it.
Oh, well, don't go by me.
I can see by the way you dress you don't care a hoot how you look.
But I wonder Maxim hasn't been at you.
He's so particular about clothes.
I don't think he ever notices what I wear.
Oh. He must have changed a lot, then.
You mustn't worry about old Maxim and his moods.
One never knows what goes on in that quiet mind of his.
Often, he gets into a terrible rage, and when he does...
I don't suppose he'll lose his temper with you.
You seem such a placid little thing.
Come on, old girl. We've got to go on the first tee at 3:00.
All right, I'm coming.
Well, goodbye, Maxim, old boy.
Goodbye, Giles. Thanks for coming, old boy.
Goodbye, my dear. Forgive me for asking you so many rude questions.
We both really hope you'll be very happy.
Thank you, Beatrice, thank you very much.
And I must congratulate you upon the way Maxim looks.
We were very worried about him this time last year.
But then, of course, you know the whole story.
Goodbye, Beatrice.
- Goodbye, old boy.
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.
Well, thank heavens they've gone. Now we can have a walk about the place.
Looks as though we might have a shower.
But you won't mind that, will you? No, but wait a minute.
I'll go upstairs and get a coat.
There's a heap of mackintoshes in the flower room. Robert?
Run and get a coat from the flower room for Mrs. De Winter, will you?
What do you think of Beatrice?
Oh, I liked her very much, but she kept saying that I was quite different from what she expected.
Oh, someone smarter and more sophisticated, I'm afraid.
Do you like my hair? Your hair?
Yes, of course I do.
What's the matter with it? Oh, I don't know.
I just wondered.
How funny you are. Thank you.
- Do I have to put it on?
- Yes, certainly, certainly, certainly. You can't be too careful with children. Come on, Jasper.
Come and take some of that fat off.
Jasper! Here. Not that way!
Where does that lead to?
Oh, it leads to a little cove where we used to keep a boat.
Oh, let's go down there. Well, no.
It's a perfectly dull, uninteresting stretch of sand, - just like any other.
- Oh, please.
Well, all right.
We'll walk down and take a look if you really want to.
That's Jasper. There must be something wrong. - Perhaps he's hurt himself.
- No, he's all right, leave him alone.
Don't you think I'd better go and see?
Don't bother about him, I tell you, he can't come to any harm. He'll find his own way back!
Jasper! Jasper?
Oh, there you are.
What do you want in there, Jasper? Come on. Come on home.
Jasper...
Oh. I didn't know that there was anybody...
I know that dog. He comes from the house.
He ain't yours. No.
He's Mr. De Winter's dog.
Have you anything I could tie him with?
Come on, Jasper.
You won't tell anyone you saw me in there, will you?
Don't you belong on the estate?
I weren't doing nothing. I was just putting me shells away.
She's gone in the sea, ain't she?
She'll never come back no more.
No. She'll never come back. Come on, Jasper.
Maxim! What's the matter?
Maxim!
I'm sorry I was such a time, but I had to find a rope for Jasper.
Hurry up, Jasper, for heaven's sake.
Please wait for me. Maxim, what is it? You look so angry.
You knew I didn't want you to go there, but you deliberately went.
Why not?
There was only a cottage down there and a strange man who...
- You didn't go in the cottage, did you?
- Yes, the door was...
- Don't go there again, do you hear? - Well, why not? Because I hate the place.
And if you had my memories, you wouldn't go there or talk about it or even think about it.
What's the matter? Oh, I'm sorry, please. We should have stayed away.
We should never have come back to Manderley.
Oh, what a fool I was.
I've made you unhappy. Somehow, I've hurt you.
Oh, I can't bear to see you like this because I love you so much.
Do you?
I've made you cry. Forgive me.
I sometimes seem to fly off the handle for no reason at all.
Don't I?
Come, we'll go home and have some tea and forget all about it.
Yes, let's forget all about it.
Here, let me have Jasper.
- Hello. Come in.
- Oh, please don't get up, Mr. Crawley.
I was just wondering if you meant what you said the other day
- about showing me the run of things. - Of course I did.
What are you doing now?
Notifying all the tenants that in celebration of Maxim's return with his bride, this week's rent will be free.
Oh, is that Maxim's idea? Oh, yes, all the servants get an extra week's wages, too.
Oh, he didn't tell me.
Can't I help you?
I could at least lick the stamps. Well, that's terribly nice of you.
Won't you sit down?
Yes, thank you.
I was down at the cottage on the beach the other day.
There was a man there, a queer sort of person.
Jasper kept barking at him. Oh, yes, it must have been Ben.
Excuse me.
He's quite harmless.
We give him odd jobs now and then.
That cottage bay seemed to be going to rack and ruin.
Why isn't something done about it?
I think if Maxim wanted anything done about it, he'd tell me.
Are those all Rebecca's things down there?
Yes. Yes, they are.
What did she use the cottage for?
The boat used to be moored near there. What boat?
What happened to it?
Was that the boat she was sailing in when she was drowned?
Yes. It capsized and sank. She was washed overboard.
Wasn't she afraid to go out like that alone?
She wasn't afraid of anything.
Where did they find her?
Near Edgecombe, about 40 miles up channel about two months afterwards.
Maxim went up to identify her. It was horrible for him.
Yes, it must have been.
Mr. Crawley, please don't think me morbidly curious. It isn't that.
It's... It's just that I feel at such a disadvantage.
All the time, whenever I meet anyone, Maxim's sister or even the servants,
I know they're all thinking the same thing, that they're all comparing me with her, with Rebecca.
You mustn't think that.
I can't tell you how glad I am that you married Maxim.
It's going to make all the difference to his life.
From my point of view, it's very refreshing to find someone like yourself, who's not entirely in tune, shall we say, with Manderley.
That's very sweet of you.
I daresay I've been stupid, but every day I realize the things she had that I lack.
Beauty and wit and intelligence, and all the things that are so important in a woman.
You have qualities that are just as important, more important, if I may say so.
Kindliness and sincerity, and if you'll forgive me, modesty, mean more to a husband than all the wit and beauty in the world.
We, none of us want to live in the past, Maxim least of all.
It's up to you, you know, to lead us away from it.
Right.
I promise you I won't bring this up again, but before we end this conversation, would you answer just one more question?
If it's something I'm able to answer, I'll do my best.
Tell me, what was Rebecca really like?
I suppose...
I suppose she was the most beautiful creature I ever saw.
Good evening, Maxim. Hello.
The films of the honeymoon have arrived at last.
Do we have time, do you think, before dinner?
What on Earth have you done to yourself?
Oh, nothing. I just ordered a new dress from London.
I hope you don't mind.
Oh, no, no. Only, do you think that sort of thing's right for you?
- It doesn't seem your type at all.
- I thought you'd like it.
And what have you done to your hair?
Oh, I see. Dear, oh, dear.
I'm sorry.
You look lovely, lovely.
It's very nice, for a change.
- Shall we see these pictures? - Yes.
I'd love to see them.
Look now, look at that.
Wasn't it wonderful, darling? Can't we go back there someday?
Yes, of course. Of course. Look at you.
Won't our grandchildren be delighted when they see how lovely you were? Oh, look at you.
Oh, I like that.
Look at that.
Yes, very nice.
- Remember that?
Yes.
I wish our honeymoon could have lasted forever, Maxim.
Dash it, look. Hang it.
I've threaded it up wrong as usual or something.
Yes, Frith. What is it? Excuse me, sir.
May I have a word with you? Yes.
Come in.
It's about Robert, sir.
There's been a slight unpleasantness between him and Mrs. Danvers. Oh, dear.
- Robert is very upset.
- This is trouble.
What is it?
It appears that Mrs. Danvers has accused Robert of stealing a valuable ornament from the morning room.
Robert denies the accusation most emphatically, sir.
- What was the thing, anyway?
- China cupid, sir. Oh, dear.
That's one of our treasures, isn't it?
Well, tell Mrs. Danvers to get to the bottom of it somehow.
- Tell her I'm sure it wasn't Robert.
- Very good, sir. Why do they come to me with these things?
That's your job, sweetheart.
Maxim, I wanted to tell you, but I forgot.
The fact is, I broke the china cupid.
You broke it?
Now, why on Earth didn't you say something about it when Frith was here? I don't know.
I didn't like to.
I was afraid he'd think me a fool.
He'll think you much more of a fool now.
You'll have to explain to him and Mrs. Danvers. Oh, no, Maxim. You do it.
I'll go upstairs. Don't be such a little idiot, darling.
Anybody would think you were afraid of them.
It's all a mistake, Mrs. Danvers.
Apparently, Mrs. De Winter broke the cupid herself and forgot to say anything about it.
I'm so sorry. I never thought that I'd get Robert into trouble.
Is it possible to repair the ornament, madam?
No, I'm afraid it isn't. It smashed into pieces.
What did you do with the pieces?
Well, I put them at the back of one of the drawers in the writing desk.
Well, it looks as though Mrs. De Winter was afraid you were going to put her in prison, doesn't it, Mrs. Danvers?
Well, never mind.
Do what you can to find the pieces.
See if they can be mended, and above all, tell Robert to dry his tears.
I shall apologize to Robert, of course.
Perhaps if such a thing happens again,
Mrs. De Winter will tell me personally. Yes, yes, all right.
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.
Well, I suppose that clip will hold all right. I don't know.
I'm awfully sorry, darling. It was very careless of me.
- Mrs. Danvers must be furious with me. - Hang Mrs. Danvers.
Why on Earth should you be frightened of her?
You behave more like an upstairs maid or something,
- not the mistress of the house at all.
- Yes, I know I do. But I feel so uncomfortable.
I try my best every day, but it's very difficult with people looking me up and down as if I were a prize cow.
What does it matter if they do?
You must remember that life at Manderley is the only thing that interests anybody down here.
What a slap in the eye I must have been to them, then.
I suppose that's why you married me, because you knew I was dull and gauche and inexperienced, and there'd never be any gossip about me.
Gossip?
What do you mean?
I don't know. I just said it for something to say.
Don't look at me like that.
Maxim. What's the matter? What have I said?
Wasn't a very attractive thing to say, was it? No.
It was rude, hateful.
I wonder if I did a very selfish thing in marrying you.
How do you mean?
I'm not much of a companion to you, am I?
You don't get much fun, do you?
You ought to have married a boy, someone of your own age.
Maxim, why do you say this? Of course we're companions. Are we?
I don't know.
- I'm very difficult to live with.
- No, you're not difficult. You're easy, very easy.
Our marriage is a success, isn't it, a great success?
We're happy, aren't we? Terribly happy?
If you don't think we are happy, it would be much better if you didn't pretend.
I'll go away.
Why don't you answer me?
How can I answer you when I don't know the answer myself?
If you say we're happy, let's leave it at that.
Happiness is something I know nothing about.
Oh, look.
There's the one when I left the camera running on the tripod, remember?
Pardon me, madam. Is there anything I can do for you?
I'm all right, Hilda. Thank you very much.
I'll bring the sandwiches immediately, madam.
- Hilda. - Yes, madam?
The west wing.
Nobody ever uses it anymore, do they? No, madam.
Not since the death of Mrs. De Winter.
Come along, Mr. Jack, or someone may see you.
Well, Danny, old harpy, it's been good to see you again.
I've been simply breathless to pick up all the news.
I really don't think it's wise for you to come here, Mr. Jack. Jasper, come here.
Oh, nonsense, nonsense.
It's just like coming back home. Quiet, Mr. Jack.
Yes.
We must be careful not to shock Cinderella, mustn't we? She's in the morning room.
If you leave through the garden door, she won't see you.
I must say, I feel a little like the poor relation, sneaking around through back doors.
Well, toodle-oo, Danny.
Goodbye, Mr. Jack, and please be careful.
Jasper, be quiet.
Looking for me? - I didn't make you jump, did I?
- No. Of course not. I didn't quite know who it was.
Yes. You're pleased to see me, aren't you, old boy?
I'm glad there's someone in the family to welcome me back to Manderley.
And how is dear old Max?
Very well, thank you.
I hear he went up to London, left his little bride all alone.
It's too bad.
Isn't he rather afraid that somebody might come down and carry you off?
Danny, all your precautions were in vain.
The mistress of the house was hiding behind the door.
Oh. What about presenting me to the bride?
This is Mr. Favell, madam.
How do you do?
- Won't you have some tea or something?
- Now, isn't that a charming invitation?
I've been asked to tea, Danny, and I've a good mind to accept.
Oh, well, perhaps you're right.
Pity, just when we were getting on so nicely.
We mustn't lead the young bride astray, must we, Jasper?
Goodbye. It's been fun meeting you.
Oh, and by the way, it would be very decent of you if you didn't mention this little visit to your revered husband.
He doesn't exactly approve of me.
- Very well.
- That's very sporting of you.
I wish I had a young bride of three months waiting for me at home.
I'm just a lonely old bachelor.
Fare thee well.
Oh, and I know what was wrong with that introduction.
Danny didn't tell you, did she? I am Rebecca's favorite cousin.
Toodle-oo!
Do you wish anything, madam?
I didn't expect to see you, Mrs. Danvers.
I noticed that a window wasn't closed and I came up to see
- if I could fasten it. - Why did you say that?
I closed it before I left the room.
You opened it yourself, didn't you?
You've always wanted to see this room, haven't you, madam?
Why did you never ask me to show it to you?
I was ready to show it to you every day.
It's a lovely room, isn't it?
Loveliest room you've ever seen.
Everything is kept just as Mrs. De Winter liked it.
Nothing has been altered since that last night. Come.
I'll show you her dressing room.
This is where I keep all her clothes.
You would like to see them, wouldn't you?
Feel this.
It was a Christmas present from Mr. De Winter.
He was always giving her expensive gifts, the whole year round.
I keep her underwear on this side.
They were made specially for her by the nuns in the Convent of St. Claire.
I always used to wait up for her, no matter how late.
Sometimes she and Mr. De Winter didn't come home until dawn.
While she was undressing, she'd tell me about the party she'd been to.
She knew everyone that mattered. Everyone loved her.
When she finished her bath, she'd go into the bedroom and go over to the dressing table.
Oh, you've moved her brush, haven't you?
There. That's better. Just as she always laid it down.
"Come on, Danny. Hair drill, " she would say.
And I'd stand behind her like this and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.
And then she would say, "Good night, Danny, "
I embroidered this case for her myself, and I keep it here always.
Did you ever see anything so delicate?
Look. You can see my hand through it.
You wouldn't think she'd been gone so long, would you?
Sometimes when I walk along the corridor,
I fancy I hear her just behind me.
That quick light step. I couldn't mistake it anywhere.
Not only in this room, it's in all the rooms in the house.
I can almost hear it now.
Do you think the dead come back and watch the living?
No, I don't believe it.
Sometimes I wonder if she doesn't come back here to Manderley, and watch you and Mr. De Winter together.
You look tired. Why don't you stay here a while and rest?
And listen to the sea.
So soothing.
Listen to it.
Listen.
Listen to the sea.
Tell Mrs. Danvers I wish to see her immediately.
You sent for me, madam?
Yes, Mrs. Danvers.
I want you to get rid of all these things.
- These are Mrs. De Winter's things.
- I am Mrs. De Winter now. Very well.
Just a moment, please.
Mrs. Danvers, I intend to say nothing to Mr. De Winter about Mr. Favell's visit.
In fact, I prefer to forget everything that happened this afternoon.
Maxim, Maxim, you've been gone all day.
You're choking me.
Well, well, well, what have you been doing with yourself?
- I've been thinking.
- What did you want to do that for?
Come in here and I'll tell you.
Darling, could we have a costume ball just as you used to?
Now what put that into your mind?
Has Beatrice been at you?
No, no, but I feel that we ought to do something to make people feel that Manderley is just the same as it always was.
Oh, please, darling, could we?
You don't know what it would mean, you know.
You'd have to be hostess to hundreds of people, all the county.
And a lot of young people would come up from London,
- and turn the house into a nightclub.
- Oh, yes. But I want to. Please.
I've never been to a large party, but I could learn what to do.
And I promise you, you wouldn't be ashamed of me.
All right, if you think you'd enjoy it.
You'd better get Mrs. Danvers to help you out, won't you?
No, no. I don't need Mrs. Danvers to help me.
I can do it myself.
All right, my sweet.
Thank you, darling.
Thank you. - What'll you go as?
- I never dress up.
That's the one privilege I claim as the host.
What will you be?
Alice in Wonderland, with that ribbon around your hair?
No, I won't tell you.
I'll design a costume all by myself and give you the surprise of your life.
Come in.
Robert found these sketches in the library, madam.
- Did you intend throwing them away?
- Yes, Mrs. Danvers, I did.
They were just some ideas I was sketching for my costume for the ball.
Hasn't Mr. De Winter suggested anything?
No, I want to surprise him.
I don't want him to know anything about it.
I merely thought that you might find a costume among the family portraits that would suit you.
Oh, you mean those at the top of the stairs? I'll go and look at them.
This one, for instance. Might have been designed for you.
I'm sure you could have it copied.
I've heard Mr. De Winter say that this is his favorite of all the paintings.
It's Lady Caroline de Winter, one of his ancestors.
Oh, well, that's a splendid idea, Mrs. Danvers.
I'm very grateful.
- Everything under control, Frith?
- Yes, sir, thank you. Excuse me, sir, are you supposed to be a schoolmaster?
Oh, no. This is just my old cap and gown.
It certainly makes a very nice costume, sir. And economical, too.
Yes. That was the idea.
Good evening, Robert. Not very good weather for the ball.
- No, sir.
- Very misty on the way and very chilly.
Oh, this wig's so tight they ought to send an aspirin with it.
Hello. What's the idea? Adam and Eve?
Oh, Maxim, don't be disgusting.
- Strongman.
Where's my weight thing?
- What thing?
You haven't left it in the car, have you?
There it is. - You were the first one down? - Yes.
Where's the child? Well, she's keeping her costume a terrific secret.
Wouldn't even let me into her room.
Oh, lovely.
I'll go up and give her a hand.
- I could do with a drink.
- Won't you catch a cold in that thing?
Don't be silly. Pure wool, old boy.
- Pardon me, sir. You forgot this.
- Thank you.
Here I am, dear, it's Bea. I've come to give you a hand.
Oh, please don't come in, Beatrice. I don't want anyone to see my costume.
Oh. Oh, you won't be long, will you?
Because the first people will be arriving any moment.
Now, you're sure that's where that should be?
Yes, madam, it's just right.
- Isn't it exciting?
- Indeed it is, madam.
I've always heard of the Manderley ball, and now I'm really going to see one.
I'm sure there will be no one there to touch you, madam.
Do you really think so? Now, where's my fan?
Here. - You're sure I look all right?
- You look ever so beautiful.
Well, here goes.
Good evening, Mr. De Winter.
What the devil do you think you're doing?
Rebecca.
But it's the picture. The one in the gallery.
- What is it? What have I done?
- Go and take it off. It doesn't matter what you put on. Anything will do.
What are you standing there for? Didn't you hear what I said?
Sir George and Lady Moore.
Dudley Tennant. Admiral and Lady Burbank.
I watched you go down, just as I watched her a year ago.
Even in the same dress, you couldn't compare.
You knew it.
You knew that she wore it, and yet you deliberately suggested I wear it.
Why do you hate me?
What have I done to you that you should ever hate me so?
You tried to take her place, you let him marry you.
I've seen his face, his eyes.
They're the same as those first weeks after she died.
I used to listen to him walking up and down, up and down, all night long, night after night, thinking of her, suffering torture because he'd lost her.
I don't want to know. I don't want to know!
You thought you could be Mrs. De Winter, live in her house, walk in her steps, take the things that were hers.
But she's too strong for you. You can't fight her.
No one ever got the better of her. Never. Never.
She was beaten in the end, but it wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman.
It was the sea. Oh, stop it.
Stop it. Oh, stop it.
You're overwrought, madam. I've opened a window for you.
A little air will do you good.
Why don't you go? Why don't you leave Manderley?
He doesn't need you.
He's got his memories.
He doesn't love you. He wants to be alone again with her.
You've nothing to stay for.
You've nothing to live for, really, have you?
Look down there. It's easy, isn't it?
Why don't you?
Why don't you?
Go on.
Don't be afraid.
Shipwreck. Ship on the rocks!
- A ship aground, sending up rockets!
- Shipwreck! Come on, everybody, down to the bay. Notify the coast guard.
She's aground. Maxim! Maxim!
Ship ashore. Come on!
Come on, everybody. Come on!
Come on! - Maxim! Maxim!
Oh!
Ben, have you seen Mr. De Winter anywhere?
She won't come back, will she?
You said so.
Who, Ben?
What do you mean?
The other one.
- Frank, have you seen Maxim anywhere?
- Not since about half an hour ago. I thought he'd gone up to the house.
No, he hasn't been in the house at all, and I'm afraid something might have happened to him.
Frank, what's the matter? Is anything wrong?
- There is something wrong.
- Well... The diver who went down to inspect the bottom of the ship came across the hull of another boat.
A little sailboat.
- Frank, is it... - Yes.
It's Rebecca's.
How did they recognize it?
He's a local man. Knew it instantly.
It'll be so hard on poor Maxim. Yes.
It's going to bring it all back again, and worse than before.
Why did they have to find it?
Why couldn't they have left it there in peace at the bottom of the sea?
Well, I'd better get along and arrange some breakfast for the men.
All right, Frank. I'll go and look for Maxim.
- Hello. - Maxim.
You haven't had any sleep.
- Have you forgiven me? - Forgiven you?
What have I got to forgive you for?
For last night. My stupidity about the costume.
Oh, that. I'd forgotten.
I was angry with you, wasn't I?
Maxim, can't we start all over again?
I don't ask that you should love me. I won't ask impossible things.
I'll be your friend, your companion.
I'll be happy with that.
You love me very much, don't you?
But it's too late, my darling.
We've lost our little chance of happiness.
- No, Maxim, no. - Yes.
It's all over now.
The thing's happened.
The thing I have dreaded day after day.
- Night after night.
- Maxim, what are you trying to tell me?
Rebecca has won.
Her shadow has been between us all the time, keeping us from one another.
She knew that this would happen.
What are you saying?
They sent a diver down. - He found another boat.
- Yes, I know. Frank told me. Rebecca's boat.
Oh, it's terrible for you. I'm so sorry.
The diver made another discovery.
Broke one of the ports and looked into the cabin.
There was a body in there.
She wasn't alone.
There was someone sailing with her, and you have to find out who it was, that's it, isn't it, Maxim?
You don't understand. There was no one with her.
It's Rebecca's body lying there on the cabin floor.
Oh, no.
The woman that was washed up at Edgecombe, the woman that is now buried in the family crypt,
that was not Rebecca.
That was the body of some unknown woman, unclaimed, belonging nowhere.
I identified it. But I knew it wasn't Rebecca.
It was all a lie.
I knew where Rebecca's body was, lying on that cabin floor on the bottom of the sea.
How did you know, Maxim?
Because I put it there.
Will you look into my eyes and tell me that you love me now?
You see? I was right.
It's too late.
No, it's not too late. You're not to say that.
I love you more than anything in the world.
- Oh, please, Maxim, kiss me, please.
- No. It's no use. It's too late.
Oh, we can't lose each other now.
We must be together always. No secrets, no shadows.
We may only have a few days, a few hours.
Maxim, why didn't you tell me before?
I nearly did sometimes, but you never seemed close enough.
How could we be close when I knew you were always thinking of Rebecca?
How could I even ask you to love me, when I knew you loved Rebecca still?
What are you talking about? What do you mean?
Whenever you touched me, I knew you were comparing me with Rebecca.
Whenever you looked at me or spoke to me or walked with me in the garden,
I knew you were thinking, "This I did with Rebecca, and this, and this. "
Oh, it's true, isn't it?
You thought I loved Rebecca? You thought that?
I hated her.
Oh, I was carried away by her, enchanted by her as everyone was.
And when I was married, I was told I was the luckiest man in the world.
She was so lovely, so accomplished, so amusing.
"She's got the three things that really matter in a wife, " everyone said.
"Breeding, brains and beauty. "
And I believed them. Completely.
But I never had a moment's happiness with her.
She was incapable of love or tenderness or decency.
You didn't love her. You didn't love her.
Do you remember that cliff where you first saw me in Monte Carlo?
Well, I went there with Rebecca on our honeymoon.
That's where I found out about her, four days after we were married.
She stood there laughing, her black hair blowing in the wind and told me all about herself.
Everything.
Things I'll never tell a living soul.
I wanted to kill her.
It would have been so easy. You remember the precipice?
I frightened you, didn't I? You thought I was mad.
Perhaps I was. Perhaps I am mad.
It wouldn't make for sanity, would it? Living with the devil?
"I'll make a bargain with you, " she said.
"You'd look rather foolish trying to divorce me now after four days of marriage, so I'll play the part of a devoted wife, mistress of your precious Manderley.
I'll make it the most famous showplace in England, if you like, and people will visit us and envy us, and say we're the luckiest, happiest couple in the country.
What a grand joke it'll be. What a triumph. "
I should never have accepted her dirty bargain, but I did.
I was younger then, and tremendously conscious of the family honor.
Family honor.
She knew that I'd sacrifice everything rather than stand up in a divorce court and give her away, admit that our marriage was a rotten fraud.
You despise me, don't you? As I despise myself.
You can't understand what my feelings were, can you?
Of course I can, darling. Of course I can.
Well, I kept the bargain and so did she, apparently.
Oh, she played the game brilliantly, but after a while, she began to grow careless.
She took a flat in London, and she'd stay away for days at a time.
Then she started to bring her friends down here.
I warned her, but she shrugged her shoulders. "What's it got to do with you?" She said.
She even started on Frank.
Poor, faithful Frank.
Then there was a cousin of hers, a man named Favell. Yes.
I know him. He came the day you went to London.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't like to. I thought it would remind you of Rebecca.
Remind me? As if I needed reminding.
Favell used to visit her here in this cottage.
I found out about it, and I warned her that if he came here again,
I'd shoot them both.
One night, when I found she had come back quietly from London,
I thought that Favell was with her, and I knew then that I couldn't stand this life of filth and deceit any longer.
I decided to come down here and have it out with both of them.
But she was alone.
She was expecting Favell, but he hadn't come.
She was lying on the divan, a large tray of cigarette stubs beside her.
She looked ill, queer.
Suddenly, she got up, started to walk toward me.
"When I have a child, " she said, "neither you nor anyone else could ever prove it wasn't yours.
You would like to have an heir, wouldn't you, Max, for your precious Manderley?"
Then she started to laugh.
"How funny.
How supremely, wonderfully funny.
I'll be the perfect mother, just as I've been the perfect wife.
No one will ever know.
It ought to give you the thrill of your life, Max, to watch my son grow bigger day by day and to know that when you die, Manderley will be his. "
She was face to face with me.
One hand in her pocket, the other holding a cigarette.
She was smiling.
"Well, Max? What are you going to do about it?
Aren't you going to kill me?"
I suppose I went mad for a moment.
I must have struck her.
She stood staring at me.
She looked almost triumphant.
Then she started toward me again. Smiling.
Suddenly, she stumbled and fell.
When I looked down, ages afterwards, it seemed, she was lying on the floor.
She had struck her head on a heavy piece of ship's tackle.
I remember wondering why she was still smiling.
Then I realized she was dead.
But you didn't kill her. It was an accident.
Who would believe me? I lost my head.
I just knew I had to do something. Anything.
I carried her out to the boat.
It was very dark. There was no moon.
I put her in the cabin.
When the boat seemed a safe distance from the shore, I took a spike, and drove it again and again through the planking of the hull.
I had opened up the seacocks and the water began to come in fast.
I climbed over into the dinghy and pulled away.
I saw the boat heel over and sink.
I pulled back into the cove.
It started raining.
- Maxim, does anyone else know of this? - No.
No one except you and me.
We must explain it.
It's got to be the body of someone you've never seen before.
No, they're bound to know her.
Her rings, bracelets she always wore.
They'll identify her body, then they'll remember the other woman.
The other woman buried in the crypt.
If they find out it was Rebecca, you must simply say you made a mistake about the other body.
That the day you went to Edgecombe, you were ill, you didn't know what you were doing.
Rebecca's dead. That's what we've got to remember. Rebecca's dead.
She can't speak. She can't bear witness.
She can't harm you anymore.
We're the only two people in the world that know, Maxim, you and I.
I'd told you once that I'd done a selfish thing in marrying you.
You can understand now what I meant.
I've loved you, my darling.
I shall always love you, but I've known all along that Rebecca would win in the end.
No, no. She hasn't won.
No matter what happens now, she hasn't won.
Hello?
Hello, Frank. Hello, Frank. Yes.
Who? Colonel Julyan? Yes.
Tell him I'll meet him there as soon as I possibly can.
What? Well...
Say we could talk about that when we're sure about the matter.
What's happened?
Colonel Julyan called. He's the chief constable of the county.
He's been asked by the police to go to the mortuary.
He wanted to know if I could possibly have made a mistake about that other body.
Well, Colonel Julyan, apparently I did make a mistake about that other body.
The mistake was natural under the circumstances. - Besides, you weren't well at the time.
- That's nonsense.
I was perfectly well.
Don't let it worry you, Maxim.
Nobody can blame you for making a mistake.
The pity is, you've got to go through the same thing all over again. What do you mean?
There'll have to be another inquest, of course.
Same formality and red tape.
Wish you could be spared the publicity of it, but I'm afraid that's impossible.
Oh, yes, publicity.
I suppose Mrs. De Winter went below for something and a squall hit the boat with nobody at the helm.
I imagine that's about the solution now, don't you think so, Crawley? Oh, yes.
Probably the door jammed, and she couldn't get on deck again. Yeah.
Tabb, the boat builder, will undoubtedly come to some such conclusion.
Why, what would he know about it?
Well, he's examining the boat now.
Purely as a matter of routine, you know.
I'll be at the inquest tomorrow, Maxim, quite unofficially, you know.
We must get together for a game of golf when it's all over, eh? Bye-bye.
I have the evening papers, madam. Would you care to see them?
Oh, no thank you, Frith, and I prefer that Mr. De Winter weren't troubled with them, either.
Permit me to say that we're all most distressed outside.
Thank you, Frith.
I'm afraid the news has been a great shock to Mrs. Danvers.
Yes, I rather expected it would be.
It seems there's to be a coroner's inquest, madam? Yes, Frith.
It's purely a formality.
Of course, madam. I...
I wanted to say that if any of us might be required to give evidence,
I should be only too pleased to do anything that might help the family.
Oh, thank you, Frith, why, I...
I'm sure Mr. De Winter will be very happy to hear it.
But I don't think anything will be necessary.
Maxim.
Hello, darling.
Oh, Maxim, I'm worried about what you'll do at the inquest tomorrow.
What do you mean?
You won't lose your temper, will you?
Promise me that they won't make you angry.
All right, darling. I promise.
No matter what he asks you, you won't lose your head?
Don't worry, dear.
They can't do anything at once, can they? No.
Then we've a little time left to be together. Yes.
- I want to go to the inquest with you.
- I'd rather you didn't, darling.
But I can't wait here alone.
I promise you, I won't be any trouble to you.
And I must be near you so that no matter what happens, we won't be separated for a moment.
All right, dear.
I don't mind this whole thing except for you.
I can't forget what it's done to you.
I've been thinking of nothing else since it happened.
It's gone forever, that funny, young, lost look I loved.
It won't ever come back.
I killed that when I told you about Rebecca.
It's gone.
In a few hours, you've grown so much older.
Oh, Maxim, Maxim.
Black Jack Brady was his name.
The most important arrest I ever made.
It must have been about two years ago now.
Of course, there was no doubt about it.
He was hung a month after I caught him. Hello. Wait a minute.
They've got old Balmy Ben up now.
You remember the late Mrs. De Winter, don't you? - She's gone.
- Yes, we know that.
- She went in the sea.
The sea got her. - That's right.
That's right. Now we want you to tell us whether you were on the shore
- that last night she went sailing. - Eh?
Were you on the shore that last night she went out, when she didn't come back?
I didn't see nothing. I don't want to go to the asylum.
Them cruel folks there.
Now, nobody's going to send you to the asylum.
All we want you to do is tell us what you saw.
I didn't see nothing.
Come, come. Did you see Mrs. De Winter get into her boat that last night?
I don't know nothing. I don't want to go to the asylum.
Very well. You may go. - Eh?
- You may go now. - Mr. Tabb, step forward, please.
- Yes?
The evidence you give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do, so help me God.
The late Mrs. De Winter used to send her boat
- to your shipyard for reconditioning.
- That's right, sir.
Can you remember any occasion when she had any sort of accident with the boat?
I often said Mrs. De Winter was a born sailor.
Now, when Mrs. De Winter went below, as is supposed, and a sudden gust of wind came down, that would be enough to capsize the boat, wouldn't it?
Excuse me, sir. But there's a little more to it than that.
- What do you mean, Mr. Tabb?
- I mean, sir, the seacocks.
What are the seacocks?
Sea...
The seacocks are the valves to drain out the boat.
They're always kept tight closed when you're afloat. Yes?
Well, yesterday, when I examined that boat, I found they'd been opened.
What could be the reason for that?
Just this, that's what flooded the boat and sunk her.
Are you implying that boat never capsized at all?
I know it's a terrible thing to say, sir, but in my opinion, she was scuttled.
- And there's them holes.
- What holes? - In her planking.
- What are you talking about?
Of course, that boat's been underwater for over a year, and the tide's been knocking her against the ridge.
But it seemed to me them holes looked as if she'd made them from the inside.
Then you believe she must have done it deliberately.
Couldn't have been no accident, not with her knowledge of boats.
You knew the former Mrs. De Winter very well, I believe? Oh, yes.
Would you have believed her capable of suicide?
No. Frankly, I would not.
But you never can tell.
You may stand down, Mr. Tabb.
Mr. De Winter, please.
Sorry to drag you back for further questioning, Mr. De Winter. But you've heard the statement of Mr. Tabb.
I wonder if you can help us in any way.
I'm afraid not.
Can you think of any reason why there should be holes in the planking of the late Mrs. De Winter's boat?
Well, of course I can't think of any reason.
Has anyone ever discussed these holes with you before? Well, since the boat has been at the bottom of the ocean,
I scarcely think that likely.
Mr. De Winter, I want you to believe we all feel very deeply for you in this matter.
But you must remember that I don't conduct this inquiry for my own amusement.
- That's rather obvious, isn't it?
- I hope that it is.
Well, since she went sailing alone, are we to believe that she drove those holes herself?
You may believe what you like.
Can you enlighten us as to why Mrs. De Winter should have wanted to end her own life?
I know of no reason whatever.
Mr. De Winter, however painful it may be,
I have to ask you a very personal question.
Were relations between you and the late Mrs. De Winter perfectly happy?
I won't stand this any longer! You might as well know now...
We'll adjourn till after lunch.
Mr. De Winter, I presume you'll be available for us then?
I told you, you should have had some breakfast.
You're hungry. That's what's the matter with you.
Mr. Frith thought you might like to have some lunch from the house, and sent me with it.
No, that's fine. Pull around the corner.
Very good, sir.
Awfully foolish of me, fainting like that. Nonsense.
If you hadn't fainted like that, I'd have really lost my temper.
Darling, please be careful.
Darling, wait here a few moments.
I'll see if I can find old Frank. Of course, darling.
Don't worry about me.
I'll be all right. Sure?
Here, try a spot of this.
Thank you.
- Are you all right? - Yes, of course.
- I won't be long.
- Right you are.
And how does the bride find herself today?
I say, marriage with Max is not exactly a bed of roses, is it?
I think you'd better go before Maxim gets back. Oh, jealous, is he?
Well, I can't say I blame him.
But you don't think I'm the big bad wolf, do you?
I'm not, you know. I'm a perfectly ordinary, harmless bloke.
And I think you're behaving splendidly over all this.
Perfectly splendidly.
You know, you've grown up a bit since I last saw you.
It's no wonder...
What do you want, Favell?
Oh, hello, Max. Things are going pretty well for you, aren't they?
Better than you ever expected.
I was rather worried about you at first.
That's why I came down to the inquest. Well, I'm touched by your solicitude.
But if you don't mind, we'd rather like to have our lunch.
Lunch? I say, what a jolly idea. Rather like a picnic, isn't it?
I'm so sorry. Do you mind if I put this there?
You know, Max, old boy, I really think I ought to talk things over with you.
Talk what things over?
Well, those holes in the planking, for one thing.
Those holes that were drilled from the inside.
- Oh, Mullen?
- Yes, sir?
Would you, like a good fellow, have my car filled with petrol?
- It's almost empty. - Very good, sir.
- And, Mullen, close the door, will you?
Does this bother you?
You know, old boy, I have a strong feeling that before the day's out, somebody's going to make use of that rather expressive, though somewhat old-fashioned term, "foul play. "
Am I boring you with all this?
No? Good.
Well, you see, Max, I find myself in a rather awkward position.
You've only got to read this note to understand. It's from Rebecca.
And, what's more, she had the foresight to put a date on it.
She wrote me the day she died.
Incidentally, I was at a party on that night so I didn't get it until the next day.
And what makes you think that note would interest me?
Oh, I'm not gonna bother you with the contents now.
But I can assure you that it is not the note of a woman who intends to drown herself that same night.
By the way, what do you do with old bones?
Bury them?
However, for the time being...
You know, Max, I'm getting fed up with my job as a motorcar salesman.
I don't know if you've ever experienced the feeling of driving an expensive motorcar which isn't your own?
But it can be very, very exasperating.
You know what I mean. You want to own the car yourself.
I often wonder what it would be like to retire to the country.
Have a nice little place with a few acres of shooting.
I've never figured out what it would cost a year, but I'd like to talk about it with you.
I'd like to have your advice on how to live comfortably without hard work.
Hello, Favell. You looking for me, Maxim?
Yes. Mr. Favell and I have a little business transaction on hand.
I think we had better conduct it over at the inn.
They may have a private room there.
Well, see you later.
Find Colonel Julyan. Tell him I want to see him immediately.
Come on, Favell. Let's go.
- Have you a private room, please?
- Of course, sir. Through there, sir.
Hope this will do, Mr. De Winter.
Splendid. Splendid. Exactly like the Ritz.
Any orders, gents? Yes.
You might bring me a large brandy and soda.
How about you, Max? Have one on me. I feel I can afford to play host.
Thanks. I don't mind if I do.
Make it two, will you, like a good fellow?
- Very good, sir.
Where's Mr. De Winter?
Through the other door, sir.
Colonel Julyan, this is Mr. Favell.
Oh, I know Colonel Julyan. We're old friends, aren't we?
Since you're old friends, I assume you also know he's head of the police here.
He might be interested to hear your proposition. Tell him all about it.
I don't know what you mean.
I merely said I hoped to give up selling cars and retire into the country.
Actually, he offered to withhold a vital piece of evidence from the inquest if I made it worth his while.
I only want to see justice done, Colonel.
Now, that boat builder's evidence suggested certain possible theories concerning Rebecca's death.
One of them, of course, is suicide.
Now I have a little note here which I consider puts that possibility quite out of court.
Read it, Colonel.
"Jack, darling,
I've just seen the doctor and I'm going down to Manderley right away.
I shall be at the cottage all this evening and shall leave the door open for you.
I have something terribly important to tell you. Rebecca. "
Now, does that look like the note of a woman who had made up her mind to kill herself?
And apart from that, do you mean to tell me that if you wanted to commit suicide, you would go to all the trouble of putting out to sea in a boat, and then take a hammer and chisel
and laboriously knock holes through the bottom of it?
Come, Colonel.
As an officer of the law, don't you feel there are some slight grounds for suspicion?
- Of murder? - What else?
You've known Max a long time.
So you know he's the old-fashioned type, who'd die to defend his honor, or who'd kill for it.
It's blackmail, pure and simple.
And the blackmailer sometimes finds himself in jail at the end of it. Oh, I see.
You're going to hold de Winter's hand through all this.
Just because he's the big noise around here and he's actually permitted you to dine with him.
Be careful, Favell. You've brought an accusation of murder.
- Have you any witnesses?
- I do have a witness.
It's that fellow, Ben.
If that stupid coroner hadn't been as much of a snob as you are, he'd have seen that half-wit was hiding something.
And why should Ben do that?
Because we caught him once, Rebecca and I, peering at us through the cottage window.
Rebecca threatened him with the asylum. That's why he was afraid to speak.
But he was always hanging about. He must have seen this whole thing.
It's ridiculous, even listening to all this.
You're like a little trade union, all of you, aren't you?
And if my guess is right, Crawley, there's a bit of malice in your soul toward me, isn't there?
Crawley didn't have much success with Rebecca, but he ought to have more luck this time.
And the bride will be grateful for your fraternal arm, Crawley, in a week or so.
Every time she faints, in fact.
- De Winter!
- Maxim, please!
That temper of yours will do you in yet, Max.
Excuse me, gentlemen. - Now is there anything else?
- Yes. You might bring Mr. De Winter a sedative.
- No, no. Nothing at all. Just leave us.
- Very good.
Now, Favell, let's get this business over.
As you seem to have worked out the whole thing so carefully, perhaps you can provide us also with a motive.
I knew you were going to bring that up, Colonel.
I've read enough detective stories to know that there must always be a motive.
And if you'll all excuse me, I might supply that, too.
I wish you'd go home. You ought not to be here through all this.
Please let me stay, Maxim.
Surely, Colonel Julyan, you're not going to allow this fellow to...
My opinion of Favell is no higher than yours, Crawley.
But in my official capacity, I have no alternative but to pursue his accusations.
I entirely agree with you, Colonel.
In matters as serious as this, we must make sure of every point and explore every avenue.
And in fact, if I may coin a phrase, leave no stone unturned.
Here she is, the missing link, the witness who will help supply the motive.
Colonel Julyan, Mrs. Danvers. I believe you know everyone else.
Won't you sit down?
No offense, Colonel, but I think I'll put this to Danny.
She'll understand it more easily. Danny, who was Rebecca's doctor?
Mrs. De Winter always had Dr. McClean from the village.
Now, you heard. I said Rebecca's doctor in London.
I don't know anything about that.
Oh, don't give me that, Danny. You knew everything about Rebecca.
You knew she was in love with me, didn't you?
Surely you haven't forgotten the good times she and I used to have down at the cottage on the beach.
She had a right to amuse herself, didn't she?
Love was a game to her. Only a game. It made her laugh, I tell you.
She used to sit and rock with laughter at the lot of you.
Can you think of why Mrs. De Winter should have taken her own life?
No, no. I refuse to believe it.
I knew everything about her and I won't believe it. There.
You see? It's impossible. She knows that as well as I do.
Now, listen to me, Danny. We know that Rebecca went to a doctor in London on the last day of her life.
Who was it?
I don't know.
I understand, Danny.
You think we're asking you to reveal secrets of Rebecca's life.
You're trying to defend her. But that's what I'm doing.
I'm trying to clear her name of the suspicion of suicide.
Mrs. Danvers, it has been suggested that Mrs. De Winter was deliberately murdered.
There you have it in a nutshell, Danny.
But there's one more thing you'll want to know, the name of the murderer.
It's a lovely name that rolls off the tongue so easily.
George Fortescue Maximilian de Winter.
There was a doctor. Mrs. De Winter sometimes went to him privately.
She used to go to him even before she was married.
We don't want reminiscences, Danny.
Dr. Baker. 165 Goldhawk Road, Shepherd's Bush.
There you are, Colonel. There's where you'll find your motive.
Go and question Dr. Baker. He'll tell you why Rebecca went to him.
To confirm the fact that she was going to have a child.
A sweet, curly-headed little child.
It isn't true. It isn't true. She would have told me.
She told Max about it. Max knew he wasn't the father.
So, like the gentleman of the old school that he is, he killed her.
I'm afraid we shall have to question this Dr. Baker.
Hear, hear. But for safety's sake, I think I'd like to go along, too.
Yes. Unfortunately, I suppose you have the right to ask that.
I'll see the coroner and have the inquest postponed pending further evidence.
I say, aren't you rather afraid that the prisoner, shall we say, might bolt?
You have my word for it that he will not do that.
Toodle-oo, Max. Come along, Danny.
Let's leave the unhappy couple to spend their last moments together alone.
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you, Max?
No, darling. It'll be very tiring for you.
I'll be back the very first thing in the morning.
- And I won't even stop to sleep.
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Ready, Maxim?
- Yes.
You two go on ahead. I'll follow with Favell.
Dr. Baker, you may have seen
Mr. De Winter's name in the papers recently.
Yes. Yes. In connection with the body that was found in a boat.
My wife was reading all about it. A very sad case. My condolences.
This is going to take hours.
Don't bother, Favell. I think I can tell Dr. Baker.
We're trying to discover certain facts concerning the late Mrs. De Winter's activities on the day of her death.
October the 12th, last year.
I want you to tell me if you can, if anyone of that name paid you a visit on that date?
I'm awfully sorry. I'm afraid I can't help you.
I should have remembered the name de Winter.
I've never attended a Mrs. De Winter in my life.
How can you possibly tell all your patients' names?
I can look it up in my engagement diary if you like.
- Did you say the 12th of October?
Yes.
Here we are. No. No de Winter.
Are you sure?
Well, here are all the appointments for that day.
Ross, Campbell, Steadall, Perrino, Danvers...
- Danny? What the devil?
- Would you read that name again? Did you say Danvers?
Yes. I have a Mrs. Danvers for 3:00.
What did she look like? Can you remember?
Yes, I remember her quite well. She was a very beautiful woman.
- Tall, dark, exquisitely dressed.
Rebecca.
The lady must have used an assumed name.
Is that so? This is a surprise. I've known her a long time.
What was the matter with her?
Well, there are certain ethics.
Could you supply a reason, Dr. Baker, for Mrs. De Winter's suicide?
For her murder, you mean? She was going to have a kid, wasn't she?
Come on. Out with it!
Tell me, what else would a woman of her class be doing in a dump like this?
I take it the official nature of this visit makes it necessary for me to...
I assure you we'd not be troubling you if it were not necessary.
You want to know if I can suggest any motive as to why Mrs. De Winter should have taken her life?
Yes, I think I can.
The woman who called herself Mrs. Danvers was very seriously ill.
She was not going to have a child?
That was what she thought. My diagnosis was different.
I sent her to a well-known specialist for an examination and x-rays.
And on this date, she returned to me for his report.
I remember her standing here holding out her hand for the photograph.
"I want to know the truth, " she said.
"I don't want soft words and a bedside manner.
If I'm for it, you can tell me right away. "
I knew she was not the type to accept a lie.
She'd asked for the truth, so I let her have it.
She thanked me. I never saw her again, so I assumed...
- What was wrong with her?
- Cancer.
Yes, the growth was deep-rooted.
An operation would have been no earthly use at all.
In a short time, she would have been under morphia.
There was nothing that could be done for her, except wait.
Did she say anything when you told her?
She smiled in a queer sort of way.
Your wife was a wonderful woman, Mr. De Winter.
And, oh, yes, I remember she said something that struck me as being very peculiar at the time.
When I told her it was a matter of months, she said,
"Oh, no, Doctor, not that long. "
You've been very kind. You've told us all we wanted to know.
We shall need an official verification.
- Verification?
- Yes. - To confirm the verdict of suicide.
I understand. Can I offer you gentlemen a glass of sherry?
No, that's very kind. I think we ought to be going.
Thank heaven we know the truth.
Dreadful thing. Dreadful.
Young and lovely woman like that. No wonder...
I never had the remotest idea. Neither did Danny, I'm sure.
I wish I had a drink.
Will we be needed at the inquest any further, Colonel Julyan? No, no.
I can see to it that Maxim's not troubled any further. - Thank you, sir.
- You ready to start, Colonel?
No, thank you.
I'm staying in town tonight.
And let me tell you, Favell, blackmail is not much of a profession.
And we know how to deal with it in our part of the world, strange as it may seem to you.
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
But if you ever need a new car, Colonel, just let me know.
It's impossible to thank you for your kindness to us through all this.
You know what I feel without my saying it. Not at all.
Put the whole thing behind you.
But let your wife know. She'll be getting worried. Yes, of course.
I'll phone her at once and we'll get straight down to Manderley. Goodbye, Crawley.
Maxim's got a great friend.
- Frank.
- Yes, Maxim?
- There's something you don't know.
- Oh, no, there isn't.
I didn't kill her, Frank.
But I know now that when she told me about the child, she wanted me to kill her.
She lied on purpose. She foresaw the whole thing.
That's why she stood there laughing when she...
Don't think about it anymore.
Thank you, Frank.
Hello, Danny. I just wanted to tell you the news.
Rebecca held out on both of us. She had cancer.
Yes, suicide.
Now Max and that dear little bride of his will be able to stay on at Manderley and live happily ever after.
Bye-bye, Danny.
- This your car, sir?
- Yes.
Will you be going soon? This isn't a parking place, you know. Oh, isn't it?
Well, people are entitled to leave cars outside if they want to.
It's a pity some of you fellows haven't anything better to do.
When you phoned, did she say she'd wait up?
I asked her to go to bed, but she wouldn't hear of it.
I wish I could get some more speed out of this thing.
Is something worrying you, Maxim?
I can't get over the feeling something's wrong.
- Frank. - What's the matter?
Why did we stop?
What's the time? Well, this clock's wrong.
It must be 3:00 or 4:00. Why?
That can't be the dawn breaking over there.
It's in the winter that you see the northern lights, isn't it?
That's not the northern lights. That's Manderley.
Frith! Frith! Mrs. De Winter.
- I thought I saw her, sir. - Where?
Maxim!
Thank heavens you've come back to me!
- Are you all right, darling? - Oh, yes, I am. Are you all right?
Mrs. Danvers, she's gone mad.
She said she'd rather destroy Manderley than see us happy here.
Look! The west wing!
- How's it going, Joe?
- Okay. Fill her up.
- What are you hauling?
- Apples.
- How's your brother, Paul?
- Asleep.
Every time you come here, he's asleep and you're driving.
- What is he, a growing boy?
- He drives as much as I do.
You run your station, we'll take care of our rig.
I was just wondering.
This is the nearest I've had to a bath in two weeks.
Yeah, I noticed.
Seventy gallons of gas, three quarts of oil in your crankcase...
- I'll have to get you on the way back.
- Five quarts in your spare...
What did you say?
I can't pay till I drop off this load.
- Why didn't you say that?
- You wouldn't have given me the gas.
I'll say. I got a notion to siphon it out of there.
You know I ain't selling gas on time.
Relax. I wouldn't gyp you. I'm honest.
I know you are. All you truckers are honest, but you're always broke.
The finance company comes, you're out of business, and I never see dough.
Don't worry. He's gotta catch me first.
That won't be tough, you ain't driving any speedway special. Sign it.
- Twelve dollars and 90 cents.
- Don't overflow your tank.
On the cuff. How do you like that?
- You'll get it on the trip back.
- You didn't pay for this pop.
Put it on the bill.
- Where are we?
- Not far from Lansdale.
- You should have woke me up.
- It's okay.
We'll grab a cup of coffee at Barney's. Then you can wheel it into Los Angeles.
How's about laying over at my house for a couple of days?
I'm knocked out.
I'd like to stay in bed for a week, not even get up to eat.
So would I.
But that ain't the way we get ahead.
I gotta think of Pearl. I ain't been home for two weeks.
She might as well be married to an explorer.
Look out, Joe!
You dirty son of a road hog!
- You should've smacked into him.
- What is that gonna get us?
What do we do now?
You watch the load, I'm gonna hop up to Barney's and phone Williams.
And see if he'll send some of the dough he owes us.
Thanks.
Hi, Harry.
Hello, Joe. Where's your rig?
- Down the road. Busted wheel.
- Oh, tough going. Can I help?
I'm gonna phone Williams to send the dough he owes me.
I hope you get it. I quit hauling for that crook.
Ran me ragged and I hardly ever got paid.
He'll pay me now, or he won't get his apples in L.A. On time.
You got him over a barrel, that's different. Maybe you'll get it.
- Come on. We go.
- Yeah, he's right.
Can't make no dough drinking coffee.
Good luck, guy.
- Same to you.
- Thanks.
Oh, Harry! Write your wife. I hear she's worried.
Okay, I will. Thanks.
- Hello, Joe.
- Hello, Jake. How's it going?
- Give me a Frisco phone book, will you?
- Yeah.
Be sure you bring back all the pages too.
So I'm telling you, see here I am with these two beautiful dames.
They're hanging around my neck, begging me not to go.
I tell them, "Look, sisters, I got a job to do".
So I push them away and leave.
After all, a guy like me with hundreds of dames...
I'm getting out of here. Come on, Shorty. It's too deep for me.
I'm losing my touch. Give me some nickels, Barney.
Joe!
Where you been, guy?
Been getting any good hauls?
Some. How they been for you, Irish?
I still get my check every Saturday.
But you get ordered around every other day. Ain't for me.
Hey, Red, this steak's tough.
You can't send it back now. You bent it.
- I'll be back this way tonight, Red.
- Thanks for the warning.
Give me the phone, will you?
- What, you keep it in a vault?
- Don't call New York.
Another cup of java.
- You must like our coffee.
- It stinks.
You're drinking your seventh cup.
I like your sugar. Why don't you and your brother quit wildcat trucking?
With a legitimate company, this is a swell job.
Why don't you get smart like me and work for Ed Carlsen?
- Give me long distance.
- Hey!
Relax, I'm reversing the charges.
There's only one guy I'd sooner work for than Carlsen.
- Who?
- Me.
You ain't working for you, you're working for the finance company.
Soon as your truck's paid for, you'll need another one.
Hello?
I wanna talk to Mike Williams. Standard 7-2961, San Francisco.
Reverse the charges. Joe Fabrini calling.
Don't worry about me.
Someday you road-skinners will say, "Joe Fabrini's a good guy to work for".
- And I will be.
- No doubt about that, kid, but me I'll take the salary and let someone else worry.
That's the easy way. Give me a cup of coffee.
- Anything else?
- What else you got that ain't poisonous?
I don't know. I never eat here.
- How about taking my order, Red?
- How about taking your time?
Nice new fixture, Barney.
Yeah. She'll do.
Not a bad thing to know. Nice chassis, huh, Joe?
Classy chassis.
Yes, and it's all mine too. I don't owe any payments on it.
I'd be glad to finance it, baby.
Who are you kidding?
You couldn't even pay for the headlights.
What?
He won't accept the call?
Wait a minute. Hey, Irish.
Lend me a buck, I wanna pay for the call.
Get a load of the big trucking operator.
I still vote for a salary.
Okay. I'll pay for it at this end.
This is 2212.
Anything else?
Yeah, but it ain't on the menu.
And it ain't gonna be. You better settle for a hamburger.
Okay. With onions.
Hello, Mike Williams?
What's the idea of ducking my phone call?
I never take collect calls. Where are you?
Barney's café, north of Lansdale, 99.
You got a busted wheel?
Look, Fabrini, those apples have gotta be delivered to the market tonight.
- That ain't wood you're hauling.
- Okay, I'll get the apples in but send me some of that 300 bucks you owe me so I can get a new wheel.
Yeah, wire it to me, right here.
Well, I ain't got much cash right now, Joe.
All right, all right, don't get excited. I'll see what I can do.
Who do those Fabrini guys think they are, anyhow?
I've thrown more business their way than any freight agent in town...
- ...and I ain't sending money.
- The apples won't get to L.A.
They will if somebody else hauls them. Who's up there near Lansdale?
Hank Dawson. He's due there and we don't owe him much money.
You get him on the phone and tell him to pick up Fabrini's load.
Those Fabrinis are tough babies.
They only think they're tough.
Say, is Farnsworth still outside?
- He was a minute ago.
- Tell that loan shark I wanna see him.
But you fellas don't understand. Everything I do is within the law.
All I can say is, we need a lot of new laws.
Hey, the boss wants to talk to you.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Bye-bye, buzzard. What's the matter with the man?
Tell me, Farnsworth, do the Fabrinis owe you any dough on that truck?
I've been trying to catch them.
They're behind three payments, plus my interest.
I know all about your interest. Would you like to repossess the truck?
- Yeah, certainly.
- Here's your chance.
They're stuck with a busted wheel near Barney's café on 99.
- Get a tow car and haul in the rig.
- Thanks. I'll do you a favor sometime.
Just don't lend me any money. That's all I ask of you.
You know what happened?
The guy had an iron...
- What are you doing here?
- I got blisters waiting so I hitched to Lansdale and got a secondhand wheel.
Told the guy I'd get the dough.
- What about the load?
- Got a kid watching it.
- How'd you make out with Williams?
- I'm still waiting for the dough.
Why do we stay in this racket?
We aren't gonna make enough to buy ourselves decent coffins.
Stop crabbing. I got enough worries.
Get that into you. We gotta start rolling.
All right, that's enough of the x-ray treatment.
Don't get me wrong, sister.
All you make me think about is how much I'd like to be with my wife.
First time I've ever heard that one.
- I ain't got a wife.
- That's not hard to understand.
If any of you guys owe on your trucks, you better fade.
Farnsworth's coming.
- Where's Fabrini?
- With Byrd, at the South Pole.
Fishing with the president.
I heard he was playing left end for Notre Dame.
It ain't nothing personal. He bought a truck and he's gotta pay.
Why?
Everything on that pile makes noise except the horn.
I'm standing on my legal rights! I gotta make a living too.
- Why?
- Because it says in the law...
I ain't gonna argue with you fellas. Miss, did you see Joe Fabrini around?
I know he's been here.
- He pulled out more than an hour ago.
- Yeah?
Whose wheel is that outside?
It's mine.
- Wanna make anything out of it?
- Now, no offense.
Listen, runt, we don't like you around here.
- Throw him out, boy!
- I'm warning you!
There he goes!
Yeah!
He's over for a touchdown!
Thanks, honey. I'll do you a favor sometime.
That's all right, I don't like them either. They got a coat of mine once.
- How much do we owe for the chow?
- Thirty-six.
- Here you are. Keep the change.
- Thanks.
It's all right. He's on his way.
- Thanks, fellas. I'll be seeing you.
- So long, Joe.
- Take it easy, Joe.
- Come on, kid.
- Where's the wheel?
- Right over there.
If we're lucky, maybe we can get a ride.
Who's this?
Hi, Dawson.
- Hello. How are you, Joe?
- Hello. Will you give us a lift?
- We had some trouble.
- Williams told me.
- Williams?
- Yeah.
He sent me here to pick up your load.
That dirty muzzler.
We carry the load all this way and we don't get a dime.
- Suppose we don't give it to you.
- You can suit yourself but if you miss market, you'll take a rap for the whole load.
- Yeah, just let him try to collect.
- Shut up.
Of course he'll collect, out of the dough he owes us.
You're a nice guy, Dawson.
- Why do you pull stuff like this?
- It ain't my fault, Joe.
I got a wife and a kid and another one on the way.
I gotta do what Williams says, or I don't get no hauls.
- Don't get sore at me.
- I'd like to kick that chiseler's teeth out.
That ain't gonna get you nothing, and besides, Hank ain't interested.
Come on. Let's hop in.
- Give us a hand, will you?
- Yeah, sure.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
That's it.
Our rig's about two miles down the road.
And where do we go from there?
We better go back to Frisco and see Williams.
By the time I get home to my wife I'll be too tired to turn out the light.
Come on, Williams ought to be in his office by now.
What if he don't see it?
What do you think?
Hello, Joe.
How they rolling?
How's that broken-down tub of yours?
No loads yet. Hang around.
What do you think we been doing?
Tell Williams we want to see him.
You guys again?
You heard me say there ain't any loads.
Who said we wanted any?
We don't get paid for them anyway.
Oh, hello, boys. How'd you get back?
What's the difference?
We should wrap a crank around you.
We got a hunch it was you put Farnsworth on our tail.
What did I want to see you boys lose your truck for?
I got some beer hauls in mind for you, something coming up soon.
Beer's out, you bring back the empties. Three hauls a week, how'd you like that?
- We'd like it fine if we got paid.
- You been horsing around enough.
We ought to break your neck for leaving us stuck then lifting our load.
What, you want me to dig into my pocket every time you fold a wheel or blow a tire?
- I'm just as broke as you are.
- What is this, tin?
Here, here, here. Where's your manners, anyhow?
Going into a man's papers.
You owe us 300 bucks and you're gonna pay us now!
- If you don't...!
- All right!
Don't get hot.
- I'll give you a check.
- What'll we do, use it for a tire patch?
We'll take it out of here. Cash.
Let go of him, Paul, and write out a receipt.
You know, there's a law against taking people's money.
That was so, you'd have been in the clink years ago.
I knew you'd see it our way.
You mark my words, you guys are gonna regret this.
We're tired of taking chances and leaving you the dough.
That's the worst of you road slobs! Always getting too big for your britches!
But I don't mind telling you one thing: This is the last load you'll ever get here.
In that case, we haven't got anything to lose, have we?
There's your receipt.
There's a bad curve sitting out front.
It's got mud on it. Be careful.
Go to sleep, will you?
I'm driving now.
I was just reminding you.
If we go over a cliff, wake me up.
Pour on the brakes.
If we stop and pick up everybody we see on the road we ain't gonna get in till next week.
It's a dame. It won't hurt to get her out of the rain.
It's too bad one of them hotshot passenger cars couldn't give her a lift.
Come on, hop in.
Thanks. I was beginning to wonder if I'd ever get a ride.
Well, you got one now, so relax.
You're the dame that was slinging hash at Barney's.
- That's me.
- Well, what happened?
Barney had about 12 hands, and I didn't like any of them.
Barney's all right.
You didn't have to pass him 100 times a day.
- It was like tangling with an octopus.
- How far you going?
- How far are you going?
- We're going to L.A.
That's okay by me.
I'd just as soon be out of a job one place as another.
Wait a minute.
I better wrap you up.
- What's your name, Red?
- Cassie Hartley.
You know anyone in L. A?
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- Get a room, look for work.
Jobs ain't growing on bushes these days.
- How much dough you got?
- Enough to get by.
You're gonna lose your teeth chattering if we don't get something hot into you.
Pull into Mandel's, Paul. We've been rolling pretty good.
Pearl's waiting up for me.
I was going to spend an hour with her.
So you'll spend a half-hour with her. Oh, look.
It's clearing up. We'll be all right.
Don't stop on my account.
We gotta stop, it might as well be Mandel's.
That ain't home.
Pearl can't cook a steak like Billy Mandel.
I ain't interested in steaks.
How come you're here? Ain't you behind schedule?
I've been having tough luck. I won 48 free games.
I tried to shoot them, but I kept winning. Only three games and then I roll.
And I'll have to push my foot through the floorboard to make up my schedule.
What will it be, boys?
A T-bone, rare, and make it good this time.
The last one I had could've been used for a manhole cover.
This one will be so tender, it'll throw its arms around you.
- Same for you?
- Yeah.
I'll just have some coffee.
- Bring her a steak.
- Fattening her up, huh?
- Something else for you, honey? - Yes.
Cool off your imagination.
Hey, McNamara. Where are you going?
- What's it to you?
- Come on. We go.
What's the matter?
Don't you know me?
- Hello, Joe.
- Come on. Sit down, Harry.
- What are you guys doing here?
- What do you suppose we're doing?
- Have a cup of coffee?
- I had five.
Don't do any good. I'm still sleepy.
- Come on. We go.
- Yeah, he's right.
I haven't seen my wife for so long.
As soon as I deliver this load, I'm hot-tailing it home empty.
Bet when I walk in the kids will say, "Who's that man?"
You should have wrote, Harry. I know how worried Pearl gets.
No use writing now.
I'll be home tomorrow night and surprise her.
I hear you've been doing pretty good.
Yeah. I got the truck all paid for. Don't owe a cent.
Come on. Let's go.
When you guys are hitting the road tomorrow think of me in that nice white bed.
So long, guys.
So long, Harry.
Well, you gotta have your brains knocked out to be a truck driver.
You don't have to, but it helps.
Here she goes, boys, the last game. Then I can hit the road.
I don't know why I mess with them machines.
They almost cost me my job three times.
Irish, you remember Cassie.
Sure. Hi, Cassie. Quit working for Barney?
Yeah. He was always trying to tie my apron strings.
- There's nothing wrong with that.
- There is if you're not wearing an apron.
Fifty-eight free games!
I'll never get away from here.
- What's that for?
- Gonna pass.
If it's clear ahead, he'll wink back at me.
That's funny. It looks clear to me. Hey, Paul.
Yeah?
What is it?
Ain't that McNamara's truck ahead of us?
What do I care whose truck it is?
Yeah, it looks like it.
It is.
What's the matter with him?
He's all over the road.
- He must be asleep.
- Blow your horn.
Not unless I have to.
He might come to and run his rig off the road.
- We gotta try to head him off.
- Watch out he don't cut into us.
Get over close. I'll try to hit his hood with this and wake him up.
Pull over closer and I'll try to hop aboard!
Watch out!
Grab the extinguisher!
- How many in there?
- There were two.
Oh, Paul, you're late.
How's about coming in for some coffee, Joe?
Oh, this is Cassie Hartley.
This is Pearl, Paul's wife.
- Hello.
- Pleased to know you.
Come on, it's cold out here.
Can't stop. I'll about make the market now.
- What's wrong with Paul?
- He'll be all right.
He just needs a good night's sleep.
Tell him I'll wire him from L.A. What time I'll pick him up.
Bye. Goodbye.
Bye.
I can't figure you out.
If you took care of your truck like yourselves, it'd fall apart in two weeks.
We're tougher than any truck off any assembly line.
I bet your friend Harry McNamara thought that too.
Forget about Harry, will you?
He probably was so tired, he thought the whole thing was a dream.
How much money you got?
Come on, how much?
- A dollar and 12 cents.
- Just what I thought.
Not even enough to rent a room.
- I'll get by.
- How?
I get rid of this load, I'll get you a room.
You needn't do that. I'm grateful for the ride.
You've been nice.
If I let you go, I'll be worrying, wondering what happened to you.
And I got enough worries the way it is.
I guess I'd be pretty dumb not to say yes.
Maybe I'm dumb anyway.
You can figure that out later.
I ain't used to taking in roomers at 4:30 in the morning.
It's never too late to start. The best people check in at 4:30.
I don't know about that. I never see any of them.
Well, anyway, you got a bed for a week.
Yeah. That'll give me time to find something to do.
- I'll pay you back.
- I'm real worried about that.
I got it all doped out with the cops if you don't.
What are you crying for?
I don't know. Just crying.
If you got a load of your face, you'd stop.
You look like you walked through a sprinkling system.
Oh, you dames are sure screwy.
Paul's wife pulls the same stuff too.
What stuff?
One minute she's all right, the next minute, she's bawling.
She never knows why.
The trouble with her is, she wants a kid.
Paul says no-go. They can't afford it.
Don't get me wrong. That's not why I'm crying.
I get a kick out of you.
I've picked up lots of girls on the road, but none of them ever was like you.
Come here.
Come on, I ain't gonna bite you.
I wasn't afraid of that.
I always have liked redheads.
You shouldn't. Red means stop.
I'm colorblind.
I think I'd better unpack.
Joe, don't you think you'd better get on your horse?
What's the rush?
We got a lot of things to talk about.
We can talk some other time.
Now is a nice time.
When I'm relaxed my thoughts are clear.
Yes, I can even read them from here.
You know something, Red?
I like you.
I like the way you fill out your clothes.
I like everything about you.
Are you glad you ran onto me?
Yes. You're a nice guy.
But you've got to remember that nice guys leave when ladies ask them to.
That nice, I ain't.
Mister, you worry me.
Oh, Cassie?
You're plenty beautiful.
Joe, you need sleep and so do I.
Will you do me a favor and get going?
Joe?
Joe.
I'm sorry I woke you up, I was trying to shut out the kid noise.
That's all right.
I gotta get going.
You sure slept.
That's the first time I've been in a bed in weeks. It felt good.
- Where did you sleep?
- Chair.
Oh, I'm sorry, kid. I didn't mean to gyp you out of your bed.
You didn't mean anything. You went out like you were slugged.
You ought to get yourself a regular job.
What do you see in the trucking business?
I'm on my own, anyway.
If a guy can get two or three big rigs, there's a fortune in this business.
You really believe that, don't you?
Sure, I believe it. If I didn't, I'd be on Paul's side.
I'd quit right now, let Farnsworth take the truck and go grab a job digging ditches.
After what I saw last night, digging ditches looks good to me.
No future in it.
A shave wouldn't go bad, but I ain't got time now.
I gotta get to market and hustle up a load.
- When will you be back?
- That depends. Maybe a couple of days.
- Good. I'll have a job by then.
- That's the talking.
In the meantime, you gotta eat.
This won't take you into the Cocoanut Grove but you'll get enough till I get back.
You must be out of your mind. You may never see me again.
Don't worry about that. I'll see you.
Joe.
- Don't go to sleep on the road.
- I won't. Not after a pepper-up like that.
And don't practice that on anyone else.
Save it for me.
- Hiya, fatso.
- How are you, Joe?
Oh, I been eating. Where you going?
Gonna pick up some watermelons.
- Who gave you the load?
- Me.
A guy would get blisters waiting for a load so I'm going down to Imperial and buy some of them babies myself.
When market opens, I'll clean up.
You know, they ain't hardly got a watermelon in town.
That's one way to do it. Well, good luck, guy.
Thanks. Same to you.
What do you think you're doing with that broken-down tub?
Parking it. Why?
Get it out of there, or I'll park one on your chin. I was here first.
Don't look that way to me.
Smack him on the chin, boy. Shoot for his button. Go on!
Go on!
What's going on?
Well, it ain't the guy selling bananas, it's a fight!
Look!
Get in there, now!
Go ahead, go ahead!
Ed, stop yelling out the window. You're not a truck driver anymore.
Can I help it if I get a little excited?
When we got married, you promised to be a gentleman.
It's disgusting to see the head of a big company being noisier than his drivers.
One of those guys looks like Joe Fabrini.
It is Joe!
You remember Joe, don't you?
Yeah.
And Joe shouldn't be fighting in the street like that too.
You'll need the other eye for the road.
And this ain't making either one of us any money.
Look out, Joe.
Hey, Joe Fabrini!
Champ!
Hey, Joe!
Joe Fabrini!
Come on up here and see what you can do with a good man.
I used to could hit like that. And get hit too.
- Oh, boy.
- Is he coming up?
Yeah, and a great guy he is too.
Say, Lana, what are you doing with all the dough?
This is 200 bucks this week.
Would you like me to give you an itemized account?
Penny by penny?
Oh, no, sug. You use all of it you want.
If you're gonna look like a million, you got to spend a million, huh?
I just got my makeup on. You need to get romantic around noontime?
Where you're concerned, I don't watch the clock.
I wish you would.
You're having a visitor, you may as well put your coat on.
If you can't sound like an executive, you might try looking like one.
You're gonna make a gentleman out of me yet.
I doubt it.
What is it?
What is it?
Yes?
What...?
Oh, I wish they'd stop inventing things.
Joe Fabrini to see you.
What?
Oh, well, shoot him right in.
Hello, Joe. What do you know?
Who do you think you are, Jack Dempsey?
What is that, a gag?
It's Lana. She thinks it makes me look dignified.
- What was the beef out there?
- Oh, nothing much.
- Hello, Mrs. Carlsen.
- Hello.
Where have you been hiding?
It's a wonder you wouldn't come see a guy.
- I've been pretty busy.
- The mice must have got into this.
That was no mice, that was a rat.
Very funny. Very funny, babe!
That's just like Lana. Right on the trigger every time.
Well, you and I will strike a blow for liberty.
- You know I never touch it.
- That's all right.
I'll strike the blow for both of us.
Well...
Your liver must look like a bomb hit it.
Well, you know what I say, live and let liver.
Or, or, liver, stay away from my door.
It's a cinch to think of fast ones when you've been married to a smart girl for seven years.
Now, Joe, park it there.
Oh, thanks.
Say, Joe why don't you cut out trying to beat this wildcat game and work for me?
- You beat it, didn't you?
- Well, yes.
You're leading with your chin.
Working for me or any other real trucking outfit, you can only drive 8 hours at a clip and you're sure of both your sleep and your pay.
- You know what I'm gonna do, Ed?
- No.
Paul and me are starting to buy our own loads.
After this, we're gonna make the profits instead of 16 other guys.
I'm just getting five brand-new diesels.
I'd sure like to see you and Paul on one of them.
Thanks, Ed, but I'd still like to be my own boss.
You should listen to Ed. He's talking sense for once.
Oh, don't get me wrong, Mrs. Carlsen I probably sound like I don't appreciate Ed's offer.
I do.
But I'd still like to try it my way.
Just a few breaks, and maybe I'll be higher than Ed.
Yeah, and Ed'll be hauling for you. What do you think of that?
- Know where you can buy any loads?
- No, I ain't looked into it yet.
I know just the guy. He knows all the angles.
And since I'm gonna be working for you someday, I might as well start getting on your good side.
And you better be nice to him too.
- I'm always nice to your friends.
- You see that one?
She kills me!
I'll be right back.
- Where were you last Thursday?
- On the road, I guess.
You're lying. You were here in town. One of the boys saw you.
So I was in town.
I waited so long in front of that restaurant, they thought I was a picket.
Don't you ever keep a date?
I didn't make a date.
You did.
I told you then I wouldn't be there.
And I'm telling you now...
- ... I'll never be there.
- What's the matter with me?
Nothing except you got a husband, Mrs. Carlsen.
And it happens that he's a good friend of mine. Understand?
Oh, you've been listening to some narrow-minded people.
There. What would they say about that?
You know what's gonna happen to you?
One of these days, Ed is gonna catch you.
And when he does, he's gonna slap your ears off.
I wonder what I see in you, anyway.
You're crude. You're uneducated.
You've never had a pair of pants with a crease in them.
And yet, I couldn't say no to you.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not asking you.
You better get two cases.
Bourbon!
- Joe.
- Yes.
Go here. That's the United Warehouse in Pomona.
Ask for Oscar Drake. He's got a load of lemons he's dying to get rid of.
That ain't bad. There's a flu epidemic up north and they're hot for lemons.
The guy's had the fruit laying around for some time, so you got him over a barrel.
- Got any money?
- Enough for a load.
- Thanks, Ed. I won't forget this.
- I know.
Goodbye, Mrs. Carlsen.
Goodbye. It was nice seeing you again, Joe.
Don't forget, keep your eye on that white line.
You betcha. And I'll watch all the curves too.
Now, there's a great fellow.
There's anybody in the world could beat that wildcat racket, it's him.
- Funny how the dames fell for him.
- Can't understand it.
Neither can I. Course, I mean waitresses and such.
None of them were high-class broads... I mean, gals, like yourself.
Oh, please, Ed. Suppose someone should come in?
Then we'd have to get married all over again, wouldn't we?
Yes, thank you.
- Who was it?
- It was a wire from Joe.
He'll be by for you in about a half an hour.
Paul.
I think you'd better let Joe go on again. You didn't sleep.
Well, how could I?
Every time I closed my eyes, I could see those two guys burning.
Well, I'm thankful it wasn't you.
Every minute, I expect someone to knock on the door and tell me I'm a widow.
- Please stay tonight and get some sleep.
- I can't.
I was enough of a heel last night, walking out on Joe the way I did.
I guess I'd try anything to keep you home one more day.
I'm alone so much, it's got me talking to myself.
Paul.
Why can't I have a baby?
Maybe then I wouldn't be so... so lonely.
There you go, singing the same old song.
- You know we can't afford a kid.
- It's the same old song from you.
How long do you think I'm gonna stay young enough?
The girls I went to school with have two or three kids now.
The girls you went to school with were smart to marry guys with real jobs.
Paul, I'm not blaming you. I'm complaining for both of us.
We've got a right to a better life than this.
You could get a job and though there wasn't much money, you'd get it every week, be home nights.
- Yeah, try and tell that to Joe.
- Who are you married to, Joe or me?
I can't leave him out on a limb as long as he thinks we got a chance in this.
And there he is now. He must have burned the rubber off that rig.
Well, I'll see you in a couple of days.
- Paul, be careful.
- Don't worry, honey.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Listen, we'll have so many kids, we'll run out of names.
Hiya, Fabrini.
- Oh, hiya.
- Your truck around?
Yeah. I got it parked under the kitchen sink.
There's no use getting smart. I'm acting within my legal rights.
You're three installments behind. Either you pay or I take the truck!
- You and who else?
- Me.
And don't try to get tough about it, buddy. Where's the truck?
- I don't know.
- It'll be along.
- He and his brother ride together.
- I ain't riding with him anymore.
He may not be by here for a couple of weeks.
That's all right. We'll wait.
If you get thirsty, come on in and I'll give you a mickey.
I'm going out the back and head Joe off at the highway.
If you didn't do anything, we'd be out of the business.
You'd get that job with regular pay, and be home nights.
- It's what we both want.
- Yeah, that's what I want, all right.
But I don't want to get it by double-crossing Joe.
If I can save the rig, I gotta save it.
Keep rolling!
Farnsworth's at the house with the law.
Well, he ain't got us this time.
What's the difference?
He'll get us the next.
- What are we hauling?
- Lemons.
- Who for?
- Ourselves.
What do you mean?
I bought the load with the money we got from Williams.
- All of it?
- All of it.
Except 2 bucks for rolling dough.
- I bought the stuff for 80 cents a box.
- Are you nuts?
Relax, will you?
When we sell the load, we'll have twice what we started with.
You mean, if we sell the load.
Hey, don't I rate in this outfit?
What am I, just a stooge?
Half of that dough was mine. Mine and Pearl's.
Don't I even get asked about anything?
A guy's gotta be around before you ask him.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I shouldn't have walked out on you, Joe.
That's all right.
I almost threw in the towel myself.
Well, did you see any of your old girlfriends in L. A?
Nope. Didn't have time.
What do you mean?
Joe Fabrini didn't have time to see even one dame?
You heard me.
It's just like I've been saying. This business is really tearing us down.
- Hiya, boys. What do you got?
- A load of lemons. Wanna see them?
I really don't want no lemons, but I guess it won't hurt if I take a look.
You can have a look.
- How's the market?
- Oh, only fair.
Drop it right down there.
- Hear you got married.
- Oh, forget that.
- Nice stuff, eh?
- This ain't no lemon, this is a lemonette.
Don't try to kid us.
- We know good stuff when we see it.
- I hate lemons, even if they're good.
Quit stalling, George. How do you like them?
It all depends upon what you're asking, boys.
- Well, we'll leave that up to you.
- Since you come to see me first...
- ... I'll give you $3.50 a box.
- Oh, no. No deal.
Come on, give me a hand, Paul.
Wait a minute, boys.
I'll treat you right, you know that. Name your own price.
Well, we hauled this stuff a long way and we paid a good price for them.
- We figure they're worth 5 bucks a box.
- You got me mixed up with Santa Claus.
Okay. No hard feelings.
Come on, Paul. We'll take them down to Riley's. We might even get 6 from him.
I tell you what I'll do, guys.
I'll give you $4 a box, but I want you to throw in some fill-ins.
We bought 145 boxes, and that's what we're selling.
Okay, robber.
145 boxes at $4 a box is 580 simoleons. That's all you'll get.
I don't know, George, I...
All right, it's a deal.
Hey, Junior, Harvey!
Dump that load.
- I'll get you your money.
- All right, George.
Here, you always liked apples.
I hope I never have another 5 minutes like that again.
We made 500 profit on the deal. We should have a lot of 5 minutes like that.
- Well, we're finally rolling.
- It looks that way. What next?
We'll buy another load. Then we'll buy some more loads.
Then we'll buy another truck. Then buy some more trucks.
Whoa, wait a minute. Maybe we better pay for this one first.
Don't worry. We'll send Farnsworth dough tomorrow.
One, two, three, four, five twenty, forty, sixty, eighty.
- 580.
- Thanks.
If you guys got any more good loads, don't forget I treated you right.
We'll come straight to you.
Come on, I wanna use the phone.
- Give me a flock of change, Leo. - Say, who you calling?
- Cassie.
- Cassie?
Who's that?
That gal we picked up on the road.
I just wanna find out how she's doing.
I thought nothing happened with that dame.
Nothing did.
But I ain't saying nothing won't.
Give me long distance.
Hello. Hello, Joe?
Did something happen to you? You weren't in a...?
No, nothing happened. Nothing bad, anyway.
I was scared when she told me San Francisco was calling.
- I knew it was you or about you.
- How did you know?
Oh, I just knew. Is everything all right?
Everything's great. We got more dough than we ever seen before.
Say this is a funny time to call up a girl, ain't it?
Oh, I don't mind. I'm glad you called. I was worried about you.
Oh, Cassie do you believe in love at first sight?
Well, it saves a lot of time.
- When are you coming back?
- I think I wanna get back and see you as fast as we can buy another load.
- Be careful and don't drive too fast.
I want to see you quick, but all in one piece.
Your three minutes are up. Deposit 50 cents for an additional minute.
Don't spend any more.
When you get back we can talk all you want, and it won't cost a...
Hello?
Hello?
Give me a cup of coffee, Leo.
That was great talk.
Pearl and me used to have them same conversations before we got married.
Who said anything about getting married?
Nobody, but you can't horse me. I know that rash when I see it.
It all depends on how smart the dame is.
Oh, your brakes are dragging. I...
Our rig's moving!
- Hey, where do you think you're going?
- Out of the truck!
- But...
- You, out the other side!
Now, fellas, I'm strictly within my legal rights.
You'd look pretty silly with a monkey wrench out of your head.
- I'll call a policeman!
- If I touch you, you'll call an ambulance.
- How much do we owe you?
- $300 plus $50 interest.
- Sure you ain't gypping yourself?
- Where's that loan paper?
- Right here.
- Mark on it "paid in full" in big letters because that's what you're getting, cash.
One, two, three, twenty, forty, sixty. Here. Give me a 10.
You understand, there's nothing personal.
Yeah, we understand. We love you too. Now get out of here.
- You don't have to be nasty about it.
- We don't have to be, but it's more fun.
What do you say we throw this monkey over the truck?
Well, baby, you're all ours.
- I never thought I'd live to see this day.
- And you're gonna live to see better.
Come on. We just got enough dough left to buy another load.
Hiya, Fabrini. Got that dough you owe me?
- Yeah. I'm gonna pay you in full.
- I congratulate myself.
- What are you hauling?
- Pears.
Oh, fill it up with gas.
Well, I see Paul's asleep again, as usual.
What is it about my brother sleeping that annoys you so much?
You've always got your nose in everybody else's business.
- Come on, fill her up.
- Okay.
If it was me I'd get a little sleep once in a while myself and let him do some driving.
Paul?
- Paul!
- Yeah.
Yeah, what, what's the matter?
Nothing, but you'd better take the wheel for a while.
I'm knocked out.
Where are we, Haig's?
What do you say you and I stop over and grab a couple hours of shuteye?
For the first time in our lives, we get ahead of this racket and he wants to stop and sleep.
- Sure, I wanna sleep.
Everyone sleeps once in a while, remember?
You'd think I wanted to do something peculiar.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
I'm all right.
But my brother's in the truck!
Shoot your lights down there.
Come on. Come on. Hold it.
Paul!
- Paul!
- I'll go and get help.
Paul!
Joe, how is he?
Busted up, but he's gonna be okay.
At first they thought his skull was fractured, but it ain't.
- Where is he?
- Down here.
It was all my fault. He wanted to stop and sleep and I made him drive.
- Don't blame yourself, Joe.
It was bound to happen. I'm grateful he's alive.
- The truck's gone, I suppose.
- Complete wreck.
Load smashed, not a cent of insurance. And we were just starting to do good.
It's always that way, isn't it?
You and Paul will get another truck and be back on the road.
- Wait, Pearl. Before you go in.
- Yes?
Looks like Paul's gonna be out of work for some time.
And I don't want you to worry, see.
While he's getting well, I'll take care of everything.
What are you trying to do, Joe, soften the blow?
- How bad is he?
- Oh, he's all right.
A couple of cuts here and there. All except his right arm.
They thought...
Well, they had to do it.
I'm gonna surprise you. I'm gonna surprise you a lot.
I'm almost glad it happened!
- You're what?
- You heard me, I'm almost glad.
Now he can't drive a truck anymore. Now he'll be home nights.
Now I won't always be alone, worrying.
Maybe it's worth a right arm, Joe.
Maybe it's worth it.
- Hello, sug.
- Don't you ever knock?
Oh, it's all right.
We're married. Don't you remember?
Yeah, how can I forget?
Well, what are you gonna do, open up a shop?
Where's the pole that goes with this?
Oh, to show you how things break in this business you know what happened?
Last night, the Fabrini brothers smacked up, truck and all.
- Was Joe hurt? - No.
He got scratched up a little.
His brother lost a wing.
- What are they gonna do?
- Joe's gonna wheel a truck for me.
He's a good man and I hate to get him that way.
If he's a good man, why are you wasting him on the road?
Where else am I gonna put him?
Anyone with a big back can drive a truck.
Why don't you put him in the garage?
In the garage?
What would he do there?
I don't know. There must be a lot of things.
You're always complaining how tired you are.
Maybe if you had someone to help you you wouldn't always fall asleep after dinner.
You know, sug, that ain't a bad idea of yours.
- Always thinking of the old man, huh?
- Sure I am, Ed.
But you never give me any credit for it.
- Brakes?
Hand brake?
- Check. Check.
- Tires?
Spare tires?
- Check. Check.
- Everything set?
- Fine.
- Okay, Sweeney, let her roll.
- All right, Joe.
Joe!
- Is Ed ready?
- I don't know, Mrs. Carlsen.
- I'll go and see.
- Never mind. He'll be down.
Got a match?
No lighter in this car?
It doesn't work.
Did Ed tell you about our anniversary party tomorrow night?
- I'm sorry, I can't make it.
- But Ed's counting on having you!
- Weren't you, Ed?
- Sure.
- What is it, and how much does it cost?
- Joe says he can't make our party.
Sure you can. It's our new house. I want you to see it.
I gave it to Lana as a surprise, after she picked it out.
I had something planned with Paul tomorrow.
Look here, I'm boss. This is a royal command.
You show up at my new dump tomorrow night. Paul don't pay your salary, I do.
Okay, I'll show up, but I've gotta leave early.
I knew Ed could bring you around. He must have more appeal than I have.
She's terrific.
If you open your mouth, she puts her foot in it.
Here comes work. Good night, Mrs. Carlsen.
See you tomorrow, Ed.
Right on the nose, Irish. They must've taken out the pinball machines.
They're getting tougher.
They got a new one, if you hit a winner it mixes you a drink, tucks you into bed, but nobody ever wins.
- Hi, Irish!
- Hello, Ed.
Funny. She almost never used to call for Ed nights until you started here.
- Or am I talking out of turn?
- Come on, get washed up.
- We're going to Paul's for dinner.
- Again?
It's sure nice since he moved into town.
- Yeah. Pearl's cooking a steak.
- Swell!
Ain't had a steak since breakfast.
Oh, boy, I'm hungry!
- I wonder what they'll have for dessert.
- For you, probably stewed pinballs.
- Hello, baby.
- Hello, Joe.
- That's nice.
- How'd you get here so early?
I got a lift from one of the girls.
- How are you, Irish?
- Hungry.
- Hiya, fellas.
- Hello, Paul.
Hello, Paul. Any luck today?
Yeah, but all bad.
All the old men get the watchman's jobs and that's about the only thing a one-armed guy can do.
There are a lot of jobs you can handle. Hey, Pearl, medium-rare on my steak and not much butter on my potatoes.
Any special design you want on the plate?
- Come on, everybody, sit down.
- You don't have to call me twice.
When I was riding that truck, I used to think I'd never get enough staying home.
- I got enough, all right.
- Relax, you'll find something to do.
Sure. I can always learn to knit, and Ripley'll print my picture.
Have some steak, Cassie, and pass it on.
- How's things going at the store?
- Fine, except I get tired of being on my feet all day.
- I got the same trouble.
The only difference is, I drive all day.
- Beer, Irish?
- That's me, kid.
I'm the best two-fisted beer drinker in America.
Sometimes I get so thirsty, I wish I had three hands.
- Cut it.
- That's okay. He didn't mean no harm.
He's right. Three hands are better than two, ain't they?
- Just like two hands are better than one.
- Take it easy, fella.
Easy?
Yeah, that's a nice word.
Maybe you think it's easy being helpless waiting for Pearl to dress me and feed me sitting around all day, wondering what a guy with no right arm is good for.
Why'd you ever cut me out of that wreck?
This way, she don't even get no life insurance.
- It don't help to get excited.
- It's all well for you, you're in one piece.
You don't have to take nobody's charity like I gotta take yours.
I guess he's been moping around the house too much.
After we eat, we'll go out and have some nightlife.
Maybe that'll cheer him up a little, huh?
- I ain't danced in a long time.
- Me neither, and I used to love it.
It's the most fun you can have without laughing.
Take a lot to get me laughing.
Say, what do you say we get married?
I'd like that fine, but you've got enough responsibilities right now with the hospital bills and Paul out of work.
Yeah, I wish I could find him something.
Why don't you change your mind and ask Ed?
I'd like to, but I can't.
Paul ain't able to do a hard day's work at the garage yet.
Ed's been too swell as it is.
- Guess we gotta just keep on hoping.
- Joe, do me a favor, will you?
Take me dancing again tomorrow night when we both feel better.
Okay.
Oh, I can't. I gotta go to the boss's house to a party.
Don't say "oh" like you think I'm walking out on you.
- I don't wanna go.
- I didn't say you did.
Let's sit down. If we stay here, we'll be fighting.
I'm sorry, kid. I guess I got the jitters tonight.
- Where's Irish?
- He's wandering around all over.
Yeah, he's doing a little hunting.
Looks like he bagged something special.
Hello, folks. This is...
- Say, what's your name?
- Miss Sue Carter.
- Sue Carter.
- Any friend of his is a friend of mine.
- What's your name?
- What's the difference?
Sit down and have a drink. Drinking makes you beautiful.
- I haven't been drinking.
- I know, but I have.
Leave it to Irish to find romance.
Don't she look like a million bucks?
And just as hard to get.
- Wanna come up for a while?
- I don't think so, not tonight.
- I'll make you some coffee.
- I don't want any. It keeps me awake.
Still worried about Paul?
Yeah.
Are you too worried to kiss me?
Not that bad.
- What's the matter, you stop loving me?
- No, darling, but I still have to breathe.
Cassie, you're the only girl in this world I've ever been crazy about.
You're the only fella in the world who could make me believe a lie like that.
Come on. Come up and have some coffee.
No, no coffee.
Yes, sir!
That's what I always tell my drivers.
No phone pole ever hit a truck unless it was in self-defense.
I think the guy that wired this must have baled hay.
There.
Now, get a load... Wait a minute, now.
Ed.
We have servants to open the wine.
What's the fun of having champagne if you can't pop the cork yourself?
Here now, Irish, that ain't beer, so don't start guzzling it.
And you and your truck driver friends stop drinking so much.
This is the only eighth anniversary we're ever gonna have.
Come on, we gotta celebrate.
- Evening, Mrs. Carlsen.
- You're late.
- Oh, I got stuck at the office.
- I'm sorry I forgot to tell you we were dressing.
- Well, I'm not up in that bracket yet.
- Hello, Joe!
- Hello, Ed.
- A glass of champagne?
- No, thanks.
- You know Joe never takes a drink.
- I know.
He's like me. I don't either, unless I got a glass in each hand.
Don't have any bad habits, do you, Joe?
None that I can't handle, Mrs. Carlsen.
Joe, how do you like the dump?
- I think it's swell.
- You wanna know something?
Lana decorated it all by her itty-bitty self.
Early American bargain-basement.
You ain't saw it. You ain't seen it too, Irish.
- Come on, I'Il...
- Ed.
Don't you think Joe ought to meet guests?
What's the use?
He'll only forget their names.
- Culpepper, I sure thirsty.
- Yes, sir.
Charles, bring Mr. Carlsen some water, will you?
Yes, ma'am.
I said thirsty, didn't I?
Not dirty.
If you fall on your face, don't expect me to drag you to bed.
Don't worry about me. If I fall, I'll fall upstairs.
Come on, Joe.
See, Joe, we had all the screens removed because they were fixed so the flies can't get out at all.
- Hey, this leaves me speechless.
- Good. Stay that way.
Well, there you are. Swimming puddle and everything.
Hot, cold running water. Guess I'll have to learn how to swim.
- Well, right this way. - You sure got a nice layout here, Ed.
Someday you'll have one just like it, and a swell wife like Lana to go with it.
- Yeah, that would be nice.
- Yes, sir...
And here we have a badminton court.
A couple of guys chase a feather with fly swatters and the one that don't drop dead wins the game!
Come here.
And, Joe, there's something else I sure want you to get a gander at.
Around a place like this, there's always a lot of confusion about bushes and trees.
Avocados, male and female.
- How can you tell?
- Oh, that's easy.
The bashful one's the girl.
And now for the topper.
You know how you drive up, and you've got to get out and open the doors?
That ain't for me. Get a load of this.
- Say, I'm speechless.
- That's where we came in.
Now you see, all you've got to do is drive or walk between the posts break the ray, and the doors start swinging.
Say, what will they think of inventing next?
I understand some guy's working on a sundial.
Oh, Irish, don't talk silly. Who'd want to dial the sun?
- Good night, Ed. I had a swell time.
- You're going so soon?
I've got to be at the office at 6:30.
Good night, everybody.
- Good night.
- See you in the morning.
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- I certainly am.
- Joe, you're not going.
- Yes, I told you I had to leave early.
Well, I'll walk out with you. I need some air.
It's chilly. Don't you think you'd better go in?
No, it feels good.
- I had a nice time, Mrs. Carlsen.
- Do you have to call me Mrs. Carlsen?
You know, I have a first name.
When I call you Mrs. Carlsen, that keeps me in my place.
Wouldn't be trying to get over it also keeps me in my place?
- That ain't what I said.
- I can read between the lines.
- Joe, what is it?
What's wrong?
- Nothing wrong that I know of.
Then why do you keep acting like this?
Why do you keep pretending you don't even notice me?
Now look, who do you think you're fooling?
I'm not fooling anybody, and that includes you and me both.
Listen, Joe, please.
If I told you once, I told you 50 times, I'm doing good at the office and I'm not playing around with the boss's wife.
Ed's been always all right with me, and I'm never gonna be wrong with him.
How touching.
The faithful employee. The devoted friend.
That's me.
Good night, Mrs. Carlsen.
Mrs. Carlsen.
Mrs.
Mrs.
Listen. Listen, now. Listen.
- Just a little toast.
- A toast.
Early to rise and early to bed makes a man healthy, but socially dead.
Now I'm gonna take you all to the Tango Club.
Tango Club!
Tango Club.
Oh, sugar, listen, will you rush out and leap into that ermine gunnysack?
- We're gonna sneak up on a rumba.
- What's the matter, not enough liquor?
Maybe you'd like to put a still in the basement.
Never at a loss for a comeback.
We're married eight years, and she still tickles me pink.
Shut up, Ed.
You don't want to dance?
She don't care to dance.
I always get a partner.
Oh, well, then you'll do.
- Ed, pay the check.
- No, that's one thing I'm not gonna do.
The liquor is no good. You can't get drunk on it.
Then someone must have hit you over the head with a mallet.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, madam.
Someone help me get him out of here. I'll drive him home.
- You're lucky I stayed sober.
- It certainly does.
Come on. Come on.
- I don't want to dance now.
- Very well.
- Come on, Ed. The air will do you good. - Oh, I don't know.
Who's...?
What's going on here?
Oh, it's a shame, a fine fellow like the boss disgracing himself in public.
Yeah.
Come on. Sit up, you drunken pig.
Let's go in the office and take a little snooze.
Come on, get up and walk, or do I have to carry you?
No, I'm just gonna catch a little snooze.
Needless to say, Mrs. Carlsen, I regret having to go through this formality.
He was so drunk.
I always told him something awful would happen if he kept drinking that way.
Naturally, I couldn't lift such a heavy man out of the car.
He'd stayed in the garage before but he always came in the house when he sobered up.
- This time, he...
- Don't distress yourself, Mrs. Carlsen.
Just take your time.
This time, he must have awakened still drunk and started the car.
Oh, it's awful. He wanted so much to live.
- He had everything to live for.
- Thank you, Mrs. Carlsen.
I regret that I've been forced to question you. I won't bother you further.
- You're very kind.
- Please accept my sincerest sympathy.
Thank you.
The cause of death was accidental, carbon monoxide poisoning.
Close the case.
- Stop creeping around the house.
- I wasn't creeping. Honest, I wasn't.
- I don't want you snooping around.
- I wasn't doing no snooping.
I come in to see if you wanted coffee.
I've had four cups. I don't want any more, you hear?
- Well, do you hear?
! - Yes.
Now get out of my sight, and stop sneaking around!
I don't want you spying on me!
You were supposed to be here at 10:00.
One of our drivers crashed into a load of pipe...
- I don't care about that.
- The driver don't, either. He's dead.
Oh, I'm sorry, Joe. Being alone in this big house gives me the willies.
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.
Oh, that's right. I forgot.
Sit down, Joe.
What was this business you wanted to talk to me about?
Look, Joe, I don't know anything about the company.
I've tried to understand, and the lawyers have explained things to me.
The more they talk, the less I know. I can't run a trucking business by myself.
I've got to have someone to help me.
- Does that mean me?
- Yes. Ed had such confidence in you.
He said you had great ideas. I know he'd want you to be my partner.
- Partner?
- Yes, partner. 50-50.
I've got the papers all drawn up, and all you have to do is...
What's wrong?
Don't you want to own half of the big trucking business?
With anyone else, I'd think it was a swell deal, but you...
- I don't know.
- Why not, Joe?
It's good for me because if I don't get help, I'll lose the business.
It's good for you because you'll never get this chance again.
- No interference?
- None. I promise you, Joe.
I don't know anything about trucks. How could I interfere?
- I wasn't talking about trucks.
- Oh, you've got to help me, Joe.
I haven't anyone else in the world to turn to.
Well, what's it gonna be?
If it's gonna be like you say, you can count me in.
Oh, I'm so glad, Joe. Neither of us will regret it.
Now, how about that drink to celebrate, just this once?
- Okay. I'll take a short one.
- It's gonna work out fine, Joe.
I know it will. And it's what Ed would have wanted.
Maybe you're right.
Well here's to our partnership. May it be a long and happy one.
It could work out pretty good.
I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll figure out new lines, buy new trucks.
We'll get business we never even thought about. We'll go a long way.
Yes, we will.
- Hey, Joe, who sneaked those rigs in?
- New refrigerator jobs.
Opens up a lot of dairy business for us.
I don't know where I'm gonna get 20 drivers to wheel them.
- Is Bill McGowan a good driver?
- I don't want to say anything bad but when the road turns the same time he does, it's just a coincidence.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
- What's the trouble?
- Got to clean and adjust the points.
- How long will it take?
- About 15 minutes.
Hello, Joe.
How are you?
- These the new trucks? - Yeah.
I see you got a new buggy.
- Blowing all the profits?
- We're making a lot of profits to blow.
Why not?
Say, that's a snappy outfit.
You like it?
I didn't think you'd notice.
It isn't too soon for me to stop wearing black, is it?
- No, I don't think so.
- That's the way I felt.
Take a good look. You're not gonna see me in the same outfit twice for months.
Pardon me.
Hello, Cassie.
Come on, I want you to meet Mrs. Carlsen.
- Mrs. Carlsen, this is Cassie Hartley. - I'm glad to know you.
- If you're talking business, I'll wait. - Oh, no.
- Cassie and I were going to get dinner.
- Would you care to come along?
No.
- No, thank you.
- Joe.
What's the matter?
Get some water.
- We'll take her to a doctor.
- Take me home.
- Don't you think it...?
- I said, take me home!
Hop in, Cassie.
- I'll run it in the garage for you.
- No, stop. Stop it, do you hear?
- What's the matter with you?
- Please, let me out. Please, let me out!
- Would you like me to come in?
- Leave me alone.
Hi, boss.
Here are those federal gas papers. They look all right.
Fine, George. I'll go over them.
Mrs. Carlsen's been here while you were out to dinner.
I don't know, she may be here yet.
Okay.
- Hello, Joe.
- Oh, hello.
We may knock over that federal gas contract.
That's swell.
- How do you feel tonight?
- Oh, much better.
Oh, that's good.
Sorry about yesterday, Joe. I guess my nerves just gave out.
You ought to go away for a while, get a change.
You've been hanging around that house too much.
Maybe I will.
Your friend Miss Hartley, she's very nice.
- Known her long?
- Quite a while.
Did you have a nice time after you left me?
It was all right.
You must apologize to Miss Hartley for me.
Oh, she didn't think anything of it.
- How about some dinner, Joe?
- I've had mine.
You could sit with me and have a drink. Maybe we could dance.
I'd like to, but I've got to get some estimates. Figures on the new trucks.
I know, but you can do all that tomorrow morning.
I've got a lot of other things to do in the morning, and this is important.
It's the only time I have to do it.
I'm sorry, Joe.
I guess I'm a fine partner, trying to pull you away from your work.
The Frank Conners are throwing a party Friday night.
They asked me to bring you along.
Sorry, I can't make it.
"Can't make it. Can't make it". That's all I ever hear from you.
It used to be because my husband was your friend. Well, he's dead.
He's been dead for six months. What's wrong with me now?
Why can't you make it?
I'm getting married Friday. Is that a good enough reason?
Married?
To that redhead?
To that redhead.
What made you think you had to marry her?
I just thought it was a good idea. Any objections?
Yeah, I got objections. What makes you think you can make a sucker out of me?
- You better relax.
- Don't tell me to relax, you road slob.
If it weren't for me, you'd still be kicking trucks up the coast.
I get Ed to take you off the road.
I put that clean collar around your dirty neck.
I put those creases in your pants. I put that money in your pocket.
What makes you think you can walk out on me?
I came in here on a business deal, and I've done all right for you.
Don't talk like a fool.
I walked you right into a company that was set and established.
I gave you Ed's insurance money to buy new trucks.
I could have picked anyone off the street and they'd have done as well.
Anytime you don't like the setup, I can check out.
You're not getting out.
You belong with me, and you're gonna stay.
If you don't like it, you'll learn to.
Only you're not going off marrying that cheap redhead.
I'm marrying cassie, and I'm not asking anybody what they think.
That includes you.
She hasn't any right to you. You're mine, and I'm hanging on to you.
I committed murder to get you.
Understand?
Murder.
- You what?
- Sure. I killed Ed.
I killed him to get you because you always threw him in my face.
"Yes, Mrs. Carlsen. No, Mrs. Carlsen.
No, Mrs. Carlsen. Good night, Mrs. Carlsen".
You made me do it. You, understand?
I didn't want to kill anyone, but you made me murder Ed, your friend.
Joe!
Joe, where are you going?
I'm getting out of here, and stay away from me.
Oh, Joe, don't go. Forget what I said. I didn't mean what I said.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
- I didn't kill Ed. It was just an accident.
- Save that record for someone else.
- You may need it.
- Oh, listen, Joe. I'll be a good sport.
Marry her, and I hope you're happy with her, only please don't leave me.
Please come back.
I didn't want to kill anyone. I didn't.
I didn't want to kill anyone.
He made me do it.
Yes.
He made me kill him.
He made me kill him. He said he'd kill me if I didn't.
I didn't want to do it, but I was afraid of him.
I had to. Joe wanted the insurance money.
He wanted everything for himself. He made me do it.
Just a moment.
Have Joe Fabrini of Carlsen Trucking picked up, and you come in here.
In other words, when you were in this office the morning after your husband's death, your statement was a lie.
Yes, but I didn't want to lie. I was afraid to tell the truth then.
- Now I'm not afraid anymore.
- I see.
The truth is that you were coerced into murdering your husband by Fabrini.
Yes, yes, that's it.
That's it.
- He made me kill him.
- Sit down.
I'm going to dictate for your signature the confession you've just made to me.
Correct me if I'm wrong. "I, Lana Carlsen..."
She never thought I'd see her.
I'll bet she was surprised when they told her I would.
I'll see her, all right. I've got things to tell her.
- All right, tell her, not me.
- Just wait till I see her. Just wait.
- What's the matter with you?
- That door it opened.
- Of course it did. We broke the ray.
It's an electric eye door. Come on.
No, I won't go through it. I won't go through it, I tell you.
- I won't, I tell you.
- Stop it.
No, I won't. No, please. Please don't make me.
I thought you'd show up.
Now that you're here, what do you want?
I want you to tell the truth.
What do you think the truth is?
Joe had nothing to do with killing your husband, and nothing to do with you.
Is that so?
What do you think he was doing those nights he was working in the garage?
Do you think he was in the garage at all?
Why do you think I took him into the business?
Why did I give him my husband's insurance money to play with?
Because he had an honest face?
You could talk from now on, but you'd never make me believe that Joe ever laid a hand on anyone like you.
- What makes you so sure of that?
- I love him. I know.
You love him.
You don't know what it is to love a man, but I do.
And I'll take him with me wherever I'm going.
You're worse than I thought anyone could be.
Why don't you tell them what really happened?
Joe wouldn't have anything to do with you.
You killed your husband because you thought he was in the way.
You threw yourself at Joe, but he wouldn't look at you because he had you pegged from the beginning.
Tell them you found out he was going to marry me and you decided to stop it, even if it meant double-crossing yourself.
You've got it all worked out, haven't you?
But you've got it worked out wrong, all wrong.
Because I'm the one who...
Stop that door.
Stop it, I tell you. Stop that door!
- Stop it!
Stop it!
- Come on. Come on, your time's up.
No, I won't go through that door!
I won't!
You can't make me!
- Come on, come on.
- I won't!
No, I won't!
I won't, I tell you!
I won't!
I won't!
I won't!
- What's the dame hitting high c for?
- Maybe she don't like the service here.
I don't know why these things always got to bust at lunchtime.
This one's all right. Close her up.
So, Your Honor, and ladies and gentlemen of the jury the prosecution will prove that Joe Fabrini by means of duress and threats, employed the wife of the murdered man as ruthlessly as ever a man employed a dagger or gun, to commit for profit a cold-blooded, brutal, preconceived murder.
With your permission, I will call the first witness, Miss Sue Carter.
Is it true you attended a party at the Carlsen home the night of Mr. Carlsen's death?
Yes, Your Honor.
The judge is the only person in this courtroom to be addressed as "Your Honor".
- How do you do?
- Now, at this party during the evening did you see Mr. Fabrini and Mrs. Carlsen in private conversation?
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Miss Carter, I am asking the questions.
Now, where did this conversation take place?
Well, I just happened to be in the powder room powdering my nose, of course, and I looked out the window and I saw Mr. Fabrini and Mrs. Carlsen standing by the side of his car arguing.
- Did you hear what they were saying?
- Well, I didn't exactly hear.
You understand, I didn't try, but it seemed to me that one of them wanted the other one to do something but I couldn't tell who wanted who to do what to which.
When your brother became head of the Carlsen Trucking service did you get a job as traffic manager with the company?
- Yeah, but...
- Objection. The question is leading.
- Objection sustained.
- That's all.
Miss Hartley, you say that you and Mr. Fabrini have been in love, plan to be married.
- That's right.
- Can you tell me why you didn't get married some time ago?
- We couldn't afford it.
- Did Fabrini work evenings quite a bit?
- Yes.
- Could you swear that Mr. Fabrini was actually in his office working on those evenings?
- No, but I...
- Isn't it possible that Mr. Fabrini didn't marry because he found marriage inconvenient in his relations with Mrs. Carlsen?
- Objection.
Objection sustained.
The witness will not have to answer that.
Isn't it true that Mr. Fabrini kept you two ladies apart until one evening, when he got his dates crossed he found you both face to face?
- Well, Joe never did...
- I object!
- Overruled.
- Isn't it true that Mrs. Carlsen was so unnerved that she fainted?
- She was ill.
- Certainly, she was ill. Ill of shock.
Shocked at finding the man for whom she murdered her own husband with another woman.
That's not right. Joe didn't help in any murder.
He didn't have anything to do with it. If he thought...
That's all.
Did you say anything to Mr. Fabrini about Mrs. Carlsen?
I don't remember.
Did you ever notice that after Fabrini came to work at Carlsen's that Mrs. Carlsen frequented the garage more than she had previously?
- I don't remember.
- Don't you remember anything?
- Why don't you remember?
- Maybe it's because I got a bad memory.
Now, Your Honor and ladies and gentlemen of the jury I call to the stand Mrs. Lana Carlsen.
Stand up, please.
Do you swear to tell the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Take the chair.
State your name.
- Lana Carlsen.
- You will speak up, please.
You were, at the time of his death, the wife of Edward Carlsen?
Yes.
How long before the death of Carlsen were you acquainted with Joe Fabrini?
Two years.
Where did you first meet him?
Mrs. Carlsen, I asked you where you first met Fabrini.
You will answer the question, please.
He was laughing.
Yes, he... He was laughing.
He kissed me when he was drunk.
Yes, he kissed me when he was drunk.
So I got a new car.
Yes, I got a new car.
And I bought some new clothes.
Yes, they were pretty.
And he used to tell terrible jokes.
And he'd laugh at them.
He was always laughing.
And then I saw him lying there drunk.
I heard the motor running.
And I saw the doors.
I heard the motor.
I saw the doors.
The doors made me do it.
Yes.
The doors made me do it.
The doors made me do it.
- Matron, remove the witness.
- They made me do it!
They made me do it!
The doors!
They made me do it!
The doors!
The doors made me do it!
Your Honor!
Your Honor, I move that this case be dismissed on the ground that the sole witness to the alleged crime is obviously insane.
Court is adjourned while the state's alienist examine Mrs. Carlsen.
Everybody rise.
- City desk and hurry.
- Give me the desk.
Hello, Ed. Here it is. The doctors all say she's daffy.
Yeah, nuts. They had to take her away in a straitjacket.
Yeah, that's right. Case thrown out of court. Fabrini goes free.
Sounds funny, I suppose, but I can't help feeling sorry for that dame.
Me too, in a way.
- What about the business, Joe?
- What about it?
It's like I told you.
I'm giving my share to the boys.
After what's happened, I need a change of scenery.
What about us?
We're getting married just like we figured.
I'll dig up a new truck and hit the road again.
Why, I'll be on top in no time. I can't miss with...
Say, you're not gonna tell me I'm not right, are you?
No, Joe.
Of course, I hate to see you go back to the road but if that's the way you want it I'm with you around every curve.
Well, my mind's made up.
Gee, I promised to phone the store. Do you mind stopping while I call?
All right.
I'll only be a minute.
- Hello, Irish. This is Cassie.
- Hello, cassie. What's on your mind?
Joe's on his way to tell you he's giving up the business.
Have the guys shout him down, I'll do the rest.
Okay, kid. Leave it to me.
My mind's made up too.
So it's like I tell you, fellas.
I don't feel I got the right to stay on here so I'm giving you my share, and I'm bowing out.
No!
- Slow down, will you?
- You're on a dead-end street, Joe.
That's right, Joe. These boys want no part of an executive business.
Paul here can handle things as good as anybody.
Oh, no, not me. I got too many other problems.
- We're gonna have a baby.
- Congratulations. Say, does Pearl know?
- Say, that's good news, Paul.
- You can give us some good news.
Say you're staying on as the head guy.
Fellas, I'm sure glad you feel this way, but I...
Well, I...
- What do you think, Cassie?
- Your mind's made up, Joe.
But there's a lot of angles here.
Somebody's got to take care of those accounts.
- I may get that gas contract.
- I wouldn't try to influence you any more than I would the boys, Joe, but the way you're talking maybe you'd better stay.
Okay, fellas, I'm sticking with you.
News on the March.
Legendary was the Xanadu where Kubla Khan decreed his stately pleasure dome.
Today almost as legendary as Florida's Xanadu the world's largest private pleasure ground.
Here on the deserts of the Gulf Coast, a private mountain was commissioned and successfully built.
One hundred thousand trees, twenty thousand tons of marble are the ingredients of Xanadu's mountain.
Contents of Xanadu's palace:
Paintings, pictures, statues, various stones of other palaces.
A collection of everything.
So big it can never be catalogued or appraised.
Enough for 10 museums, the loot of the world.
Xanadu's livestock the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea, the beast of the field and jungle two of each, the biggest private zoo since Noah.
Like the Pharaohs Xanadu's landlord leaves many stones to mark his grave.
Since the Pyramids Xanadu is the costliest monument a man has built to himself.
Here in Xanadu last week Xanadu's landlord was laid to rest.
A potent figure of our century America's Kubla Khan:
Charles Foster Kane.
Its humble beginnings, in this ramshackle building, a dying daily.
Kane's empire, in its glory held dominion over 37 newspapers, two syndicates a radio network, an empire upon an empire.
The first of grocery stores, paper mills apartment buildings, factories, forests, ocean liners.
An empire through which for 50 years flowed in an unending stream the wealth of the Earth's third richest gold mine.
Famed in American legend is the origin of the Kane fortune.
How, to boarding housekeeper Mary Kane, by a defaulting boarder, in 1868 was left the supposedly worthless deed to an abandoned mineshaft:
The Colorado Lode.
Fifty seven years later, before a congressional investigation  Walter P. Thatcher, grand old man of Wall Street for years chief target of Kane papers' attacks on trusts recalls a journey he made as a youth.
My firm had been appointed trustee by Mrs. Kane for a large fortune she recently acquired.
It was her wish that I take charge of this boy, Charles Foster Kane.
Chief, is it not, that on this occasion, Charles Foster Kane personally attacked you after striking you in the stomach with a sled?
I shall read to the committee a prepared statement which I have brought with me, and then refuse to answer questions.
Mr. Charles Foster Kane, in every essence of his social beliefs and by the dangerous manner he has persistently attacked American traditions of private property initiative and opportunity for advancement is, in fact, nothing more or less than a communist.
That same month in Union Square....
The words "Charles Foster Kane" are a menace to every workingman in this land.
He is today what he has always been and always will be: a fascist.
And still another opinion....
Kane urged his country's entry into one war opposed participation in another.
Won the election to one American president at least.
Spoke for millions of Americans. Was hated by as many more.
For 40 years appeared in Kane newsprint no public issue on which Kane papers took no stand.
No public man whom Kane himself did not support or denounce.
Often support, then denounce.
Twice married, twice divorced.
First to a president's niece Emily Norton, who left him in 1916.
Died 1918 in a motor accident with their son.
Sixteen years after his first marriage two weeks after his first divorce Kane married Susan Alexander singer, at the Town Hall in Trenton, New Jersey.
For wife two, one time opera singing Susan Alexander Kane built Chicago's Municipal Opera House.
Cost: $3 million.
Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane, half finished before she divorced him the still unfinished Xanadu.
No man can say.
Kane, molder of mass opinion though he was in all his life was never granted elective office by the voters of his country.
But Kane papers were once strong indeed and once the prize seemed almost his.
In 1916, as independent candidate for governor the best elements of the state behind him the White House seemingly the next easy step in a lightning political career then suddenly, less than one week before election defeat.
Shameful, ignominious.
Defeat that set back for 20 years the cause of reform in the U.S forever cancelled political chances for Charles Foster Kane.
Then, in the first year of the Great Depression a Kane paper closes.
For Kane, in four short years, collapse.
Eleven Kane papers merged, more sold, scrapped.
Don't believe everything you hear on the radio.
Read the Inquirer.
How were business conditions in Europe?
How did I find business conditions in Europe, Mr. Bones?
With great difficulty.
Are you glad to be back?
I'm always glad to be back. I'm an American. Always been an American.
Anything else?
When I was a reporter, we asked them quicker than that.
What do you think of the chances for war in Europe?
I talked with the responsible leaders of England, France, Germany and Italy.
They're too intelligent to embark on a project that would mean the end of civilization.
You can take my word for it, there will be no war.
Kane helped to change the world but Kane's world now is history and the great yellow journalist himself lived to be history outlived his power to make it.
Alone in his never finished, already decaying pleasure palace aloof, seldom visited, never photographed an emperor of newsprint continued to direct his failing empire.
Vainly attempted to sway, as he once did the destinies of a nation that had ceased to listen to him ceased to trust him.
Then last week, as it must to all men death came to Charles Foster Kane.
News on the March.
Stand by. I'll tell you if we want to run it again. How about it, Mr. Rawlston?
How do you like it, boys? Seventy years in a man's life.
That's a lot to try to get into a newsreel.
It's a good short, but what it needs is an angle.
All we saw on that screen was that Charles Foster Kane is dead.
I know that. I read the papers.
It isn't enough to tell us what a man did you've got to tell us who he was.
Wait a minute.
What were Kane's last words?
Do you remember, boys?
What were the last words he said on Earth?
Maybe he told us about himself on his deathbed. Maybe he didn't.
All we saw was a big American.
How did he differ from Ford, Hearst or John Doe?
I tell you, a man's dying words
What were they?
You don't read the papers.
When Charles Foster Kane died, he said one word:
"Rosebud."
That's all he said? Tough guy.
Yes, "Rosebud." Just that one word. But who is she? What was it?
Here's a man who could've been president who was as loved, hated and talked about as any man in our time, but when he dies something is on his mind called Rosebud.
What does that mean?
A racehorse he bet on once.
That didn't come in. But what was the race? Rosebud.
Thompson. Yes.
Hold this up a week, two if you must.
Don't you think right after he's dead
Get in touch with anybody who knew him or knew him well. Find out about Rosebud.
That manager of his....
Bernstein. His second wife.
She's still living.
Susan Alexander Kane.
She runs a nightclub in Atlantic City.
That's right. Get in touch with everybody that ever worked for him whoever loved him, whoever hated his guts.
I don't mean go through the city directory of course.
I'll get on it right away. Good.
Rosebud, dead or alive.
It will probably turn out to be a very simple thing.
Miss Alexander. This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander.
I want another drink, John.
Right away.
Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
I'll have a highball, please.
Who told you you could sit down? I thought maybe we could have a talk.
Think again.
Can't you people leave me alone?
I'm minding my own business, you mind yours.
If I could just have a talk with you, Miss Alexander. I'd
Get out of here. Get out!
Sorry.
Get out.
Maybe some other time.
Get out.
Get her another highball.
She just won't talk to nobody, Mr. Thompson.
Okay. Another double?
Yeah.
Hello, I want New York City.
Courtland 79970. This is Atlantic City 46827.
All right.
She's....
She'll snap out of it.
Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as any Hello.
Sooner. This is Thompson. Let me talk to the chief.
She won't talk.
The second Mrs. Kane.
About Rosebud or anything else. I'm calling from Atlantic City.
Tomorrow I'll go to Philadelphia, to Thatcher Library, to see his diary.
They're expecting me.
Then I've a meeting with his general manager in New York.
Bernstein.
Then I'm coming back here.
Yeah, I'll see everybody that's still alive.
Goodbye. Hey.... John.
You just might be able to help me.
When she used to talk about Mr. Kane, did she ever mention Rosebud?
"Rosebud"?
Thank you, Mr. Thompson, thanks.
As a matter of fact, just the other day, when the papers were full of it I asked her.
She never heard of Rosebud.
The directors of the Thatcher Memorial Library have asked me to remind you about the conditions under which you may inspect certain portions of Mr. Thatcher's unpublished memoirs.
I remember them. Yes, Jennings, I'll bring him in.
All I want is an hour Under no circumstances are direct quotes from his manuscript to be used by you.
You may follow me. That's all right. I'm just looking for
Jennings.
Thank you, Jennings.
You will be required to leave this room at 4:30 promptly.
You will confine yourself, it is our understanding to the chapters in Mr. Thatcher's manuscript regarding Mr. Kane.
That's all I'm interested in. Thank you.
Pages 83 to 142.
Come on, boys.
Be careful, Charles. Mrs. Kane.
Pull your muffler around your neck, Charles. Mrs. Kane, I think we'll have to tell him now.
Yes, I'll sign those papers now, Mr. Thatcher.
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher.
There's nothing wrong with Colorado.
I don't see why we can't raise our son just 'cause we came into money.
If I want to, I can go to court.
A father has a right to.
A boarder that beats his bill and leaves worthless stock behind....
That property is as much my property as anybody's now that it's valuable.
And if Fred Graves had any idea this would happen, he'd have made out the certificates in both our names.
But they're made out to Mrs. Kane.
He owed the money to both of us.
"The bank's decision in all matters " I don't hold with giving Charles to a bank
Stop this nonsense.
We're a bit uneducated "The bank's decision concerning his education...
"...his places of residence, is to be final."
The idea of a bank being the guardian Stop this nonsense, Jim.
"We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode" which I repeat, Mrs. Kane, you are the sole owner.
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher? Right here.
Mary, I'm asking you for the last time.
You'd think I hadn't been a good husband or father
The sum of $50,000 a year is to be paid to you and Mr. Kane as long as you both live and thereafter to the survivor.
Let's hope it's all for the best.
It is.
Why I can't raise my own boy is more than I can understand.
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.
Everything else, the principal, as well as all monies earned is to be administered by the bank in trust for your son, Charles Foster Kane until he reaches his 25th birthday, at which time he is to come into complete possession.
Charles!
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.
It's almost 5:00.
Don't you think I'd better meet the boy?
I've got his trunk all packed. I've had it packed for a week now.
I've arranged for a tutor to meet us in Chicago.
I'd have brought him here with me, but.... Charles.
Look, Mom.
You'd better come inside.
That's quite a snowman. I took the pipe out of his mouth.
Did you make it yourself?
Maybe I'll make some teeth and whiskers.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles. Hello.
How do you do, Charles?
He comes from the East.
Hello, Charlie. Charles. Yes, Mommy.
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight.
You'll be leaving on number 10. That's the train with all the lights on it.
You going, Mom? No.
Your mother won't be going right away, but she'll.... Where am I going?
You're going to see Chicago and New York and Washington, maybe.
Ain't he?
He certainly is.
I wish I were a boy going on a trip like that for the first time.
Why aren't you coming with us, Mom?
We have to stay here, Charles.
You're gonna live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie.
You're gonna be rich.
Your ma figures, well, that is me and her decided this ain't the place for you to grow up in.
You'll probably be the richest man someday and you ought to get You won't be lonely.
Lonely, of course not. We're going to have fine times together, we are.
Let's shake hands.
Come. I'm not that frightening, am I? What do you say?
Let's shake.
Why, Charles. Why, you almost hurt me.
Charlie! Sleds aren't to hit people, but to sleigh with.
Mom!
I'm sorry, Mr. Thatcher.
What the kid needs is a good thrashing.
That's what you think, is it? Yes.
That's why he's going to be brought up where you can't get at him.
Well, Charles Merry Christmas.
In closing may I remind you your 25th birthday, which is now approaching marks your complete independence from the firm of Thatcher  Company, as well as acquiring the full responsibility for the world's sixth largest private fortune.
Got that? "The world's sixth largest private fortune."
I don't think you realize the full importance of the position you are to occupy.
I am therefore enclosing for your consideration a list of your holdings, extensively cross indexed.
"Dear Mr. Thatcher." It's from Mr. Kane.
Go on. "Sorry, I'm not interested in gold mines...
"...oil wells, shipping or real estate."
Not interested?
"One item on your list intrigues me: The New York Inquirer.
"A little newspaper we acquired in a foreclosure proceeding.
"Don't sell it.
I am coming back to take charge.
"I think it would be fun to run a newspaper.
"Traction Trust exposed."
"Traction Trust bleeds public white."
"Traction Trust smashed by Inquirer."
"Landlords refuse to clear slums."
"Inquirer wins slum fight."
"Wall Street backs copper swindle."
"Copper robbers indicted."
"Galleons of Spain off Jersey Coast."
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
I don't know how to run a newspaper.
I try everything I can think of.
You know there's not the slightest proof this Armada's off the Jersey Coast.
Hello, Mr. Bernstein.
Can you prove it isn't?
Mr. Bernstein, I'd like you to meet Mr. Thatcher.
Mr. Leland. Hello.
Mr. Thatcher, my ex guardian.
We have no secrets from our readers.
Thatcher is one of our devoted readers.
He knows what's wrong with every copy of the Inquirer since I took over.
"Girls delightful in Cuba. Stop. Could send you prose poems...
"...about scenery but don't feel right spending your money.
"There is no war in Cuba." Signed "Wheeler." Any answer?
Yes.
Dear Wheeler:
You provide the prose poems, I'll provide the war.
That's fine. I like it myself. Send it right away.
I came to see you about this campaign of yours.
The Inquirer's campaign against the Public Transit Company.
Do you know anything we can use against them?
You're still the college boy, eh?
I was expelled from college, a lot of colleges, you remember?
I think I should remind you of a fact you have forgotten.
You're one of the largest stockholders in the Public Transit Company.
The trouble is, you don't realize you're talking to two people.
As Charles Foster Kane who owns 82,364 shares of Public Transit Preferred.
See, I do have a general idea of my holdings.
I sympathize with you.
Kane is a scoundrel his paper should be closed, a committee formed to boycott him.
If you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of $1,000.
On the other hand, I am the publisher of the Inquirer.
As such it's my duty, I'll let you in on a little secret.
It is also my pleasure to see that the working people of this community aren't robbed by a pack of money mad pirates, just because they have no one to look after their interests.
I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher:
I think I'm the man to do it. You see, I have money and property.
If I don't look after the interests of the underprivileged, somebody else will.
Maybe somebody without money or property.
That would be too bad.
I saw your financial statement today.
Oh, did you?
Tell me, honestly don't you think it's rather unwise to continue this philanthropic enterprise this Inquirer, that is costing you $1 million a year?
I did lose $1 million last year.
I expect to lose $1 million this year.
I expect to lose $1 million next year.
At the rate of $1 million a year I'll have to close this place in 60 years.
"With respect to the said newspapers...
"...the said Charles Foster Kane...
"...hereby relinquishes all control thereof...
"...and of the syndicates pertaining thereto...
"...and any and all other newspaper, press and publishing properties of any kind...
"...and agrees to abandon all claim thereto "
Which means we're bust all right. Well, out of cash.
All right, Mr. Bernstein.
I've read it, Mr. Thatcher, just let me sign it and go home.
You're too old to call me Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
You're too old to be called anything else.
You were always too old.
"In consideration thereof, Thatcher  Company agrees...
"...to pay to Charles Foster Kane, as long as he lives "
My allowance.
"You will continue to maintain over your newspapers a large...
"...measure of control.
Measure of control."
And we shall seek your advice.
This depression is temporary.
There's always the chance that you'll die richer than I will.
It's a cinch I'll die richer than I was born.
We never lost as much as we made.
Yes, yes, but your methods.
You know, Charles you never made a single investment.
You always used money to....
To buy things.
To buy things.
My mother should have chosen a less reliable banker.
I always gagged on that silver spoon.
You know, Mr. Bernstein if I hadn't been very rich I might have been a really great man.
Don't you think you are?
I think I did pretty well under the circumstances.
What would you like to have been?
Everything you hate.
I beg your pardon, sir?
What did you say?
It's 4:30. Isn't it, Jennings?
Yes, ma'am.
You have enjoyed a very rare privilege, young man.
Did you find what you were looking for?
No.
You're not Rosebud, are you? What?
Rosebud, and your name is Jennings, isn't it?
Goodbye, everybody. Thanks for the use of the hall.
Who's a busy man, me? I'm chairman of the board.
I got nothing but time. What do you want to know?
We thought maybe....
If we could find out what he meant by his last words as he was dying.
That "Rosebud"?
Maybe some girl?
There were a lot of them in the early days.
It's hardly likely that Mr. Kane could have met someone casually and then 50 years later, on his deathbed
Well, you're pretty young, Mr. Thompson.
A fellow will remember a lot of things you wouldn't think he'd remember.
You take me.
One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in and on it there was a girl waiting to get off.
A white dress she had on.
She was carrying a white parasol.
I only saw her for one second.
She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.
Who else have you been to see? Well, I went down to Atlantic City.
Susie?
Thank you.
I called her myself the day after he died.
I thought maybe somebody ought to. She couldn't even come to the phone.
I'll be seeing her again in a couple of days.
About Rosebud, Mr. Bernstein.
If you'd talk about anything connected with Mr. Kane that you can remember.
You were with him from the beginning.
From before the beginning, young fellow.
And now it's after the end.
Have you tried to see anybody except Susie?
I haven't seen anybody else, but I've been through Walter Thatcher's journal.
That man was the biggest fool I ever met.
He made an awful lot of money.
Well, it's no trick to make a lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.
You take Mr. Kane.
It wasn't money he wanted.
Thatcher never did figure him out.
Sometimes even I couldn't.
You know who you ought to see?
Mr. Leland.
He was Mr. Kane's closest friend. They went to school together.
Harvard?
Oh, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell, Switzerland.
He was thrown out of a lot of colleges.
Mr. Leland never had a nickel.
One of those families where the father is worth $10 million then one day he shoots himself, and it turns out there's nothing but debts.
He was with Mr. Kane and me the first day Mr. Kane took over the Inquirer.
Take a good look at it, Jedediah.
It's going to look a lot different one of these days.
Come on.
There ain't no bedrooms in this joint. That's a newspaper building.
You're getting paid, mister, for opinions or for hauling?
Jedediah.
After you, Mr. Kane.
Excuse me, sir, but I....
Welcome, Mr. Kane.
Welcome to the Inquirer, Mr. Kane.
I am Herbert Carter, the editor in chief.
Thank you, Mr. Carter.
This is Mr. Leland How do you do, Mr. Leland?
Our new dramatic critic.
I hope I haven't made a mistake.
It is dramatic critic, right?
That's right.
Are they standing for me?
You?
Oh, Mr. Kane. Standing?
How do you do? How do you do?
I thought it would be a nice little gesture.
Ask them to sit down, will you, please.
The new publisher.
You may resume your duties, gentlemen. Thank you.
I didn't know your plans.
I don't know my plans myself.
Matter of fact, I haven't got any plans.
Except to get out a newspaper.
Mr. Bernstein. Yes, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.
Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
How do you do, Mr. Carter?
Mr. Carter. How do you do?
Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
Stein. Kane.
Mr. Carter, is this your office?
My little private sanctum is at your disposal.
Excuse me. But I don't think I understand.
Mr. Carter, I'm going to live right here in your office as long as I have to.
Live here?
Yes?
Excuse me.
But a morning newspaper, after all
We're practically closed for 12 hours a day.
That's one of the things that's going to have to be changed here.
The news goes on for 24 hours a day. 24?
That's right.
Excuse me.
It's impossible....
I've drawn that cartoon.
I'm no good as a cartoonist.
You certainly aren't.
You're the dramatic critic, Leland.
You still eating? I'm still hungry.
Here's a front page story in the Chronicle about a Mrs. Harry Silverstone in Brooklyn who's missing.
She's probably murdered.
Why isn't there something about it in the Inquirer?
We're running a newspaper...
I'm absolutely starving to death. ...not a scandal sheet.
That's all right.
Mr. Carter, here is a three column headline in the Chronicle.
Why hasn't the Inquirer a three column headline?
The news wasn't big enough.
Mr. Carter, if the headline is big enough, it makes the news big enough.
The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone
There's no proof that she was murdered, or dead. It says she's missing.
The neighbors are getting suspicious.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.
If we were interested in that kind of thing, we could fill the paper twice over, daily.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on.
I want you to send your best man to see Mr. Silverstone.
Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife, Mrs. Silverstone the Inquirer will have him arrested.
Tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from....
Central Office. The Central Office.
If Mr. Silverstone gets suspicious and asks to see your man's badge your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist.
Loudly, so the neighbors can hear.
You ready for dinner, Jedediah?
I can't see that the function of a respectable newspaper
Thank you so much, Mr. Carter. Goodbye. Goodbye.
Paper!
Read all about it!
Read all about it in the early morning Chronicle.
The mystery of the lady that vanished in Brooklyn.
Read all about it in the early morning Chronicle.
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie, another 10 minutes.
Three hours and 50 minutes late, but we did it.
Tired? A tough day.
A wasted day. Wasted?
You only made the paper over four times tonight, that's all.
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.
That's not enough.
There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print.
I've got to make the New York Inquirer as important to New York as the gas in that light.
What are you going to do, Charlie?
My Declaration of Principles.
Don't smile, Jedediah.
I've got it all written out here.
You don't want to make any promises you don't want to keep.
These'll be kept.
"I'll provide the people of this city...
"...with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.
"I will also provide " That's two sentences starting with "I."
People will know who's responsible and they'll get the truth in the Inquirer, quickly, simply and entertainingly.
No special interests will be allowed to interfere with that truth.
"I will also provide them with a fighting and tireless champion of their rights...
"...as citizens and as human beings."
Signed:
"Charles Foster Kane."
Can I have that, Charlie?
I'm going to print it.
Solly! Yes, Mr. Kane?
I want you to run this editorial in a box on the front page.
This morning's front page?
That's right, Solly, that means we'll have to remake again. Yes.
Go down and tell them. All right.
When you're through with that, I'd like to have it back.
I'd like to keep that particular piece of paper myself.
I have a hunch it might turn out to be something pretty important.
A document... Sure.
...like the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and my first report card at school.
I know you're tired, gentlemen, but I brought you here for a reason.
This little pilgrimage will do us good.
The Chronicle's a good newspaper. Chronicle's a good idea for a newspaper.
Notice the circulation.
495,000.
But look who's working for the Chronicle.
With them, it's no trick to get circulation.
You're right.
You know how long it took the Chronicle to get that staff together? Twenty years.
Twenty years?
Six years ago, I looked at a picture of the world's greatest newspaper men.
I felt like a kid in front of a candy store.
Tonight, six years later, I got my candy, all of it.
Welcome, gentlemen, to the Inquirer.
Make an extra copy of that picture and mail it to the Chronicle.
It'll make you all happy to learn that our circulation this morning was the greatest in New York: 684,000.
684,132.
Right.
I hope you'll forgive my rudeness in taking leave of you.
I'm going abroad next week for a vacation.
I've promised my doctor for sometime that I would leave when I could.
I now realize I can't.
Say, Mr. Kane, as long as you're promising there's a lot of pictures and statues in Europe you ain't bought yet.
You can't blame me, Mr. Bernstein.
They've been making statues for 2,000 years.
And I've only been buying for five.
Promise me, Mr. Kane.
I promise, Mr. Bernstein. Thank you.
Mr. Bernstein?
You don't expect me to keep any of those promises, do you?
And now, gentlemen!
Your complete attention, if you please.
Are we going to declare war on Spain?
I said, "Are we going to declare war on Spain, or are we not?"
The Inquirer already has.
You long faced, overdressed anarchist.
I'm not overdressed.
You are, too.
Mr. Bernstein, look at his necktie.
Let's have the song about Charlie.
Is there a song about Charlie?
Is there a song about you, Mr. Kane?
You buy a bag of peanuts in this town, you get a song written about you.
Good evening, Mr. Kane.
"There is a man, a certain man
"And for the poor you may be sure that he'll do all he can
"Who is this one?
This favorite son
"Just by his action has the traction magnates on the run
"Who loves to smoke, enjoys a joke
"Who wouldn't get a bit upset if he were really broke
"With wealth and fame he's still the same
"I'll bet you $5 you're not alive if you don't know his name
"What is his name?
"It's Charlie Kane, it's Mister Kane!
"He doesn't like that Mister He likes good old Charlie Kane"
Isn't it wonderful? Such a party. Yes.
What's the matter?
"Who buys the food, who buys the drinks
"Who thinks that dough was made to spend and acts the way he thinks
"Now is it, Joe, no, no, no"
Bernstein, these men who are now with the Inquirer who were with the Chronicle until yesterday
Where did you learn that, Charlie?
Bernstein, these men who were with the Chronicle weren't they just as devoted to the Chronicle policy as they are now to our policies?
Sure, they're just like anybody else.
They got work to do, they do it.
Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
Do we stand for the same things the Chronicle stands for?
Certainly not.
Listen, Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane.
Without his knowing it.
Mr. Leland, I got a cable from Mr. Kane!
I got a cable here from Mr. Kane.
From Paris, France.
What?
From Paris, France.
Come on in.
"Who by his action has the traction magnates on the run"
It's a good thing he promised not to send back any more statues.
Look, he wants to buy the world's biggest diamond.
Why didn't you go to Europe with him?
He wanted you to.
I wanted Charlie to have fun, with me along....
Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?
Am I a horse faced hypocrite?
Am I a New England schoolmarm?
Yes.
If you thought I'd answer you different from what Mr. Kane tells you, I wouldn't.
"World's biggest diamond." I didn't know Charlie was collecting diamonds.
He ain't.
He's collecting somebody that's collecting diamonds.
Anyway, he ain't only collecting statues.
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane...
"...from 467 employees of the New York Inquirer."
Here he comes!
I know I've a moustache. It looks awful. Have we got a society editor?
Right here, Mr. Kane. Miss Townsend is the society editor.
Miss Townsend, this is Mr. Charles Foster Kane.
Miss Townsend, I've been away so long.
I don't know your routine.
I got a little social announcement.
I wish you wouldn't treat this any differently than you would any other social announcement.
Mr. Kane, on behalf of all the employees of the Inquirer
Mr. Bernstein, thank you very much, everybody, I....
I'm sorry, I can't accept it now.
Goodbye.
Say, he was in an awful hurry.
Hey, everybody, look out here.
Let's go to the window.
Mr. Leland! Mr. Bernstein!
Yes, Ms. Townsend?
This announcement: "Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Monroe Norton...
"...announce the engagement of their daughter, Emily Monroe Norton...
"...to Mr. Charles Foster Kane."
Come on.
Emily Monroe Norton, she's the niece of the President of the United States.
President's niece?
Before he's through, she'll be a president's wife.
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you.
Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud.
It didn't end very well, did it?
It ended.
Then there was Susie.
That ended, too.
You know, Mr. Thompson, I was thinking this Rosebud you're trying to find out about....
Yes?
Maybe that was something he lost.
Mr. Kane was a man who lost almost everything he had.
You ought to see Jed Leland.
Of course, he and Mr. Kane didn't exactly see eye to eye.
You take the Spanish American war.
I guess Mr. Leland was right. That was Mr. Kane's war.
We didn't really have anything to fight about.
Do you think if it hadn't been for that war of Mr. Kane's we'd have the Panama Canal?
I wish I knew where Mr. Leland was.
A lot of the time now they don't tell me these things.
Maybe even he's dead.
In case you'd like to know he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
You don't say.
I had Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me, just....
Just old age.
It's the only disease that you don't look forward to being cured of.
I can remember absolutely everything, young man.
That's my curse.
That's one of the greatest curses ever inflicted on the human race: memory.
I was his oldest friend, and as far as I was concerned, he behaved like a swine.
Not that Charlie was ever brutal.
He just did brutal things.
Maybe I wasn't his friend, but if I wasn't, he never had one.
Maybe I was what you nowadays call a stooge.
You were about to say something about Rosebud.
Do you happen to have a good cigar?
I've got a young physician here who thinks I'm going to give up smoking.
No, I'm afraid I haven't. Sorry.
I changed the subject, didn't I?
What a disagreeable old man I have become.
You're a reporter and you want to know what I think about Charlie Kane.
I suppose he had some private sort of greatness.
But he kept it to himself.
He never gave himself away.
He never gave anything away.
He just left you a tip.
He had a generous mind.
I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.
But he never believed in anything except Charlie Kane.
He never had a conviction except Charlie Kane in his life.
I suppose he died without one.
That must have been pretty unpleasant.
Of course, a lot of us check out without having any special convictions about death.
But we do know what we're leaving.
We do believe in something.
Are you absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
Never mind.
What do you know about Rosebud? "Rosebud"?
His dying words: "Rosebud."
I saw that in the Inquirer.
I never believed anything I saw in the Inquirer.
Anything else?
I can tell you about Emily.
I went to dancing school with Emily.
I was very graceful.
We were talking about the first Mrs. Kane.
What was she like?
She was like all the girls I knew in dancing school.
Very nice girl.
Emily was a little nicer.
After the first couple of months she and Charlie didn't see much of each other except at breakfast.
It was a marriage just like any other marriage.
You're beautiful. I can't be. Yes, you are.
I've never been to six parties in one night before.
I've never been up this late. It's a matter of habit.
What will the servants think? That we enjoyed ourselves.
Why do you have to go straight off to the newspaper?
You never should've married a newspaperman, they're worse than sailors.
I absolutely adore you.
Charles, even newspapermen have to sleep.
I'll call Mr. Bernstein and have him put off my appointments till noon.
What time is it?
I don't know. It's late.
It's early.
Charles....
Do you know how long you kept me waiting last night when you went to the newspaper for 10 minutes?
What do you do in a newspaper in the middle of the night?
My dear, your only correspondent is the Inquirer.
Sometimes I think I'd prefer a rival of flesh and blood.
I don't spend that much time on the newspaper.
It isn't just the time.
It's what you print, attacking the President.
You mean Uncle John. I mean the President of the United States.
He's still Uncle John and a well meaning fathead who's letting a pack of high pressure crooks run his administration.
This whole oil scandal He happens to be the President, not you.
That's a mistake that will be corrected one of these days.
Your Mr. Bernstein sent Junior the most incredible atrocity yesterday.
I simply can't have it in the nursery.
Mr. Bernstein is apt to pay a visit to the nursery now and then.
Does he have to? Yes.
Really, Charles, people will think What I tell them to think.
Wasn't he ever in love with her?
He married for love.
Love. That is why he did everything.
That's why he went into politics.
It seems we weren't enough.
He wanted all the voters to love him, too.
All he wanted out of life was love.
That's Charlie's story. How he lost it.
You see, he just didn't have any to give.
He loved Charlie Kane, of course.
Very dearly.
And his mother, I guess he always loved her.
How about his second wife?
Susan Alexander?
You know what Charlie called her?
The day after he'd met her, he told me about her.
He said she was "a cross section of the American public."
I guess he couldn't help it.
She must have had something for him.
That first night, according to Charlie all she had was a toothache.
What are you laughing at, young lady?
What's the matter with you?
Toothache.
What? Toothache. Toothache?
You mean you've got a toothache.
What's funny about that?
You're funny, mister. You've got dirt on your face.
Not dirt, it's mud.
Do you want some hot water?
I live right here.
What's that, young lady?
I said, if you wanted some hot water I could get you some...hot water.
All right, thank you very much.
Do I look any better now?
This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
What you need is to get your mind off it.
Excuse me, but my landlady prefers me to keep this door open when I have a gentleman caller.
All right.
You have got a toothache, haven't you?
I surely have. Why don't you try laughing at me again? What?
I'm still pretty funny.
I know, but you don't want me to laugh at you.
I don't want your tooth to hurt, either.
Look at me. See that?
What are you doing? I'm wiggling both my ears at the same time.
That's it, smile.
It took me two solid years at the best boys' school in the world to learn that.
The fellow who taught me is now president of Venezuela.
That's it!
Is it a giraffe?
No, not a giraffe. I bet it is.
What? Well, then it's an elephant.
It's supposed to be a rooster.
You know an awful lot of tricks.
Are you a professional magician?
No, I'm not a magician.
I was just joking. You really don't know who I am?
You told me your name, Mr. Kane, but I'm awfully ignorant.
I guess you caught on to that. I bet I've heard your name a million times.
You really like me, though, even though you don't know who I am?
I surely do. You've been wonderful.
Without you I don't know what I would have done.
I had a toothache, and I don't know many people.
I know too many people.
I guess we're both lonely.
Want to know what I was going to do before I ruined my best Sunday clothes?
I bet they're not your best Sunday clothes.
You probably have more. I was just joking.
I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouse in search of my youth.
You see, my mother died a long time ago.
Her things were put in storage out West.
There wasn't any other place to put them.
I thought I'd send for them now. Tonight I was going to take a look at them.
A sort of sentimental journey.
I run a couple of newspapers.
What do you do?
Me?
How old did you say you were? I didn't say.
If you had, I wouldn't have asked you.
Pretty old. How old?
Twenty two in August. That's a ripe old age.
What do you do? I work at Seligman's.
I'm in charge of the sheet music.
Is that what you want to do?
No, I wanted to be a singer, I guess.
That is, I didn't.
My mother did for me. What happened to the singing?
Mother always thought, she always talked about grand opera for me.
Imagine. But my voice isn't that kind.
It's just, you know what mothers are like.
Yes.
Have you got a piano?
Yes, there's one in the parlor.
Would you sing for me?
You wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Yes, I would.
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you.
No, that's all gone.
All right.
Let's go to the parlor.
There is only one man who can rid the politics of this state of the evil domination of Boss Jim Gettys.
I am speaking of Charles Foster Kane, the fighting liberal the friend of the workingman, the next governor of this state who entered upon this campaign. with one purpose only:
To point out and make public the dishonesty the downright villainy of Boss Jim W. Gettys' political machine now in complete control of the government of this state.
I made no campaign promises because, until a few weeks ago, I had no hope of being elected.
Now, however, I have something more than a hope.
Jim Gettys has something less than a chance.
Every straw vote every independent poll shows that I will be elected.
Very well.
Now I can afford to make some promises.
The workingman and the slum child know they can expect my best efforts in their interests.
The decent, ordinary citizens know that I'll do everything in my power to protect the underprivileged, the underpaid, and the underfed.
Mother, is Pop governor yet?
Not yet, Junior.
I'd make my promises now if I weren't too busy arranging to keep them.
But here's one promise I'll make and Boss Jim Gettys knows I'll keep it.
My first official act as governor of this state will be to appoint a special district attorney to arrange for the indictment prosecution and conviction of Boss Jim W. Gettys.
If the election were held today, you'd be in by 100,000 votes. Gettys isn't even pretending.
Pop. Hello, son.
He isn't just scared, he's sick. It's beginning to dawn on Jim Gettys I mean what I say.
Did you like your old man's speech?
I could hear every word. Hello, Emily.
Great speech, Mr. Kane. Wonderful.
Will you get us a taxi?
I'm sending Junior home in the car with Oliver.
Good night, Father.
Goodbye, son.
Why did you send Junior home in the car?
What are you doing in a taxi?
There's a call I want you to make with me.
It can wait.
No, it can't.
What's this all about, Emily? It may not be about anything at all.
I intend to find out.
Where are you going? I'm going to "185 West 74th Street."
If you wish, you may come with me.
I'll come with you.
I had no idea you had this flair for melodrama, Emily.
Come right in, Mr. Kane.
Charlie.
He forced me to send your wife that letter.
I didn't want to. He's been saying the most terrible....
Mrs. Kane.
I don't suppose anybody would introduce us.
I'm Jim Gettys.
Yes?
I made Miss Alexander send you the note, Mrs. Kane.
She didn't want to at first. But she did it.
Charlie, the things he said to me.... He threatened to
I won't wait until I'm elected.
To start with, I think I'll break your neck.
Maybe you can do it, and maybe you can't.
Your breaking this man's neck would scarcely explain this note:
"Serious consequences for Mr. Kane, for yourself and for your son."
He wanted to get her to come here What does this note mean?
I'm Susan Alexander. I know what you're thinking
What does this note mean, Ms. Alexander?
She don't know.
She sent it because I told her it wouldn't be smart not to. Emily, this gentleman I'm not a gentleman.
Your husband is only trying to be funny calling me one.
I don't even know what a gentleman is.
You see, my idea of a gentleman....
If I owned a paper and didn't like the way somebody was doing things some politician, I'd fight him with all I had.
I wouldn't show him in a convict suit so his family could see his picture in the paper.
You're a cheap, crooked grafter We're talking now about what you are.
I'm fighting for my life, not just my political life.
He said unless you That's what I said.
Here's the chance I'm willing to give him.
It's more of a chance than he'd give me.
Unless he decides by tomorrow that he's so sick he has to go away for a year Monday morning, all papers in the state, except his, will carry the story I'll give.
What story?
The story about him and Ms. Alexander.
There isn't any story!
Shut up.
We've got evidence that would look bad in the headlines. Do you want me to give you the evidence?
I'd rather he withdrew without having the story published.
Not that I care about him, but I'd be better off that way.
So would you, Mrs. Kane.
What about me?
He said my name would be dragged through the mud.
That everywhere I went
There seems to be only one decision you can make, Charles.
I'd say that it'd been made for you.
You can't tell me the voters of this state
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.
I am interested in our son.
Charlie, if they publish this story They won't.
Good night, Mr. Gettys.
Are you coming, Charles?
No.
I'm staying here.
I can fight this all alone.
If you don't listen to reason, it may be too late.
Too late?
For what?
For you and this public thief to take the love of the people away from me?
You got other things to think about. Your little boy.
You don't want him to read about you in the papers.
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'll do.
You decided what you were going to do, Charles, some time ago.
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought.
I've got nothing to say to you.
You're licked
Get out. If you want to see me, have the warden write me a letter.
If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.
Only you're going to need more than one lesson.
And you'll get more than one lesson.
Don't worry about me, Gettys.
Don't worry about me!
I'm Charles Foster Kane!
I'm no cheap, crooked politician trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes!
Gettys!
I'm gonna send you to Sing Sing.
Sing Sing, Gettys.
Have you a car, Mrs. Kane?
Yes, thank you.
Good night.
Read all about it. Extra, extra.
Paper? No, thanks.
With a million majority already against him and the church counties still to be heard from I'm afraid we got no choice.
This one?
That one.
Good night again.
Is there anything I can No, thanks, Mr. Bernstein.
You better go home and get some sleep.
You, too.
Good night, Mr. Kane.
Hello, Jedediah. I'm drunk.
If you've got drunk to talk to me about Ms. Alexander, don't bother.
I'm not interested.
I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it?
All right.
If that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice.
It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me.
You talk about the people as though you owned them.
As though they belong to you. Goodness.
As long as I can remember, you've talked about giving the people their rights as if you could make them a present of liberty as a reward for services rendered.
Jed. You remember the workingman?
I'll get drunk, too, Jedediah if it'll do any good.
It won't do any good.
Besides you never get drunk.
You used to write an awful lot about the workingman Go on home. He's turning into something called "organized labor."
You won't like that one little bit when you find out it means your workingman expects something as his right, and not your gift.
When your precious underprivileged really get together....
Oh, boy....
That'll add up to something bigger than your privilege then I don't know what you'll do.
Sail away to a desert island probably and lord it over the monkeys.
I wouldn't worry about it too much.
There'll probably be a few of them there to tell me when I do something wrong.
You may not always be so lucky.
You're not very drunk.
Drunk, what do you care?
You don't care about anything except you.
You persuade people that you love them so much that they ought to love you back.
Only you want love on your own terms.
It's something to be played your way, according to your rules.
Let me work on the Chicago paper.
What? You said you were looking for someone to do dramatic "crimitism," criticism.
I am drunk.
I want to go to Chicago.
You're too valuable here.
There's nothing left for me to do All right, you can go to Chicago.
Thank you.
I guess I'd better try to get drunk anyway.
I warn you, Jedediah, you won't like Chicago.
The wind comes off the lake, and they've probably never heard of Lobster Newburg.
Will Saturday after next be all right? Anytime you say. Thank you.
A toast to love on my terms.
Those are the only terms anybody knows:
Mr. Kane, I'm from the Inquirer.
What's that, young man?
Are you through with politics?
Am I through with politics?
I would say vice versa.
We're going to be an opera star.
Are you singing at the Metropolitan? We certainly are.
Charlie said if I didn't, he'd build me an opera house. That won't be necessary.
No, no, no!
Mr. Leland is writing it from the dramatic angle?
And we've covered it from the news end.
And the social.
How about the music notice?
Yes, it's already made up.
Mr. Mowan wrote a swell review.
Enthusiastic?
Yes, sir. Mr. Kane.
This is a surprise.
We've got two spreads of pictures.
The music notice on the front page?
But there's still one notice to come.
The dramatic.
The dramatic notice.
Mr. Bernstein, that's Mr. Leland, isn't it?
Yes, we're waiting for it.
Where is he?
Right in there, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane.
Mr. Leland and Mr. Kane haven't spoken together for years.
You don't suppose There's nothing to suppose.
Excuse me.
Close the door.
He ain't been drinking before.
Never. We would have heard.
What does it say there?
The notice, what's he written?
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur...
"... last night opened the new Chicago Opera House...
"...in a performance of...."
I still can't pronounce that name.
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.
"Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to...."
Go on.
That's all there is.
Of her acting it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that, in the opinion of this reviewer, it represents a new low.
In the opinion of this reviewer.
I didn't see that. It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein, I'm dictating it.
Mr. Kane, I Get me a typewriter.
I'm going to finish Mr. Leland's notice.
Hello, Bernstein.
Hello. Hello, Mr. Leland.
Where's my notice, Bernstein? I've got to finish my notice.
Mr. Kane is finishing it for you.
Charlie?
Charlie out there?
I guess he's fixing it up.
I knew I'd never get that through.
Mr. Kane's finishing your review just the way you started it.
He's writing a bad notice like you wanted it to be.
I guess that'll show you.
Hello, Jedediah.
Hello, Charlie.
I didn't know we were speaking.
Sure we're speaking, Jedediah.
You're fired.
Everybody knows that story, Mr. Leland, but why did he do it?
How could a man write a notice You just don't know Charlie.
He thought that by finishing that notice he'd show me he was an honest man.
He was always trying to prove something.
That whole thing about Susie being an opera singer.
That was trying to prove something.
You know what the headline was the day before the election?
"Candidate Kane found in love nest with 'singer."'
He was going to take the quotes off the singer.
Hey, nurse! Five years ago he wrote from that place down there in the South.
What's it called, Shangri la?
Sloppy Joe's? What's the name?
All right, Xanadu, I knew it all the time.
You caught on, didn't you?
I'm not that hard to see through.
Well, I never even answered his letter.
Maybe I should have.
I guess he was pretty lonely down there in that coliseum all those years.
He hadn't finished it when she left him.
He never finished it.
He never finished anything except my notice.
Of course, he built the joint for her.
That must have been love.
I don't know.
He was disappointed in the world so he built his own, an absolute monarchy.
It was something bigger than an opera house anyway.
Nurse. Yes, Mr. Leland.
I'm coming.
There's one thing you can do for me.
Sure.
Stop at the cigar store on your way out, and get me a couple of good cigars.
Be glad to. Thank you.
One is enough.
When I was a young man, there was an impression that nurses were pretty.
Well, it was no truer then than it is today.
I'll take your arm.
All right. You won't forget about those cigars?
I won't.
Have them wrapped like toothpaste, or they'll stop them at the desk.
You know that young doctor I was telling you about, well he's got an idea he wants to keep me alive.
I'd rather you'd just talk.
Anything that comes into your mind about yourself and Mr. Kane.
You don't want to hear what comes into my mind about myself and Charlie Kane.
You know, maybe I shouldn't have sung for Charlie that first time I met him.
But I did an awful lot of singing after that.
I sang for teachers at $100 an hour.
The teachers got that, I didn't.
What did you get? I didn't get a thing, except music lessons.
That's all there was in it. He married you, didn't he?
He didn't mention anything about marriage until after it was over and until it got in the papers about us and he lost the election, and that Norton woman divorced him.
He was really interested in my voice.
Why did he build that opera house?
I didn't want it.
I didn't want a thing. It was his idea.
Everything was his idea except my leaving him.
?
"Don't forget" Don't get nervous.
Please. Let's come back.
Look at me, Mrs. Kane, darling.
"Diaphragm"
You're out of pitch.
Some people can sing. Some can't.
Impossible.
It's not your job to give your opinion of Mrs. Kane's talents.
You're supposed to train her voice, Signor Matiste.
Nothing more.
Please continue with the lesson.
But, Mr. Kane.
Please.
I'll be the laughingstock of the musical world.
People will think
You're concerned what people will think?
Perhaps I can enlighten you a bit. I'm an authority on what people will think.
The newspapers for example.
I run several newspapers between here and San Francisco.
It's all right, darling. Signor Matiste is going to listen to reason.
How can I persuade you You can't.
It's all right, darling, go ahead.
I thought you'd see it my way.
No, no, no.
I think it's dreadful. ?
Stop telling me he's your friend.
A friend don't write that kind of review.
All these other papers panning me, I could expect that.
But for the Inquirer to run a thing like that, spoiling my whole debut.
I'll get it. Friend.
Not the kind of friends I know but I'm not high class like you.
And I never went to any swell schools.
That'll be enough, Susan. From Mr. Leland, sir.
He wanted me to make sure you got this personally.
Is that something from him?
Charlie!
As for you, you ought to have your head examined.
Sending him a letter telling him he's fired with a $25,000 check in it.
What kind of firing do you call that?
You did send him a check for $25,000, didn't you?
Yes.
I sent him a check for $25,000.
What's that?
Declaration of Principles. What?
What is it?
An antique.
You're awful funny, aren't you?
I'll tell you one thing you're not going to be funny about, and that's my singing.
I'm through. I never wanted to do it in the first place.
You'll continue with your singing, Susan.
I don't propose to have myself made ridiculous.
You don't propose to have yourself made ridiculous!
What about me? I'm the one that has to sing.
I'm the one that gets the raspberries.
Why don't you leave me alone?
My reasons satisfy me, Susan.
You seem unable to understand them.
I will not tell them to you again.
You'll continue with your singing.
Get Dr. Corey.
Susan.
She'll be perfectly all right in a day or two, Mr. Kane.
I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a foolish mistake.
The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her was in a somewhat larger bottle.
The strain of preparing for the new opera has excited and confused her.
Yes, I'm sure that was it.
No objections to my staying with her are there?
No, not at all.
I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Good night, Mr. Kane.
Charlie.
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.
But I couldn't go through with the singing again.
You don't know what it means to know that people....
That the whole audience doesn't want you.
That's when you got to fight them.
All right.
You won't have to fight them anymore.
It's their loss.
What are you doing?
Jigsaw puzzles?
Charlie, what time is it?
11:30. In New York?
I said what time is it in New York?
11 :30. Night?
The Bulldog's just gone to press.
Well, hurray for the Bulldog.
Gee, 11:30.
Shows are just getting up.
People are going to nightclubs and restaurants.
Of course, we're different because we live in a palace.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
A person could go crazy in this dump.
Nobody to talk to, nobody to have any fun with.
49,000 acres of nothing but scenery and statues.
I'm lonesome.
Until yesterday, we've had no less than 50 of your friends at any one time.
I think if you look in the west wing you'll probably find a dozen vacationists still in residence.
You make a joke out of everything.
Charlie, I want to go to New York.
I'm tired of being a hostess.
I want to have fun. Please, Charlie.
Charlie, please.
Our home is here, Susan.
I don't care to visit New York.
What are you doing?
One thing I can never understand:
How do you know you haven't done it before?
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting statues.
You may be right.
I sometimes wonder but you get into the habit.
It's not a habit, I do it because I like it.
I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow.
Invite everybody to spend the night at the Everglades.
Invite everybody. Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents.
Who wants to sleep in tents when they've got their own room with a bath, where they know where everything is?
I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow.
You never give me anything I really care about.
"I wonder what it is"
Sure, you give me things, but that don't mean anything to you.
You're in a tent, darling, you're not at home.
I can hear you very well if you speak in a normal tone of voice.
What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving someone $100,000 for a statue you'll keep crated up and never look at?
It's just money.
It doesn't mean anything.
You never really gave me anything that you care about. I want you to stop this.
I'm not going to stop it.
You never gave me anything in your life.
You just tried to buy me into giving you something.
Whatever I do, I do because I love you.
You don't love me.
You want me to love you. Sure. "I'm Charles Foster Kane.
"Whatever you want, just name it and it's yours.
"But you gotta love me."
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm not sorry.
Mr. Kane?
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, sir.
Marie has been packing for her since morning.
Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie.
Tell him he can get the bags. Yes, madame.
Have you gone completely crazy?
Don't you know that our guests, that everyone will know about this?
Packed your bag, sent for the car And left you?
Of course they'll hear.
I'm not saying goodbye, except to you.
But I never imagined people wouldn't know.
I won't let you go.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Susan.
Please don't go.
Please, Susan.
From now on, everything will be exactly the way you want it to be.
Not the way I think you want it, but your way.
You mustn't go.
You can't do this to me.
I see.
It's you that this is being done to.
It's not me at all.
Not what it means to me.
I can't do this to you?
Oh, yes, I can.
In case you haven't heard, I lost all my money and it was plenty.
The last 10 years have been difficult for many.
They haven't been tough on me.
I just lost all my money. You're going down to Xanadu?
Monday, with boys from the office.
Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed.
We run a picture magazine.
If you're smart, you'll get in touch with Raymond.
He's the butler. You'll learn a lot from him.
He knows where all the bodies are buried.
You know, all the same, I feel kind of sorry for Mr. Kane.
Don't you think I do?
What do you know, it's morning already.
Come around and tell me the story of your life sometime.
Rosebud?
I'll tell you about Rosebud.
How much is it worth to you?
$1,000?
Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson.
He acted funny sometimes, you know?
No, I didn't. Yes, he did crazy things sometimes.
I've been working for him 11 years now in charge of the whole place, so I ought to know.
Rosebud.
Yes.
Like I tell you, the old man acted kind of funny sometimes but I knew how to handle him Need a lot of service?
But I knew how to handle him.
Like that time his wife left.
Rosebud.
I see.
And that's what you know about Rosebud?
I heard him say it that other time, too.
He just said:
"Rosebud."
Then he dropped the glass ball and it broke on the floor.
He didn't say anything after that, and I knew he was dead.
He said all kinds of things that didn't mean anything.
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Yes and no.
That isn't worth $1,000. You can keep on asking questions if you want to.
We're leaving tonight when we're through taking pictures.
Allow yourself plenty of time.
The train stops at the junction on signal, but they don't like to wait.
I can remember when they'd wait all day if Mr. Kane said so.
Better get going.
Can we come down?
Yes, hurry up.
We're leaving.
How much do you think this is all worth, Mr. Thompson?
Millions.
If anybody wants it.
Well, at least he brought all this stuff to America.
What's that?
Another Venus. $25,000.
A lot of money to pay for a dame without a head.
The banks are out of luck?
They'll clear all right.
He never threw anything away.
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane, from 467 employees of the New York Inquirer."
"One stove from the estate of Mary Kane, Little Salem, Colorado.
Value: $2."
We're supposed to get everything, junk as well as art.
He sure liked to collect things.
Anything and everything. A regular crow, eh?
Hey, look, a jigsaw puzzle. We got a lot of those.
A Burmese temple and three Spanish ceilings down the hall.
Part of a Scotch castle that needs to be unwrapped.
Put all this stuff together:
The palaces and the paintings, and the toys and everything.
What would it spell?
Charles Foster Kane?
Or Rosebud. How about it, Jerry?
What's Rosebud?
That's what he said when he died.
Did you ever find out what it means?
No, I didn't.
What did you find out about him?
Not much, really.
We'd better get started.
What have you been doing all this time?
Playing with a jigsaw puzzle.
If you'd discovered what Rosebud meant, I bet it would've explained everything.
No, I don't think so.
No.
He was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it.
Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get or something he lost.
It wouldn't have explained anything.
I don't think any word can explain a man's life.
No.
I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle.
A missing piece.
Come on, everybody we'll miss the train.
Throw that junk in.
Extra!
Extra!
Read all about it!
Blonde model murdered!
Slayer's still at large!
Read all about it!
- Hey, boy!
- Yes, sir.
Thanks. Extra!
Read all about it!
- [Man] If you know what's good for you, you'll come clean.
- When did you find the body?
- Why'd you do it?
- I didn't do it.
- You've said that before.
- All right, and I'll say it again.
- I can keep it up as long as you can.
- Listen, brother.
You don't seem to get the idea at all. You're gonna fry for this.
- It means the hot spot.
- It does if you can pin it on me, but I don't think you can.
I think we can.
You're a pretty tough guy, aren't you, with a crowd around?
- Why don't you come out in the open so I can see you?
- Never mind that.
- When did you first meet Vicky Lynn?
- [Sighs]
Say, listen, fellas. Why don't you let me make a record of it... then you can play it over to yourselves as often as you like. Why...
Go ahead, Frankie, just once more.
Pick it up when you met her for the first time in that lunchroom on 8th Avenue.
- Okay, MacDonald. For you, I'll do it.
- Thanks.
I'd been to the fights with a couple of friends of mine.
We'd just dropped in for a cup of coffee, and...
- And hotcakes and coffee.
- Is that all?
No, but the rest of it isn't on the menu.
You couldn't afford it if it was.
- Say, you know something?
I'm wasting my time being just an ordinary waitress.
[Chuckles] Frankie, you're losing your grip.
I bet I can take that girl... inside of six months, put her on top of the ladder.
What ladder?
You've promoted everything from prize-fighters to fan dancers... but I doubt if even you, maestro, could make a lady out of a hash slinger.
In the right clothes, the right places with the right people, she could get by anywhere.
It might be fun trying, even if it didn't work.
Here she comes now, Frankie. Pour on the charm.
How would you like to go to the El Chico Club tomorrow night?
- This is where I came in.
- I'm not kidding.
I'll put you in a sable wrap and introduce you to café society. What do you say?
I say you're out of your mind.
~ [Band]
Eleanor, I wish you had seen me as Romeo. I was magnificent.
- That was a long time ago, wasn't it?
- How old are you, anyhow?
That, my dear Lady Handel, is a secret that I keep even from my own mother.
- Ah.
- Who is that beautiful girl?
- Good evening, Mr. Christopher.
- Good evening.
I have your table for you.
I say, I'm in luck. It just happens I know the man that's with her.
- Who is he?
- Frankie Christopher, a sports promoter.
Prizefights, hockey, ice carnivals and girls.
Mostly girls. Excuse me.
- Wine with the dinner and coffee later.
- Very good, sir.
- Hello, Christopher.
- Hello, Ray.
Miss Lynn, I'd like you to meet the famous actor, Robin Ray.
Actor?
Really? How do you do?
Listen, you little hash slinger, don't give me any of that "lady" stuff, or I'll bite you.
- Am I overdoing it?
- Yes, but not bad.
Hello, Christopher. How are things?
- How do you think?
- I think yes.
Miss Lynn, I'd like you to know Larry Evans, the columnist.
- Larry, this is Miss Vicky Lynn.
- How do you do, Mr. Evans?
- I've read much about you.
- Indeed. Flattering, I hope.
Naturally. Most of it appeared in your own column.
- Ouch.
- Keep it up, Vicky. Swell.
Yeah. That last line wasn't in the script. Well, sit down, boys.
Sit down. Lynn?
Lynn?
Of the Baltimore Lynns, by any chance?
No, no. My family came from Boston, the home of the bean, you know?
Is that so?
Do tell.
- May I have the next mazurka?
- Oh, I'd simply love it.
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I didn't bring Miss Lynn for you two chiselers to cut in. Come on, boys. Fight over her.
If she dances with anybody, it's going to be with me.
Let us settle this dispute by claiming the ancient privilege of age before beauty.
- Go scuttle yourself. I saw her first.
- You can't talk to me like that.
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.
- Beg your pardon.
Lady Handel presents her compliments... and would like to have Mr. Christopher and his party have supper with her.
Why, we'd be delighted.
Well, you're in, Vicky. Just pick up your feet and feel your way.
- [Clears Throat]
- Come on, Vicky.
All right, boys. Let's go.
May I present Miss Lynn and Mr. Christopher? Lady Handel.
- How do you do, Miss Lynn?
- How do you do?
- And Mr. Christopher.
- How do you do?
- Won't you be seated?
- Thank you.
Robin, you sit here.
You haven't put a price on yourself yet.
[Horns Honking, Distant]
Well, I'll do everything I can: Give you a plug in the column every once in a while.
You might do worse than to have your name linked with mine.
I don't see how.
Good evening, Harry. May I please have my key?
Get that key for Miss Lynn, and be quick about it.
Well, uh, good night, gentlemen.
It's been wonderful, and I'm terribly grateful to you all.
- Well, can't we go up for a moment?
- Oh, I'm afraid not.
It's pretty late, and we might disturb my sister.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- I'll be around for you first thing in the morning.
I'll be waiting for you.
- "Sister."
- I hate girls with sisters.
- What are you beefing about?
Have you seen her yet?
- No. Have you?
- No.
- Then we're neck and neck.
They day I find you and I are neck and neck, I'll know I'm running down.
What's the matter with you, gettin' so sore?
She ain't nobody.
She will be, and when she is, you'll be lucky if you're in the same neighborhood.
- What made you so sure you could make something of her?
- That's my business: Promotion.
She had looks, youth, a good figure. What more do you want?
- I'm asking the questions.
- Then hurry up. I've got an appointment at the Garden.
- Okay, MacDonald.
- Now, listen, Frankie.
There's been a murder committed, and we're just trying to get to the bottom of things.
That's all.
- [Man] What's your name?
- [Woman]Jill Lynn.
- [Man] Any initials?
- No. Just plain "Jill."
- What relation are you to the dead girl?
- She was my sister.
How long have you been living in New York?
Well, Vicky had been here a couple of years, and after Mom died...
I came on from Chicago to set up housekeeping with her.
Even though we shared the apartment, I saw very little of her the last few weeks.
- Why was that?
- Well, you see, I have a position as a stenographer downtown... and Vicky was working on a night shift in a restaurant.
- We just kept different hours.
- What do you know about this man Frankie Christopher?
Nothing, except he was the one who first gave Vicky those grand ideas... about becoming a celebrity.
When did this start?
The first time I knew it was serious was the night she came home from a nightclub.
It was very late, and I had fallen asleep on the couch.
[Door Unlatching]
Jill. Jill, what do you think?
I've done it. I'm a success.
- What is all this?
- You know what happened?
Lady Handel invited me over to her table.
I met all the big shots, danced with all the good-looking young men.
I've just got dozens and dozens of invitations.
Invitations to do what?
- I'm never going back to that rotten old restaurant job.
- What?
Why should I?
Now I realize I've been wasting my time.
- I can be somebody.
- Vicky, you're not serious about giving up your job?
Of course. Why should I go on slinging hash when I can sling other things?
Vicky Lynn, have you gone right out of your mind?
No, I haven't. I've just come to my senses. That's all.
Frankie Christopher thinks I have a great career before me.
- Who's Frankie Christopher?
- Oh, Jill, everyone knows Frankie Christopher.
- He's a famous sports promoter.
- What does he want you to do?
Roller-skate or go over Niagara Falls in a barrel?
Jill, I already have an offer to pose for a magazine cover and a cigarette ad...
Vicky, wait a minute. When Mom died, we promised we'd look out for each other.
Don't you think you're making a fool of yourself?
- What do you mean?
- This Frankie Christopher.
People like that, what have they got to do with people like us?
- Jill, they're going to help me.
- In what way?
They're gonna glamorize me.
They may have started this thing as a gag, but after taking one look... at those million-dollar debutantes tonight...
I realized I can give them cards in spades and still come out on top.
Vicky, you'll never come out on top by any shortcut.
One week, your face is on the cover of a magazine; the next, it's in the ash can.
I know I sound stuffy. Gee, I like a good time as well as the next.
Jill, you're terribly sweet, but, well, we are different.
I know the things I want, and I know how to get them.
So stop worrying about me, huh?
Okay.
What you need now is sleep. If you lose your looks, you've lost your bankroll.
Good night.
[Man] When was the first time you met Frankie Christopher?
It was the following morning. I was cooking breakfast...
[Knocking]
- Vicky, I think he's here.
- [Vicky] Okay. I'm putting on a dress.
- Is Miss Lynn in?
- Which Miss Lynn?
The glamour girl, or just the plain, ordinary garden variety?
- Ohh, you're her sister.
- You're quick.
- I'm Frankie Christopher.
- That's what I was afraid of.
- May I come in?
- Sure.
Course, this is just a dump, but if you can find a place to sit down...
Say, why all the cracks?
You don't know anything about me yet.
I don't know anything about art, but I know what I like.
What's the idea of handing Vicky this line about making her a big shot?
That's no line. I believe it sincerely.
After all, that's my business... discovering talent and trying to put it across.
Here. Take a look at that.
Hmm. Feeding time at the zoo.
- Where are you?
- I don't believe in having my picture taken.
That's for those I'm trying to put across. I just stay in the background, where I belong.
- Modest, aren't you?
- Not particularly.
It's just a superstition, that's all.
- [Vicky] Is that Frankie?
- Yes, dear.
Hold him for me, Jill. Don't let him get away.
You come out and do your own holding.
- Good morning, Frankie.
- That's a nice dress you've put on.
From that moment on, life became just one great, dizzy world for her.
She got offers to pose for advertisements... model clothes, join the ice ballet, every possible form of publicity.
She even remembered the singing lessons Mom had paid for... and suddenly started to fancy herself as a chanteuse.
Frankie even managed to get her a job singing with a name band.
Finally, one morning, things came to a climax.
I wonder what's keeping him. I left a message hours ago.
Why, Jill, what are you getting so excited about?
Nothing. Except he's going to be awfully mad.
- Don't worry. I can handle him.
- Glad you think so.
- I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the gold in Kentucky.
- [Knocking]
- Do you think that's him?
- Uh-huh. I know his knock. Come in.
- What's up?
- Well, it's not exactly going to be a wedding.
I'm sorry. I was up all night.
Darling, something terrible has happened. I...
I don't quite know how to tell you, it's so embarrassing, but...
Of course I realize everything you've done for me, but, well... life is so uncertain nowadays, isn't it?
- Get to the point.
- Well, I...
- I'm going away.
- Away?
Where?
I couldn't help it, really I couldn't. I just happened to run into this man, and...
Purely business, you understand.
- Where are you going?
- To Hollywood.
Hollywood?
As I said, I just happened to run into this man, and he wanted to make a screen test.
I didn't see any harm in it, so I said yes.
I didn't wanna tell you in case it turned out badly. I wanted to surprise you.
But it turned out simply wonderfully, and I've signed a long-term contract.
- When are you going?
- I leave tomorrow night.
- Congratulations.
- Oh, now, Frankie, wait a minute. I...
Look, I've always been on the level with you, haven't I?
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Oh, Frankie, I know what you're thinking.
After all, you did take me out of the restaurant, introduce me to the right people... and that sort of thing, but, well, I have some brains too.
It was me they were interested in.
Some people think I'm a very attractive girl. You didn't create that.
- I'm no Frankenstein, you know.
- I wonder.
- [Knocking]
- Come in.
Robin, Larry, how sweet of you both to come.
- What's the matter?
What happened?
- Are you all right?
- I came as soon as I got your message.
- Dear Robin, dear Larry...
Something terrible has happened.
This whole thing started me thinking I was wrong and Vicky was right.
After all, she had ended up with a Hollywood contract... and I was still pounding a typewriter and breaking my fingernails.
But that's the trouble with giving advice nowadays. So much of it turns out wrong.
When Vicky told me she had that Hollywood job set up behind my back, I...
Well, you could've knocked me down with a feather.
- So you knocked her down instead.
Is that it? - No, wise guy.
I did exactly what you would do. I got cockeyed.
~ [Popular]
- Do you mind turning that thing down a little?
- Not at all.
- Women are all alike.
- For Pete's sake, what difference does that make?
You've got to have them. They're standard equipment.
Can you imagine her walking out on me after all that I've done for her? Me!
You've done for her?
What have you done for her?
Well, I took her around to all the bright spots. I let her be seen with me everywhere.
- It made her seem important.
- Why, you parboiled old ham.
You don't think anybody thought there was anything between you two, do you?
If it hadn't been for my column, people would've thought she was your trained nurse.
Why, you ink-stinking word slinger.
I was famous when they were changing your pants 20 times a day.
What's the use of bickering?
We've all gotten it. We may as well admit it.
- Surely you got some fun out of it.
- That's where you're wrong.
All I got was a handshake, a smile and a promise.
I had to sit around with that sourpuss sister of hers waiting for Vicky to come home.
- You're kidding.
- On the level. Night after night.
Didn't you even get a souvenir?
Well, I... got this.
She gave it to me once when she had an appointment.
She told me to go up to her apartment and wait.
I waited, and she came in with you.
I'll be darned. There's another for the scrapbook.
I wonder if there could've been somebody else in her life all the time.
Well, if there was, he must've been a locksmith.
Was there anyone in her life before this Frankie Christopher?
On your last visit to New York, for instance, about a year ago?
Any little incident that you can remember may be of enormous help.
She was working in the restaurant then and working pretty hard.
She didn't have much time for running around, and...
Now that you mention it, I... I do remember a queer thing that happened.
I didn't think much of it at the time, but, well...
I was sitting in the place one night, waiting for her to finish so we could go home... when...
- I'll be with you in a minute, sis.
- Okay.
Vicky?
You seem to have an admirer.
There was some guy looking through the window at you... like the wolf looked at the three little pigs.
I'm used to that. With that plate-glass window...
I've got about as much privacy as a lingerie mannequin.
It doesn't mean a thing.
That's the one.
- Gives me the creeps.
- You'll have to get used to that.
We've got more wolves in New York than they have in Siberia.
I saw him several times after that.
He never said anything, never accosted us or bothered us in any way... but he frightened me.
There was something strange about him, the way he'd look at her... the way he'd turn up in the most unexpected places.
Perhaps if you could find that man, you'd find the murderer.
Mysterious stranger, huh?
Young lady, you'll have to do better than that. Me and my partner weren't born yesterday.
- Why are you trying to protect Frankie Christopher?
- I'm not trying to protect him.
I just don't believe he did it.
Was there ever anything between you and this Frankie Christopher?
- What are you saying?
- You were in love with him, and he didn't give you a tumble... so you put your sister out of the way. - You were in love with him, weren't you?
- That's a lie!
Let me out of here!
You have no right to talk to me like that.
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm a poor, underpaid detective trying to get at the facts.
Well, I demand to see somebody in authority!
- I wanna see the head man around here!
- Get Cornell.
- We don't wanna get tough with you unless we have to.
- I told you I didn't do it.
[Detective] Inspector, you're wanted inside.
All right, boys. Keep him warm. I'll be right back.
- Here you are.
- Thanks.
All right, young lady. Here's the head man.
That's him!
That's the man!
- What's this?
- She's crazy.
She said she saw a mysterious stranger... peeking through the window of the joint where her sister worked.
- Now she says it's Ed.
- What about it, Ed?
Do you peek through windows?
Sure. When it happens to be my district. That's my job, Miss Lynn, to look at people.
I admit he looks as if he'd do anything... but at the time of the murder, he happened to be in Albany with me.
Frankie Christopher took you and your sister out for a ride the evening before the murder.
What happened on that ride?
There's nothing important about that. Vicky was just imagining things.
- Like you?
- I'm not imagining anything! I did see you!
All right. I'm a Peeping Tom. Now, about the ride...
- Well, it's really so silly.
I hate to... - Come on. Let's have it.
Christopher just told me all about it, so you'd better not withhold anything.
Well, it was the night before Vicky was to leave for Hollywood.
Frankie came by to pick us up and take us for a ride.
We were driving along, not thinking much of anything, when... ~ [Humming]
We'll be sorry to see you go, Vicky.
- No, you won't. You'll be glad.
- [Frankie] What?
You'll be glad to get rid of me.
- Jill's in love with you. Haven't you noticed?
- Vicky, don't be silly.
I'm not silly. I've known it a long time.
She's tried to cover it up, but I've known.
You're crazy. Nothing like that's ever entered my head.
I know. It's much deeper than that.
That's why it's so dangerous. Anything might happen.
Let's go back now, shall we?
Now, she said to Christopher, "You'll be glad to get rid of me."
- Is that it, word for word? - Yes.
But she didn't mean anything like that!
What she meant we'll never know. It's what she said that counts.
Now tell us how and when you found the body.
Well, it was about 5:30 in the afternoon.
I'd gotten away early from the office.
Even as I came out of the elevator, I had a feeling something was wrong.
I don't know quite how to explain it, but there was music coming from the apartment, and... ~ [Popular]
- Vicky!
- I just came in, just this second.
Is she?
Jill, you don't think I did it, do you?
You don't, do you?
~ [Radio Switches Off]
I'm not quite clear on what happened after that.
The next thing I knew, the room was filled with police.
Thank you very much, Miss Lynn. You've been most helpful.
- I give up.
- Say, you fellas give up too easy.
How 'bout playing a couple games of gin rummy?
Exactly what did Vicky mean when she said, "You'll be glad to get rid of me"?
- Where did you get that?
- Never mind where I got it. What did she mean?
- I don't know.
- I'll tell you what she meant.
She knew you resented her running out on you.
When you left those two fellas at the bar, you started to get drunk.
You drank all that night and the next day.
Your mind became more and more inflamed... until you were mad with jealousy and hurt pride.
I say you went up there and killed her in cold blood.
- That's not true!
- It is true!
I got a good mind to kill you myself right now!
- Take it easy, Ed? Take it easy.
- [Panting]
That's all for today, Frankie. Sorry to bother you.
How 'bout a couple of tickets for the rodeo?
You don't need any seats for the rodeo.
All you need's a couple more bulls in here, and you can have one of your own.
The assistant D.A. Wants to see Christopher in his office right away.
There you are, Frankie. You see?
He probably wants to apologize.
[Chuckles]
Thanks.
- What's the idea of riding him so hard?
- I don't know.
I've had 15 years' experience in this racket.
If that isn't the look of a guilty man, I'll take the rap myself.
- Here he comes.
- What's the dope, Frankie?
- Give us a break, will ya?
- What'd he say?
- Sorry, boys. No statement.
- Allow me.
- What's the idea?
- I hear Ed Cornell is taking charge of the investigation.
- That's right.
- Brother, when that guy says you're cooked, you're cooked.
He hasn't lost a conviction in his entire career.
Here. Pin the crepe on Cornell. His career is dead.
Mr. Christopher, I'm terribly sorry if you've been caused any inconvenience.
- I hope none of our men were too rough with you.
- No, no. Not at all.
They've been perfect little gentlemen.
The fact is, somebody has made a terrible mistake.
I was just explaining... to Miss Lynn here that it seemed so logical that you were the guilty one.
- Doesn't it now? - No.
I think we know the identity of the killer.
- A boy by the name of Harry Williams... switchboard operator at the apartment house.
- Do you mind if I go now?
- Not in the least, Miss Lynn.
Sorry to have troubled you.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
What makes you think Williams did it?
We just got a call from one of our men. Williams has been missing since 5:30 last night.
He's probably hiding out somewhere, scared and shaky.
- But don't worry. - Well, you'd better be quick about it... because if I find him first, you're gonna have another murder on your hands. We'll find him.
Jill!
Jill, can't we be friends?
This is a nice time to be thinking about that.
I'm sorry you told that story about the car.
I couldn't help it. Besides, it didn't mean anything anyway.
Vicky didn't know what she was saying. You know that, don't you?
Sure. May I take you home?
No, thanks. I don't want any more reminders around than are necessary.
Well, it's the first time I ever had a bad dream with my eyes open.
- What do you want?
- Someday, you're gonna talk in your sleep... and when that day comes, I wanna be around.
It's no use, Cornell. I'm not the type.
- Have you got a warrant?
- No. This is strictly my own idea.
- I'm working on my own time.
- Then get out of here. I don't like rats in my bedroom.
Now, wait. You don't seem to realize I'm doing you a favor.
I'm keeping you posted on the progress of this case.
For instance, I found this cigarette butt crushed out in her clothes closet.
There was also an evening slipper that had been stepped on... as if somebody had waited there, hiding.
- Do you often smoke in clothes closets?
- Not since I was a kid.
It happens to be your brand.
According to the latest statistics, 10 million people smoke that brand... including the army and navy.
- Maybe it was a mass murder.
- I know it doesn't mean much by itself... but every little bit counts.
When I get all my evidence together, I'm gonna have you tied up... like a pig in a slaughterhouse.
Perhaps they're keeping it from you... but they told me at headquarters that they think Harry Williams did it.
- I think they're wrong.
- Oh, I see.
They believe Williams did it, but you're the holdout.
- You're the bright boy. Is that it?
- Maybe.
You know, you're like something out of a museum.
You oughta have a magnifying glass and one of those trick hats with earflaps.
Why don't you look in that box?
- Collar buttons.
- That's right.
Say, you're wonderful. You know, I think I'll carry you around just for laughs.
I don't mind the kidding.
You're a pretty cocky fellow, Frankie. You've had your own way for a long time.
- First with Vicky Lynn and now with her sister.
- Get out of here.
Find Harry Williams. And if I ever catch you around here again... they'll have to pick you up with a sieve. That's your job.
Hello, Harry.
- Hello, Miss Lynn.
- I thought you'd gone away.
I just went over to Brooklyn to see my parents.
I didn't realize it would cause such a fuss. I explained everything to the cops.
- Oh. I thought...
- Well, you shouldn't have thought that, Miss Lynn.
You know I wouldn't do a thing like that, don't you?
Yes.
- I'm moving. I've come for Vicky's things.
- Yes. I know.
The superintendent told me you were coming.
I have everything here, all packed and ready to go.
- But who packed them?
- I did.
Well, you shouldn't have done that. You should've gotten permission.
I wanted to help. I thought it might be of some help.
Well, as long as you've done it, thanks very much. Will you help me carry them?
[Switchboard Buzzing]
Hello?
Just a minute. It's Mr. Christopher. He wants to speak to you.
Tell him I'm not in; I've gone away.
- She's not in. She's gone away.
- Where has she gone?
He wants to know where you've gone.
Just tell him there's no forwarding address.
Sorry. There's no forwarding address.
- Was the funeral nice?
- It was very quiet. There wasn't anybody there except me.
- I wanted to come.
- Why didn't you?
I didn't think it was my place.
[Whistles]
- Good-bye, Miss Lynn.
- Thanks, Harry, for helping with the bags.
I don't want your money.
Now, give me those reports on Robin Ray and Larry Evans in the Lynn case.
[Man On Speaker] Yes, sir.
- Good morning, Chief.
- What do you want?
- Nothing much.
- Then get out of here and get to work.
You're falling down on this case, Cornell. You haven't got a thing so far.
- I got my suspicions.
- Suspicions? What good are suspicions without proof?
Now that Harry Williams is out of the running, we're no further along than we were.
I'll get something out of him; just give me time.
- I thought you said Williams didn't do it.
- I'm not talking about Williams.
- I'm talking about Frankie Christopher.
- Christopher. Christopher!
All you talk about is Christopher. What about some of the others?
That ham actor Robin Ray or Larry Evans, the newspaper columnist?
Let's sweat him.
Better leave the newspaperman alone till you get something solid.
- He might give you a bad notice. - All right.
Call in the actor.
- He couldn't kill mice.
- Did I ask for your opinion?
Bring in the actor now!
All right. I think you're wasting your time.
- Do you mind if I bring in Frankie Christopher too?
- What do you want him for?
- Have you got anything new? - No.
I just like to have him around.
- Hello, Robin.
- Oh, hello, Christopher.
- What are you doing down here?
- They asked me to come along.
I seem to be their favorite customer.
You know, it's perfectly ridiculous. I had nothing to do with this.
I just came down to be obliging.
How do they go about these things?
What do they do to you?
Oh, nothing much. It's sorta like playing handball, only you're the ball.
Say, you should've worn overalls.
- I'm afraid you're gonna get that suit all messed up.
- Are you serious?
- What do you think?
- This way, boys.
[Murmuring]
Follow me.
- No lights?
- You're lucky.
Go ahead. You're an actor. Pretend you're going to your execution.
Sit right over here, fellas.

Let me out!
Let me out of here!
Take him up to my office.
There was something so young, so fresh, so full of life... about Vicky that the very sight of her gave me new hope.
She made me feel that perhaps I might succeed again... in both my life and my profession.
But when I told her that, she just laughed at me. She told me I was a has-been.
She said she was going places and didn't want to hitch her wagon... to a... a falling star.
I even arranged for a screen test for both of us.
A director I knew said he would give us a chance.
But when the day came, she went down there alone.
They decided they didn't need me.
Well, I couldn't stand that. I went down there and started a row.
A few days later, when she sent for Christopher and Evans and me...
I pretended to them that I knew nothing about it.
I pretended to myself that I didn't care.
But I... I didn't kill her!
- Where were you on the day of the murder?
- I was in the sanitarium... on East 77th Street.
I go there occasionally when things get tough, and they take care of me.
- You can verify that if you like by calling the doctor.
- Check up on that.
I've already checked. He was there, all right.
So there goes another one of your suspects.
- Is that all for today, gentlemen?
- For today.
Hello, Frankie. I see they're still letting' you out of here.
- I come and go as I please. They made me a trustee.
- Cornell must be slipping.
According to my calendar, you should be in the death house by now.
Uh-oh.
- Well, if it isn't Operator 13.
- The nails for your coffin.
- Hi, Inspector.
- How about giving me a lift uptown, Frankie?
Sure. Always glad to oblige a ghoul. Right this way.
~ [Whistling Funeral March]
[Simulates Bomb Dropping]
- You can drop me at 58th and Madison. I live on the corner.
- Okay.
I'm sorry to have to ask you to do this, but I'm a little short on cash lately.
You see, I've spent so much of my own dough trying to build up this case against you.
Well, if there's anything you need, just let me know.
I imagine they'll make it right with me when I bring in the material for your trial.
They usually do in these cases. I nick a guy on my own time and send him up to the chair.
- Then I get back pay.
- Must be a great life.
Like a garbageman, only with people.
I got practically all the evidence I need now.
I could arrest you today, for that matter, but you might get some smart mouthpiece... and get off with life instead of the chair.
I won't be satisfied until I'm sure it's the chair.
You're a gay dog, Cornell. You make me feel as if I'm driving a hearse.
I know your type. I've seen hundreds of'em.
I don't scare you enough... to make you commit suicide, but I worry you just the same.
And when the day comes, they all act different.
Some scream. A few faint.
Some light a cigarette and try a wisecrack... but it sticks in their throats, especially when they're hung.
All right, Dracula. Get your rotten corpse out of that seat.
- Thanks.
- Not at all.
It won't be long now. Just a day or two.
[Water Running]
[Door Buzzer Buzzing]
[Buzzing Continues]
Good evening, Miss Lynn.
- What do you want?
- I just wanna ask you a few questions.
You've asked enough questions already. Now, go away.
Now, don't be like that, Miss Lynn.
You wanna find the man who killed your sister, don't you?
- Of course.
- Maybe I can help you.
Maybe you can help me. It's simply a matter of justice.
Nice little place you got here.
The garden of hope. Do you believe in hope, Miss Lynn?
Naturally. What's the good of living without hope?
It can be done.
Miss Lynn, I got a hunch you know more than you're telling me.
- Especially about Frankie Christopher.
- That's not true.
I've told you everything I know. What more could there be?
If I knew, I wouldn't be asking, would I?
Now, listen. I know what you're going through. But justice is justice.
That guy is a sham, and he played your sister for a sucker.
When she tried to run out on him, he let her have it.
I don't believe that.
- You're in love with him, aren't you?
- No, I'm not!
Yes, you are.
Your sister knew it, and I know it.
You're in love with him and trying to cover up his tracks, but it won't work.
I'll get him, with your help or without it.
I've never been wrong yet. That man's guilty.
If you know what's good for you, you'll play along with me.
- Get out of here!
- You keep telling yourself he's innocent, don't you?
But you're not certain. That's what's driving you crazy.
If you were certain, you wouldn't be holding out on me, would you?
Get out of here!
All right, Miss Lynn.
But think it over.
Get me Mr. Frank Christopher. Columbus 46738.
- Say, you look all right.
- Thanks.
- Where are we going?
- Well, first of all, we're going to the fights.
Frankie, do you really think we should?
Why not?
I've got nothing to be ashamed of.
- I know, but...
- Don't worry.
I'll take you in the gallery where the real fans go.
- [Crowd Shouting]
- Look at that boy go!
Attaboy, Lloyd!
Give it to 'im!
Give him your left! Let 'im have your left!
Give it to him again!
[Shouting, Indistinct]
[Shouting Continues]
- Was that good?
- Was it? It wasn't bad!
He looks so little. I don't know which is which.
I own a piece of the boy in the green pants.
Take it easy!
Take your time!
He's a great little kid. I raised him from a pup.
- Take it easy!
- Did you ever bring Vicky here?
Nope. She wasn't interested.
Go after him!
Don't stand there as if you're being milked!
Go after his stomach, you lug!
His stomach!
- Who was hit?
- Uh, the one in the green pants.
- What's he doing?
- Taking it easy on the floor.
- [Referee] Five, six...
- Foul!
Foul!
Well, anyway, he was a great little fighter.
- I thought he was fine.
- It was that clumsy referee.
He's nearsighted. We only keep him on out of charity.
- Hello, Frankie. How are ya?
- Hello, Gus. How's business?
- Ah, so-so.
- I love this neighborhood.
I was brought up here.
I even miss the "L." It used to sound like thunder.
- Did you ever bring Vicky down here?
- No. Vicky liked the nightclubs.
I've never been in a New York nightclub.
- What?
- No.
See, I've never known a man who had the cover charge.
Lady, we're going to fix that right now.
- Pegasus Club.
- Yes, sir.
- Hi, Frankie.
- Hello. How's tricks?
Not so good. I still got that ringing in my head.
That's too bad. Here. Get yourself a big dinner and see what happens.
- Thanks, Frankie.
- He used to be a pretty good heavyweight... but he's slaphappy now. - Keep punching'.
- Who's that?
He always hears the bell in his head.
He seemed to know you were going to give him that money.
Always do. I may be a has-been myself someday.
Perhaps this isn't wise, Frankie. Are you sure we oughta be seen together?
I was never so sure of anything in my life.
~ [Band]
Well, what do you know about that?
Pardon me, baby, while I go out and sink a battleship.
- Would you like to dance?
- No, thanks.
I don't feel like dancing.
Why did you suddenly call me tonight?
It's very simple.
I was lonely... and I thought you might possibly be lonely too.
- Is that all?
- Of course.
You know, I'm not sure I like being just another member of the Lonely Hearts Club.
You might do better by looking up the advertisements.
"Bachelor, $75,000, with two glass eyes."
The trouble with you is you pretend you don't care about things, but you do.
You were very upset by Vicky's death, weren't you?
Sure. If I could find the guy who did it...
I might save the state something on its electricity bill.
- She was a good kid.
- Did you love her?
No. Do you think if I had loved her...
I would've tried to exploit her the way I did?
Vicky was pretty, gay and amusing.
She had lots to offer, and I wanted to put her in the right place on the map.
After all, that's my business.
But when a man really loves a woman... he doesn't wanna plaster her face all over the papers and magazines.
He wants to keep her to himself, right in here.
[Pats Chest]
I never thought of that. I feel like dancing now.
~ [Continues]
Scrap the stuff about the Japanese spy with a Kodak and run this:
"What sister of what recently murdered girl... is stepping out with the dead girl's boyfriend?
Dancing on the grave, I call it.
The murderer has yet to be found."
- You dance well.
- Vicky said I was terrible.
Well, dancing... It sort of depends.
Yes, I... I know.
How'd you like your first New York nightclub?
Oh, it was wonderful. Especially the dancing.
Thanks. Where would you like to go now?
It's pretty late. Where do you usually go?
If I told you, you'd laugh.
Go ahead. I could use a good laugh.
- I go swimming.
- Swimming?
Where?
The Lido Plunge.
You see, when I was a kid on the East Side... it used to be the biggest adventure of my life... whenever I could save up a quarter and go to the Lido.
I never got enough of it. So, now that I'm in the chips...
I go swimming every chance I get.
[Chuckling] Anyway, it's healthy.
If you've got an extra quarter on you, I'd like to go along.
- Are you kidding?
- No.
You're on.
- Hello.
- Ouch. You hurt my eyes.
- Thanks, mister.
- Madame, could I interest you in a nice cold swim?
Funny, I was just going to ask you that.
Swell. Let's go.
Well, how do you like the old swimming hole?
- Wet and wonderful.
- This is my idea of real luxury.
You know, if I ever inherit a gold mine...
I'll have a swimming pool in every room... and you can swim in all of'em.
Do you tell that to every girl you bring down here?
So help me, I never brought a girl here in my life!
- Hi, Frankie!
- Hello.
- Well, here we are.
- It's been a wonderful evening.
Thanks. You've been swell.
Frankie, will you come upstairs a minute?
There's something of Vicky's I know she'd want you to have.
Sure.
It's a note you wrote to Vicky.
I found it among her things before the police arrived.
"Dear Vicky, after what you did last night... the sooner you're out of the way"...
- Did I write that?
- It's your signature.
Well, it was after that ride together.
What she said, it... it was so unfair to you.
I know what you meant, but I don't think anybody else would.
Why didn't you turn this in?
I didn't know until tonight.
It was when we were dancing.
I suddenly understood the letter and a lot of other things besides.
[Cornell] I'd like to have a look at that letter, if you don't mind.
"Dear Vicky, after what you did last night... the sooner you're out of the way, the better."
Nice of you to put in writin'.
All right, Murphy. You wait in the hall.
I knew you were holdin' somethin' back.
You're the Mona Lisa type. I can spot 'em a mile away.
- Oh!
- Jill!
- [Door Slams]
- Well, here we are, Frankie.
I've looked forward to this moment for a long time.
- You're trying to frame me.
- I don't have to frame you.
You frame yourself. How about this little note?
Anybody might've written a note like that. I was burned up.
Well, you're gonna have plenty of time to cool off before I'm through with you.
I found these in your room.
Exhibit "A," one pair of brass knuckles.
And Vicky was hit behind the ear with a weapon the size of a fist, only much harder.
It's a frame. You're trying to frame me!
You planted those, you... you...
[Groans]
"A frame." That's what they all say.
Murphy saw me take those knuckles from your bureau drawer.
[Frankie]Jill, you don't believe all this stuff, do you?
What does it matter what she believes? What does it matter what she believes?
You're like a rat in a box without any holes.
Well, they're gonna make a hole for you, Mr. Handsome Harry... 6-by-3, filled with quicklime...
You shouldn't have done that, Jill. It makes you an accomplice.
Quick, through the kitchen. There's a doorway leading to the hall.
Go on. Leave the cop to me.
Quick, Officer!
He's trying to escape!
He went through the bedroom!
Sorry for being so slow, but I don't do this sort of thing very often.
- You're going great.
- I hope the man doesn't mind our using his things.
I'll leave him a note of apology.
[Sawing Continues]
- You're a great sport, Jill.
- You're not so bad yourself.
- Why did you do it?
- I don't know.
But when I saw you standing there so helpless and that big fathead bullying you...
I just had to hit something.
Is that the only reason?
No.
I guess Vicky was right about us, wasn't she?
- Glad?
- [Sawing Stops]
What do you think?
Frankie, we've got to get out of this town as fast as we can.
Are you sure you wanna go through with it?
You know, it isn't very much fun being married to a hunted man.
I don't mind.
Besides, most married men have a hunted look anyway.
Frank!
First thing we gotta do in the morning is get some money.
I've got some laid away in a safe deposit box downtown.
- There'll be watching there, won't they?
- Not this one.
I put it away under my original name.
[Mouths Words] Frank, you're not really a crook, are you?
Of course not. I took the name Christopher because it's easy to spell.
- What's your real name?
- I hate to tell you.
You've got to tell me if I'm gonna use it.
Okay. Botticelli.
Botticelli. Mrs. Botticelli.
Why, that's not bad at all.
What are we going to do in the meantime?
I'm going to show you how to play hide-and-seek in the big city.
- ~ [Film:
Piano] - [Snoring]
- [Sighs] Frankie?
- Yes?
How many times do we have to see this?
Don't tell me you're getting tired of it already?
- I'm just beginning to get warmed up.
- [Sighs]
Nobody seems to be particularly interested in it except you.
[Snoring Continues]
Probably waiting for the revolution.
Put your shoes on, sister.
If I had to see that picture once more, I think I'd rather give myself up.
I don't blame you. Now, listen.
I want you to wait for me in the public library until I get the money.
- Why can't I come with you?
- I think it's better that we separate for the time being.
- You'll be safer there.
- [Scoffs] What makes you think that's safe?
Nobody in their right mind is ever in a public library at 9:00.
And if anything does go wrong, you meet me here.
- Now, be careful.
- All right.
[Man] All right, young lady. Come along with us.
- What have you done to Frankie?
- Never mind about that.
- Come along.
- You haven't hurt him, have you?
- [Bangs]
- Can't you people read?
Sorry, pops.
Stick around.

Hello, Frankie.
- Carrying a gun?
- Who can tell?
It may be a gun or it may be a pipe.
Then again, it may be just my finger.
But you're not taking any chances, are you?
No. I don't have to.
- What's on your mind, Frankie?
- You've taken Jill.
She hasn't got anything to do with this.
- Let her go, and I'll give myself up.
- [Chuckles]
You've turned into quite the young Lochenvar, haven't you?
Self-sacrifice and everything.
It's no use. I don't have to make bargains with you.
I'll get you eventually. If not tomorrow, next week.
If not next week, next year.
Time's nothing in my life. It is in yours.
Each minute's an eternity to a man in your shoes.
You got the wrong steer this time, Cornell.
They told me at headquarters that you're a pretty sure thing.
But this time you're trying to convict an innocent man.
That's what you say, but you can't sell me on it.
I'll follow you into your grave. I'll write my name on your tombstone.
You're not a cop looking for a murderer.
You're crazy, Cornell. You ought to be put away.
Sure. Why don't you call a policeman?
All right, Cornell. But I'll tell you one thing.
You're never going to convict me. You'll have to kill me first.
[Scoffs] I wouldn't kill anybody.
I'm too smart. Look. I don't even carry a gun.
- I wouldn't touch you with sterilized gloves.

Slayer at large!

- Hello, Chief.
- Hello.
Got a lead on Christopher yet?
Did you ever read The Sex Life of the Butterfly by Faber?
- Cornell, are you crazy?
- [Chuckles] That's funny.
That's the second time I've been asked that question tonight. Have a Tootsie Roll.
What in blazes does The Sex Life of the Butterfly got to do with the Lynn case?
Faber was a naturalist.
He got himself a very rare female butterfly from Africa worth 1,000 bucks.
He kept it in a glass box in his apartment in Paris.
But nobody had ever been able to catch the male of the species.
One day, he let the female out of the box... and in a few hours, he had 10,000 dollars' worth... of rare African butterflies flying around the room.
Very interesting. Very interesting indeed!
But what's all this got to do with the Lynn case, may I ask?
I want a release order for the girl.
Just let her out of the box. Nature will do the rest.
We'll have Frankie in the net by tomorrow.
Yeah, you may be right at that.
But if you slip up this time, Cornell... it's curtains to a brilliant career.
You realize that, of course?
Sure. I realize that more than you do.
~ [Film: Piano]
~ [Film:

- Frankie!
- Jill, what are you doing here?
- How did you get out?
- They let me out.
Oh, they would, so you could lead them right to me.
I wasn't a Campfire Girl for nothing. They think I'm still in the apartment.
Yeah?
Well, we're getting out of town right now.
Wait a minute. I found something.
These cards... They were on the flowers that were sent to Vicky's funeral.
- Who were they from?
- I don't know.
Maybe we won't have to leave town after all.
You wait here.
[Knocking]
Good evening. I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm from the Evening Ledger.
They sent me out here on an assignment. May I come in?
Sure. Sure. Come in.
You know, I'm glad to see anybody that's still moving around.
Well, what can I do for you?
I've been assigned to write a human interest story on Vicky Lynn.
I was wondering whether you could help me.
Any colorful or unusual... little incident connected with the funeral, for instance.
Lynn, Lynn. Let me see.
That's the girl was murdered up on 76th Street, isn't it?
- That's right.
- Well, I don't know much I can tell you.
Only thing... We got our orders and laid her away the same as anybody else.
- Has anybody been out here since?
- No.
- Were there many flowers at the funeral?
- No. Just the...
Wait a minute.
Lynn, Lynn. 266.
Say, that grave's been getting flowers every day since she died.
- Who'd they come from?
- I don't know.
Never was any signature on the card.
Just come regular from some florist around Times Square.
Name Carting or Keating or something like that.
- Do you have a telephone directory?
- Sure.
Over there. Help yourself.
I usually like to oblige newspaper people... but in this case I'm between two fires.
Then the man who's been sending the flowers is also from a newspaper?
Well, in a way, yes, but he isn't a reporter.
- Does he write a column?
- Well, I can't say that, can I... or else I'd give it away?
Thanks, Mr. Keating. I think I get your drift.
Now, don't get me in any trouble.
- Who is it?
- Your columnist friend.
[Snoring]
[Grunts]
[Clears Throat]
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.
What's the idea of breaking into my place like this in the middle of the night?
What do you know about the death of Vicky Lynn?
You're a fine one to ask that. I know nothing about it.
Then why have you been sending flowers to her grave every day?
Oh, so you've found out about that, have you?
- I can explain that easily.
- Then go ahead.
- I promised her.
- Promised her?
- Yes. Mind if I smoke?
- Not at all.
- You won't need that.
- I just thought I'd try it.
It'd be a great scoop for me if I could bring you in myself.
So you think I'm guilty too?
Yes, and so does everybody else.
What do you mean you promised to send Vicky flowers?
Well, the day of the murder, I had driven Vicky to the station to get her train reservations.
You mean you were with Vicky the afternoon she was killed?
- Yes.
- Then why didn't you tell that to the police?
Because I'm not a fool. You told the police your story.
- What'd it get you?
- Never mind that. Go on.
When we got back to the apartment, she had forgotten her key.
She asked me if I had the one she gave me... and I told her I had raffled it off.
Oh, dear, the passkey's gone too.
I guess there's nothing to do but sit and wait... for the switchboard boy to get back.
From what I've seen of that boy, he may be gone for hours.
I'd better climb up the fire escape and let you in myself.
Why, Larry, you'd never do anything so gallant.
You don't know me.
- There you are, milady.
- Larry, you're so sweet.
You know, uh, now that I'm leaving, I'm really a little unhappy about it.
Oh, forget it.
If I weren't sure I'd be a success, I'd... well, I'd never do a thing like this.
I'm sure you'll be a success. You've got a heart made out of rock candy.
- You won't forget me, will you?
- I won't for at least two weeks.
- Two weeks isn't very long, is it?
- It is for a columnist.
I'll tell you what I'll do. For the first two weeks, I'll send you flowers every day.
It'll make a great impression where you're going.
Oh, Larry, will you really?
- Promise?
- I promise.
A promise is a promise.
I hope it still makes an impression... wherever she is.
- I think it smells. What did you do after that?
- I left.
Was the boy at the switchboard when you came down?
No. No, I remember the board was buzzing as I passed by.
Did you notice anything unusual about the room when you went in?
Yeah, now that you mention it. There seemed to be the smell of cigarette smoke in the air.
I thought maybe Jill had just left or...
Jill was at the office.
Good grief. You don't think he did it, do you?
Now, do you understand what you have to do?
- Give me a half hour, then telephone him.
- Frankie, I'm scared.
- Don't do it, please!
- This is the only chance I have.
I've gotta take it.
Good luck, dear.
Hold still. I'd hate to put a hole in you.
Put that gun away, Frankie. We've got enough against you as it is.
Not until you've heard me out. I got a lead on the real killer, but I need your help.
Sorry, Frankie. I'm on the other side of the fence.
Okay, then. I'll make you a sporting proposition.
You trust me for just a half an hour, and I'll trust you.
Well, I guess a half hour won't do any harm.
- But I'll take that just in case.
- Come on.
[Switchboard Buzzing]
[Buzzing Stops]
[Jill] Hello, Harry. This is Vicky.
[Buzzing Resumes]
[Buzzing Continues]
[Buzzing Stops, Resumes]
[Buzzing Stops]
Harry, this is Vicky!
Why did you do it, Harry?
Didn't you love me?
No!
No!
[Whimpering]
[Sobbing]
Why did you do it?
- Come on now. Own up.
- I won't tell you.
- I won't tell you!
- You loved her, didn't you?
Go away!
Leave me alone!
You let yourself in with your passkey and waited for her in the apartment.
When Evans came through the window to let her in, you hid in the closet.
After he left, you came out. You tried to grab her, and she screamed.
- You became frightened and killed her.
- I didn't know what I was doin'.
I swear. She screamed, and I lost my head!
Sure. Sure, I understand.
- Do ya? Do ya?
- Sure.
I told a cop how it was when he traced me to Brooklyn.
He said he understood too.
So he told me just to come back here and keep quiet, and he'd forget all about it.
- What cop?
- Why, the big one.
- Ed Cornell? - That's the one.
Did you hear that, Mac?
Cornell knew I was innocent all the time.
[Switchboard Buzzing]
[Buzzing Stops]
Yes?
Yes, Jill. Everything's all right. He came through.
Oh, Frankie, I'm so glad. I'll be right down.
Mac, I want one more favor...
Five minutes alone with Cornell.
Okay, Frankie. I guess you got it comin' to you.
[Footsteps]
[Lock Clicking]
Hello, Cornell.
I hope you don't mind my breaking in on you like this.
Have you come to give yourself up?
I don't have to. I just had a long talk with Harry Williams.
That must have been very enlightening.
Yes. Very enlightening.
I'm a sick man, Frankie.
- At your soul, Cornell.
- Maybe.
You knew Williams was the one that killed Vicky all the time.
- Sure. I'm not dumb.
- You knew it, and yet you wanted to fry me.
- That's right.
Why didn't you go after Williams?
He was the one that killed her.
I lost Vicky long before Williams killed her.
You were the one who took her away from me, not him.
Don't make me laugh!
Yeah.
I guess it must seem funny to you... a worm like me looking up to a woman like that.
I followed her around for months before I got up enough courage to speak to her.
I used to hang around the restaurant at night... to see that she got home all right.
Then finally, I got a chance to help her.
It was New Year's Eve.
Two guys tried to get fresh with her, so I stepped in.
She seemed... really grateful and...
We had a cup of coffee together.
I saw her several times after that, and it was always the same.
She took me on my own ground.
Then I started to hope that we might get to know each other better... that I might even get up enough courage to ask her to... marry me someday.
I... took this apartment... started to furnish it.
Bought the perfume she liked.
I intended to surprise her with it.
Then you came along with your grand plans of makin' somethin' of her!
Puttin' ideas into her head that she was a glamour girl and all that kind of stuff!
Why didn't you leave her alone?
She started gettin' too good for me.
I felt like a fool with this apartment.
I could've killed you then, Christopher.
Why didn't you?
Because I had the hook in your mouth, and I wanted to see you suffer.
Well, it's all over now, Cornell. You're going to be put away.
Yeah, but not where you think.
The guy who sold me this medicine... told me it would cure everything.
[Jill] Frankie!
Frankie, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Come on. Let's get outta here.
~ [Band]
Robin, I...
Why, who on earth is that beautiful girl?
Mrs. Botticelli.
- I never saw her before in my life.
- I don't know either.
They're both strangers to me.
Yes, sweetheart?
There's a girl wants to see you.
Her name's Wonderly.
A customer? I guess so. You'll want to see her, anyway.
She's a knockout. Shoo her in, Effie, darling.
Will you come in, Miss Wonderly?
Won't you sit down, Miss Wonderly?
Thank you. I inquired at the hotel for the name of a reliable private detective.
They mentioned yours.
Suppose you tell me about it from the very beginning.
I'm from New York. I'm trying to find my sister.
I have reason to believe that she's here in San Francisco with a man by the name of Thursby, Floyd Thursby.
I don't know where she met him.
We've never been as close as sisters ought to be.
If we had, perhaps Corinne would have told me that she was planning on running away with him.
Mother and Father are in Honolulu. It would kill them.
I've got to find her before they get back home.
They're coming home the first of the month. You've had word of your sister?
A letter from her about two weeks ago.
It said nothing except that she was all right.
I sent her a telegram, begging her to come home.
I sent it to General Delivery here.
That was the only address she gave me.
I waited a week and no answer came, so I decided to come out here myself.
I wrote her that I was coming. I shouldn't have done that, should I?
It's not always easy to know what to do.
You haven't found her? No. I told her in my letter that I'd be at the St. Mark and for her to meet me there.
I waited three whole days.
She didn't come.
Didn't even send a message. It was horrible, waiting.
I sent her another letter to General Delivery.
Yesterday afternoon, I went to the post office.
Corinne didn't call for her mail, but Floyd Thursby did.
He wouldn't tell me where Corinne was.
He said she didn't want to see me.
I can't believe that.
He promised to bring her to the hotel, if she'd come, this evening.
He said he knew she wouldn't. He promised to come himself if she didn't.
Excuse me.
It's all right, Miles.
Come in. Miss Wonderly, my partner, Miles Archer.
Miss Wonderly's sister ran away from New York with a fellow named Floyd Thursby.
They're here in San Francisco.
Miss Wonderly has seen Thursby and has a date to meet him tonight.
Maybe he'll bring the sister with him.
The chances are he won't. Miss Wonderly wants us to find the sister, get her away from him and back home.
Right?
Now, it's simply a matter of having a man at the hotel this evening to shadow him when he leads us to your sister.
If, after we've found her, she still doesn't want to leave him, well, we have ways of managing that.
Yeah. But you must be careful.
I'm deathly afraid of him, of what he might do.
She's so young, and his bringing her here from New York is such a serious...
Mightn't he do something to her?
Now, just leave that to us. We'll know how to handle him.
But I want you to know he's a dangerous man.
I honestly don't think he'd stop at anything.
I don't think he'd hesitate to kill Corinne if he thought it would save him.
Could he cover up by marrying her?
He has a wife and three children in England.
Yes, they usually do, though not always in England.
What's he look like? He has dark hair and thick, bushy eyebrows.
He talks in a loud, blustery manner.
He gives the impression of being a violent person.
He was wearing a light gray suit and a gray hat when I saw him this morning.
What does he do for a living?
I haven't the faintest idea.
What time's he coming to see you?
After 8:00. All right, Miss Wonderly. We'll have a man there.
I'll look after it myself.
Thank you.
Oh, yes.
Will that be enough?
Thank you.
It'll help some if you meet Thursby in the lobby.
I will. You don't have to look for me.
I'll see you all right.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
They're right enough.
They have brothers in her bag.
What do you think of her?
She's sweet.
Maybe you saw her first, Sam, but I spoke first.
You've got brains.
Yes, you have.
Hello?
Yeah.
Miles Archer dead?
Where?
Bush and Stockton?
Yeah.
In 15 minutes.
Thanks.
Hello, Effie?
It's me.
Now, listen, precious.
Miles has been shot.
Yeah, dead.
Now, don't get excited.
Yeah.
Now, you'll have to break the news to Iva.
I'd fry first. And keep her away from me.
That's a good girl.
Now get right over there.
You're an angel.
Bye.
What do you want here?
I'm Sam Spade. Tom Polhaus phoned.
I didn't know you at first. They're back there.
Hello, Sam.
I figured you'd want to see it before we took him away.
Thanks, Tom.
What happened?
Got him right through the pump with this.
It's a Webley.
English, ain't it?
Yeah. A Webley Fosbery .45 automatic, 8 shot.
They don't make them anymore.
How many gone out of it?
Just one. Let's see. Shot up here, huh?
Standing like you are, with his back to the fence.
The man who shot him stood here.
Went over backwards, taking the top of the fence with him, and went on down the hill and got caught on that rock.
That it? That's it. The blast burnt his coat.
Who found him?
Man on the beat.
Anybody hear the shot?
Somebody must've.
We just got here.
You want to go down and have a look at him before we take him away?
No, you've seen everything I could.
His gun was still tucked away on his hip. Hadn't been fired.
His overcoat was buttoned.
I found a $100 bill in his vest pocket and 30 some bucks in his pants.
Was he working, Sam?
Well?
He was tailing a guy named Thursby.
What for?
He wanted to find out where he lived.
Don't crowd me, Tom.
I'm going on down and break the news to Miles' wife.
It's tough, him getting it like that, ain't it?
Miles had his faults, just like any of the rest of us, but I guess he must've had some good points, too, huh?
I guess so.
Miss Wonderly, please.
Checked out?
What time?
Any forwarding address?
Thanks.
Hello, Tom.
Hello, Lieutenant.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Drink?
Did you break the news to Miles' wife, Sam?
How'd she take it?
I don't know anything about women.
Since when? What kind of a gun do you carry?
None. I don't like them.
Course, there are some at the office.
You don't happen to have one here?
You sure about that?
Look around. Turn the dump upside down if you want to.
I won't squawk if you got a search warrant.
We don't want to make any...
I don't like this!
Why are you birds sucking around here for?
Tell me or get out. You can't treat us like that, Sam.
It ain't right. We got our work to do.
Why were you tailing Thursby?
I wasn't. Miles was and for the simple reason we had a client...
Who's the client?
Sorry, I can't tell you that.
Be reasonable, Sam.
Give us a break, will you?
How we gonna turn up anything on Miles' killing if you don't tell us what you got?
Tom says you were in too much of a hurry to even stop and take a look at your dead partner.
And you didn't go to Archer's house to tell his wife.
We called your office and the girl there said you told her to do it.
I'll give you 10 minutes to get to a phone and do your talking to the girl.
I'll give you 10 minutes to get to Thursby's joint,
Geary and Leavenworth.
You could do it easily in that time.
What's your boyfriend getting at, Tom?
Just this, Thursby was shot down in front of his hotel about a half an hour after you left Bush Street.
Keep your paws off me.
What time did you get home?
Just a few minutes ahead of you.
I was walking around thinking things over.
We know you weren't here.
We tried to get you on the phone.
Where did you walk to?
Up Bush Street.
Did you see anybody...
No. No witnesses.
Well, I know where I stand, now.
Sorry I got up on my hind legs, boys, but you fellas trying to rope me made me nervous.
Miles getting bumped off upset me, and then you birds cracking foxy.
But it's all right now, now that I know what it's all about.
Forget it, Sam.
Thursby die? Yeah.
How'd I kill him?
I forget.
He was shot in the back four times with a .44 or .45 from across the street.
Nobody saw it, but that's how it figures.
Hotel people know anything about him?
Nothing, except that he lived there a week.
Alone?
Yeah, alone.
Did you find out who he was?
What his game was? Well, did you?
We thought you could tell us that.
I've never seen Thursby, dead or alive.
Well, you know me, Spade.
If you did it, or if you didn't, you'll get a square deal from me and most of the breaks.
Don't know as I'd blame you much.
The man that killed your partner...
But that won't stop me from nailing you.
Fair enough.
But I'd feel better about it if you'd have a drink with me.
Success to crime.
She's in there.
I told you to keep her away from me.
Yes, but you didn't tell me how.
Don't be cranky with me, Sam.
I've had her all night.
Sorry, angel.
I didn't mean...
Hello, Iva.
Sam.
Darling.
Effie take care of everything?
I think so.
Sam, did you kill him?
Who put that bright idea in your head?
Well, I thought you said if it wasn't for Miles, you'd...
Be kind to me, Sam.
"You killed my husband, Sam.
Be kind to me."
Don't, Iva. Don't.
You shouldn't have come here today, darling.
You ought to be home.
You'll come soon?
Soon as I can.
Goodbye, Iva.
Well, how did you and the widow make out?
She thinks I shot Miles.
So you could marry her?
The cops think I killed Thursby, the guy Miles was tailing for that Wonderly dame.
Who do you think I shot?
Are you going to marry Iva?
Don't be silly. I wish I'd never laid eyes on her.
Do you suppose she could have killed him?
You're an angel.
A nice, rattlebrained, little angel.
Oh, am I?
Thanks, honey.
Suppose I told you that your Iva hadn't been home many minutes when I arrived to break the news at 3:00 this morning?
Are you telling me?
She kept me waiting at the door while she undressed.
Her clothes were on a chair where she'd dumped them, hat and coat underneath.
Her slip, on top, was still warm.
She'd wrinkled up the bed, but the wrinkles weren't mashed down.
You're a detective, darling, but she didn't kill him.
Do the police really think you shot this what's his name?
Do they? Look at me, Sam.
You worry me.
You always think you know what you're doing, but you're too slick for your own good.
Someday you're going to find it out. Spade and Archer.
Yes, Miss Wonderly.
Hello?
Yeah, this is Sam Spade.
Where?
Coronet Apartments, California Avenue, apartment 1001.
What's the name?
Okay, I'll be right over.
Have Miles' desk moved out of the office and have "Spade and Archer" taken off all the doors and windows and have "Samuel Spade" put on.
Come in, Mr. Spade.
Everything's upside down.
I haven't finished unpacking.
Mr. Spade, I...
I have a terrible, terrible confession to make.
That story I told you yesterday was just a story.
Oh, that.
Well, we didn't exactly believe your story, Miss...
What is your name, Wonderly or LeBlanc?
It's really O'Shaughnessy. Brigid O'Shaughnessy.
We didn't exactly believe your story, Miss O'Shaughnessy.
We believed your $200.
You mean that...
I mean you paid us more than if you'd been telling us the truth and enough more to make it all right.
Tell me, Mr. Spade, am I to blame for last night?
You warned us that Thursby was dangerous.
Of course, you lied to us about your sister and all that, but that didn't count.
We didn't believe you.
No, I wouldn't say that you were at fault.
Thank you.
Mr. Archer was so alive yesterday, so solid and hearty, and...
Stop it. He knew what he was doing.
Those are the chances we take.
Was he married?
Yeah, with $10,000 insurance, no children and a wife that didn't like him.
Please don't.
That's the way it was.
Anyway, there's no time for worrying about that now.
Out there's a flock of policemen and assistant district attorneys running around with their noses to the ground.
Mr. Spade, do they know about me?
Not yet.
I've been stalling them until I could see you.
Do they have to know about me?
I mean, can't you shield me so that I won't have to answer their questions?
Maybe, but I gotta know what it's all about.
I can't tell you.
I can't tell you now.
I will later, when I can.
You've got to trust me, Mr. Spade.
I'm so alone and afraid.
I've got nobody to help me if you won't help me.
Be generous, Mr. Spade.
You're brave. You're strong.
You can spare me some of that courage and strength, surely.
Help me, Mr. Spade. I need help so badly.
I have no right to ask you. I know I haven't, but I do ask you.
Help me.
You won't need much of anybody's help.
You're good.
It's chiefly your eyes, I think, and that throb you get in your voice when you say things like, "Be generous, Mr. Spade."
I deserve that.
But the lie was in the way I said it, not at all in what I said.
It's my own fault if you can't believe me now.
Now you are dangerous.
But I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to be of much help to you unless I've got some idea what it's all about.
For instance, I've gotta have some sort of a line on your Floyd Thursby.
I met him in the Orient.
We came here from Hong Kong last week. He promised to help me.
He took advantage of my dependence on him to betray me.
Betray you?
How? Why did you want him shadowed?
I wanted to find out how far he'd gone, whom he was meeting, things like that.
Did he kill Archer?
Certainly.
He had a Luger in his shoulder holster. Archer wasn't shot with a Luger.
Mr. Spade, you don't think I had anything to do with the death of Mr. Archer?
Did you?
No.
That's good.
Floyd always carried an extra revolver in his overcoat pocket.
Why all the guns?
He lived by them.
The story in Hong Kong is that he first came to the Orient as bodyguard to a gambler who'd had to leave the States.
The gambler had since disappeared, and Floyd knew about the disappearance.
I don't know.
I do know he always went heavily armed, and that he never went to sleep without covering the floor around his bed with crumpled newspapers so that nobody could come silently into his room.
You picked a nice sort of a playmate.
Only that sort could have helped me, if he'd been loyal.
How bad a spot are you actually in?
Bad as could be.
Physical danger?
I'm not heroic. I don't think there's anything worse than death.
Then it's that?
It's that, as surely as we're sitting here.
Unless you help me.
Who killed Thursby, your enemies or his?
I don't know.
His, I suppose.
I'm afraid. I don't know.
This is hopeless.
I don't know what you want done.
I don't even know if you know what you want done.
You won't go to the police? Go to them?
All I got to do is stand still, and they'll be swarming all over me.
All right, I'll tell them all I know, and you'll have to take your chances.
You've been patient with me. You've tried to help me.
It's useless and hopeless, I suppose.
I do thank you for what you've done.
I'll have to take my chances.
How much money have you got?
I've got about $500 left.
Give it to me.
There's only $400 here.
I had to keep some to live on.
Well, can't you get some more?
No. Haven't you got anything you can raise some money on?
I've got some furs and a little jewelry.
You'll have to hock them.
There you are.
I'll be back as soon as I can with the best news I can manage.
I'll ring four times, long, short, long, short.
And no, you needn't bother to come to the door.
I'll let myself in.
Anything stirring?
Did you send the flowers?
You're invaluable, darling.
Say, get my lawyer on the phone, will you?
Hello, Sid?
I think I'm going to have to tell a coroner to go to blazes, Sid.
Hey, can I hide behind the sanctity of my client's identity, secrets and what nots all the same, priest or lawyer?
Yeah, I know, but Dundy's getting a little rambunctious, and maybe it is a bit thick this time.
Yeah. What'll it cost to be on the safe side?
Well, maybe it's worth it.
Okay, go ahead.
Gardenia.
Quick, darling, in with him.
Will you come in, Mr. Cairo?
Will you sit down, Mr. Cairo?
Thank you, sir.
Now, what can I do for you, Mr. Cairo?
May a stranger offer condolences for your partner's unfortunate death?
Thanks.
Is there, Mr. Spade, as the newspapers imply, a certain relationship between that unfortunate happening and the death a little later of the man Thursby?
I beg your pardon. No.
More than idle curiosity prompted my question.
See, Mr. Spade, I'm trying to recover an ornament that, shall we say, has been mislaid.
I thought and hoped you could assist me.
The ornament is a statuette, a black figure of a bird.
I am prepared to pay, on behalf of the figure's rightful owner, the sum of $5,000 for its recovery.
I am prepared to promise that, what is the phrase?
No questions will be asked.
$5,000 is a lot of money.
Yes, Effie?
No, that'll be all.
Just be sure to lock the door behind you on your way out.
Good night.
$5,000 is...
You will clasp your hands together at the back of your neck.
I intend to search your offices, Mr. Spade.
I warn you, if you attempt to prevent me, I shall certainly shoot you.
Go ahead and search.
Will you please come to the center of the room?
I have to make certain that you are not armed.
PASSPORT Joel Cairo
FRENCH REPUBLIC PASSPORT
Look what you did to my shirt.
Sorry.
But imagine my embarrassment when I found out that $5,000 offer was just hooey.
Mr. Spade, my offer is genuine.
I am prepared to pay $5,000 for the figure's return.
Do you have it?
But if it isn't here, why did you risk serious injury to prevent my searching for it?
Why should I sit around here and let people come in and stick me up?
But certainly it is only natural that I try to save the owner such a considerable expense, if possible.
Who is he?
Mr. Spade, you'll forgive my not answering that question.
Yeah, well, I think we'd be better off all around if we'd put our cards on the table.
No, I do not think it would be better.
You see, Mr. Spade, if you know more than I do, then I shall profit by your knowledge.
So will you, to the extent of $5,000.
There's nothing like $5,000 here.
You want some assurance of my sincerity?
A retainer?
Would that do?
It might.
You will take, say, $100?
No.
I will take, say, $200.
Now, let's see, your first guess was that I had the bird.
There's nothing to that.
What's your second guess?
That you know where it is, or at least you know it is where you can get it.
You're not hiring me to do any murders or burglaries, but simply to get it back if possible, in an honest, lawful way?
If possible.
But in any case, with discretion.
When you wish to contact me, sir, I'm staying at the Hotel Belvedere, room 635.
I sincerely expect the greatest mutual benefit from our association, Mr. Spade.
May I please have my gun, now?
Oh, sure. I'd forgotten all about it.
Will you please clasp your hands together at the back of your neck?
I intend to search your offices.
Well, I'll be...
Why, sure.
Go ahead. I won't stop you.
Turn to the right and go up the hill, driver. Okay.
Mr. Spade.
Do you bring any news?
I mean, did you manage it so that the police won't have to know about me?
Well, they won't for a while, anyway.
You are wonderful. You won't get into any trouble, will you?
I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble.
Do sit down.
You aren't exactly the sort of a person you pretend to be, are you?
Why, I'm not sure I know exactly what you mean.
The schoolgirl manner. You know, blushing, stammering and all that.
I haven't lived a good life.
Worse than you could know.
Yeah, well, that's good, because if you actually were as innocent as you pretend to be, we'd never get anywhere.
I won't be innocent.
By the way, I saw Joel Cairo tonight.
Do you know him?
You're good.
You're very good.
What did he say?
About what?
About me.
Nothing. What did you talk about then?
He offered me $5,000 for the black bird.
You're not going to go around the room straightening things and poking the fire again, are you?
No, I'm not.
What did you say?
I said $5,000 was a lot of money.
It is.
It's more than I can ever offer you if I have to bid for your loyalty.
That's good coming from you.
What have you ever given me beside money?
You ever given me any of your confidence, any of the truth?
Haven't you tried to buy my loyalty with money and nothing else?
What else is there I can buy you with?
I don't care what your secrets are, but I can't go ahead without more confidence in you than I've got now.
You've got to convince me that you know what this is all about, that you aren't just fiddling around, hoping it'll all come out right in the end.
Can't you trust me a little longer?
How much is a little?
What are you waiting for?
I've got to talk to Joel Cairo.
You can see him tonight. He's at the theater.
It'll be out soon.
I'll leave a message at his hotel.
He can't come here.
I can't let him know where I am.
I'm afraid. My place, then.
Hello?
I want to leave a message for Joel Cairo.
You know, I never would've placed myself in this position if I didn't trust you completely.
That again?
Do you know that's true, though?
You don't have to trust me, so long as you can persuade me to trust you.
But don't worry about that now.
He'll be along any minute.
You get your business with Cairo over with, then we'll see how we stand.
And you'll let me go about it with him in my own way?
Sure.
You are a godsend.
Well, now don't overdo it.
Mr. Spade, there is a boy outside. He seems to be watching the house.
Yeah, I know.
I spotted him.
What?
What's that? What boy?
I don't know. A kid. He's been trailing me all evening.
Did he follow you to my apartment? No.
I shook him long before that.
Come in, Mr. Cairo.
I'm delighted to see you again, madam.
I was sure you would be, Joel.
Mr. Spade told me about your offer for the Falcon.
How soon can you have the money ready?
The money is ready.
In cash?
Yes.
You're ready to pay $5,000 if we turn over the Falcon to you?
Excuse me, please.
I must have expressed myself badly.
I did not mean to say that I have the money in my pocket, but that I am ready to get it for you on a few minutes' notice, anytime during banking hours.
That's probably true.
He only had a couple of hundred on him when I searched him late this afternoon at my office.
I shall be able to have the money for you at, say, 10:30 in the morning.
But I haven't got the Falcon.
I'll have it in another week at the most, though.
Then where is it?
Where Floyd hid it.
Floyd hid...
And you know where he hid it?
Then why do we have to wait a week?
Perhaps not a whole week.
And why, if I may ask another question, are you willing to sell it to me?
Because I'm afraid.
After what happened to Floyd, I'm afraid to touch it, except to turn it over to somebody else.
What exactly did happen to Floyd?
The fat man.
Fat man.
Is he here? I don't know.
I suppose so.
What difference does it make?
It might make a world of difference.
But, shall we add, more certainly the boy outside? Or you or me.
Precisely.
Yes.
But you might be able to get around him, Joel, as you did the one in Istanbul.
What was his name?
You mean the one you couldn't get to come to...
This is the second time that you have laid hands on me.
When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it.
Who's that?
I don't know. Keep quiet.
Hello.
You guys pick swell hours to do your visiting in.
What is it this time?
We want to talk to you, Spade.
Well, go ahead and talk.
We don't have to do it out here in the hall, do we, Sam?
You can't come in.
Come off it now, Sam.
You aren't trying to strong arm me, are you, Tom?
Why don't you be reasonable?
It would pay you to play along with us a little, Spade.
You got away with this, and you got away with that, but you can't keep it up forever.
Stop me when you can.
That's what I intend to do.
There's talk going around about you and Archer's wife.
Is there anything to it?
Not a thing.
The talk is that she tried to get a divorce from him so she could put in with you, and he wouldn't give it to her.
Anything to that?
No. There's even talk that that's why he was put on the spot.
Don't be a hog, Dundy.
Your first idea that I killed Thursby because he killed Miles falls to pieces if you blame me for killing Miles, too.
You haven't heard me say you killed anybody.
You're the one that keeps bringing that up.
Haven't you anything better to do than to keep popping in here early every morning, asking a lot of fool questions?
And getting a lot of lying answers.
Take it easy.
If you say there's nothing between you and Archer's wife, you're a liar and I'm telling you so.
Is that the hot tip that brought you up here at this ungodly hour of the night?
That's one of them.
And the other?
Let us in.
All right, Spade, we'll go.
Maybe you're right in bucking us. Think it over.
Help!
I guess we're going in.
I guess you are.
What's going on in here?
Look, Officer!
Look what she did!
Did you do that?
I had to. I was alone in here with him. He tried to attack me.
I had to keep him off.
I couldn't bring myself to shoot him.
You dirty, filthy liar!
You... It isn't true!
I came up here in good faith, and then both of them attacked me.
And then when he went out to talk to you, he left her here with a pistol.
And she said as soon as you leave, they are going to kill me, so I called for help because I didn't want you to leave me and be murdered.
And then she struck me with a pistol!
Why don't you make him tell the truth?
Behave yourself, sister.
That's no way to act.
Well, Tom, I don't guess we'll be wrong running the lot of them in.
Don't be in a hurry, boys. Everything can be explained.
I'll bet.
Miss O'Shaughnessy, may I present
Lieutenant Dundy and Detective Sergeant Polhaus?
Miss O'Shaughnessy is an operative in my employ since yesterday.
That's a lie, too.
That is Mr. Joel Cairo.
Cairo was an acquaintance of Thursby's.
He came into my office late this afternoon and hired me to find something that Thursby was supposed to have on him when he was bumped off.
It looked funny to me the way he put it, so I wouldn't touch it.
Then he pulled a gun on me.
Well, that's neither here nor there, unless we start preferring charges against each other.
Anyway, Miss O'Shaughnessy and I discussed the matter, and we decided to find out exactly how much he knew about Miles' and Thursby's killings, so we asked him to come up here.
Now, maybe we did put the questions to him a little roughly.
You know how that is, Lieutenant.
But we didn't hurt him enough to make him cry for help.
Well, what have you got to say to that?
I don't know what to say.
Try telling the facts.
What? Facts?
Quit stalling.
All you have to do is swear out a complaint they took a poke at you, and I'll throw them in the can.
Go ahead, Cairo.
Tell him, he'll do it.
Then we'll swear out a complaint against you, and he'll have the lot of us.
Get your hats.
Well, boys and girls, we put it over nicely.
Go on, get your hats.
Don't you know when you're being kidded?
No, but that can wait till we get down to the hall.
Wake up, Dundy, you're being kidded.
When I heard the buzzer, I said to Miss O'Shaughnessy and Cairo here,
I said, "There's the police again.
They're getting to be a nuisance.
"When you hear them going, one of you scream,
"and then we'll see how far along we can string them until they tumble."
Stop it, Sam!
That cut on his head. How did that get there?
Ask him.
Maybe he cut himself shaving.
The cut? No.
When we pretended to be struggling for the gun, I fell over the carpet.
I fell. Horsefeathers.
Take him along, anyway, for packing a gun.
Don't be a sap.
That gun was a plant.
It was one of mine.
It's too bad it was only a .25, or maybe you could prove that was the gun that Miles and Thursby were shot with.
No, Sam!
No!
Well, then get him out of here.
Get their names and addresses.
My name is Joel Cairo, Hotel Belvedere.
Miss O'Shaughnessy's address is my office.
Where do you live?
Get him out of here!
I've had enough...
Now, now. Take it easy, will you, Sam?
Is that all you want, Lieutenant?
Yeah. I think I'll be going now.
What's the hurry, Cairo?
There is no hurry.
It's getting quite late, and...
Tell him to leave the gun.
I hope you know what you're doing, Sam.
You're absolutely the wildest, most unpredictable person I've ever known.
Do you always carry on so highhanded?
Well, you've had your talk with Cairo.
Now you can talk to me.
Yes, of course.
I'm listening.
I'm still listening.
Look at the time.
I must be going.
No. Not till you've told me all about it.
Am I a prisoner?
Maybe the boy outside hasn't gone home yet.
Do you suppose he's still there?
Likely.
You can start now.
You are the most insistent person.
And wild and unpredictable, huh?
Say, what's this bird, this Falcon that everybody's all steamed up about?
Supposing I wouldn't tell you anything about it at all?
What would you do?
Something wild and unpredictable?
I might.
It's a black figure, as you know, smooth and shiny, of a bird, a hawk or falcon, about that high.
Here.
What makes it so important?
I don't know.
They wouldn't tell me.
That was in Istanbul?
Marmara.
Go ahead.
But that's all.
Then we found out that Joel Cairo intended to desert us, taking the Falcon with him and leaving Floyd and me nothing.
So we did exactly that to him.
Then I wasn't any better off than I was before, because Floyd hadn't any intention of keeping his promise to me about sharing equally.
I'd learned that by the time we got here.
What's the bird made of?
Porcelain or black stone.
I don't know. I only saw it once for a few minutes.
Floyd showed it to me when we first got hold of it.
You are a liar.
I am.
I've always been a liar.
Don't brag about it.
Was there any truth at all in that yarn?
Some.
Not very much.
Well, we got all night.
Coffee'll be ready soon.
We'll have a cup and try again.
I'm so tired.
So tired of lying and making up lies.
Not knowing what is a lie and what's the truth.
I wish...
I want to talk to Mr. Cairo, Joel Cairo.
Thanks.
Where is he?
What?
Where is he?
Who?
Cairo.
What do you think you're doing, Jack, kidding me?
I'll tell you when I am.
New York, aren't you?
Shove off.
You're gonna have to talk to me before you're through, sonny.
Some of you will, and you can tell the fat man I said so.
Keep asking for it and you're gonna get it, plenty.
I told you to shove off.
Shove off.
People lose teeth talking like that.
You want to hang around, you'll be polite.
Luke.
Hello, Sam.
Hello, Luke.
Say, that was too bad about Miles.
Yeah. It was a tough break.
I want to show you something.
What do you let these cheap gunmen hang around the lobby for, with their heaters bulging in their clothes?
What do you want here?
Well, if you don't want anything, beat it and don't come back.
I won't forget you guys.
What is it?
I don't know.
Say, what about Miles?
I'll see you, Luke.
603.
Good morning.
Good morning.
There you are, sir. Let's go someplace where we can talk.
No.
Our private conversations have not been such that I'm anxious to continue them.
Forgive my speaking so bluntly, but it is the truth.
You mean last night?
What else could I do?
I had to throw in with her.
I don't know where the bird is, and neither do you.
She does.
How're we gonna get it if I don't play along with her?
You always have a very smooth explanation ready, huh?
What do you want me to do?
Learn to stutter? Dundy take you down to the station?
How long did they work on you?
Till a little while ago.
What'd they shake out of you?
Shake out?
Not one thing.
I adhered to the course you indicated earlier in your rooms, but I certainly wish you would have invented a more reasonable story.
I felt distinctly like an idiot repeating it.
Don't worry about the story's goofiness.
A sensible one would have had us all in the cooler.
You sure you didn't tell them anything?
I did not.
Now, you'll want sleep if you've been standing up under a police grilling all night.
See you later.
Yes, I'll have him call you the minute he comes in.
That's the third time she's called this morning.
Miss O'Shaughnessy's in there.
Anything else? The district attorney's office called.
Bryan would like to see you.
And a Mr. Gutman called.
And when I told him you weren't in, he said, "Would you please tell him that
"the young man gave me his message, and that I phoned and will phone again?"
Gutman, huh?
Thanks, darling.
Darling. Somebody's been in my apartment.
It's all upside down, every which way.
I changed as fast as I could and came right over here.
You must have let that boy follow you there.
No, angel.
I shook him off long before I ever went to your place.
It might have been Cairo.
He wasn't at the hotel last night.
He told me he'd been standing up under a police grilling.
I wonder. You saw Joel this morning?
Yeah.
Why?
Because, my own true love, I've got to keep in some sort of touch with all the loose ends of this dizzy affair if I'm ever gonna make heads or tails of it.
Now we've got to find a new home for you.
I won't go back there.
I got an idea.
Wait a minute.
What does your woman's intuition tell you about her?
She's all right.
Maybe it's her own fault for being in whatever the trouble is, but she's all right, if that's what you mean.
That's what I mean.
Are you strong enough for her to put her up for a few days?
You mean at home?
Yeah.
Is she in any danger, Sam?
I think she is.
Gee, that'd scare Mom into a green hemorrhage.
I'd have to say she's a surprise witness or something you're keeping undercover until the last minute.
You're a darling.
Brigid.
Effie here has offered to put you up for a few days.
That's very kind of you.
You'd better start now.
Go out the back entrance.
There's usually a cab parked there by the alleyway.
You ride partway with her over the bridge and make sure you're not followed.
You better change cabs a couple of times, just to be on the safe side.
I'll give Mom a ring.
There's time enough for that when you get back.
I'll call you later.
Hello?
This is Samuel Spade.
Say, my secretary tells me Mr. Bryan wants to see me.
Yeah.
Ask him what time's most convenient for him.
Spade. S P A D E.
Hello, honey.
Yeah.
2:30. All right.
Sam, forgive me. Please forgive me.
I sent those policemen to your place last night.
I was mad, crazy with jealousy.
I phoned that if they went there, they'd learn something about Miles' murder.
What made you think of that?
I was mad, Sam.
I wanted to hurt you.
Did you tell them who you were when you phoned?
No. Sam, dearest, I...
Where'd you phone from?
The drugstore across from your place.
You better hurry along home and think of something to tell the police.
You'll be hearing from them, and by the way, where were you the night Miles was murdered?
Home.
I was.
No.
But if that's your story, it's all right with me.
Now you run along.
Hello?
Yeah, this is Spade.
Yes, Mr. Gutman, I got it.
Yeah, I've been waiting to hear from you.
Well, now.
The sooner, the better. Say, 15 minutes?
Right.
12C.
12C to your left, sir.
Mr. Spade.
How do you do, Mr. Gutman?
You begin well, sir.
I distrust a man who says "when."
He's got to be careful not to drink too much, because he's not to be trusted when he does.
Well, sir, here's to plain speaking and clear understanding.
You're a close mouthed man?
No, I like to talk.
Better and better. I distrust a close mouthed man.
He generally picks the wrong time to talk and says the wrong things.
Talking's something you can't do judiciously unless you keep in practice.
Now, sir.
We'll talk, if you like.
I'll tell you right out.
I'm a man who likes talking to a man who likes to talk.
Swell.
Will we talk about the black bird?
You're a man for me, sir.
No beating about the bush.
Right to the point.
Let's talk about the black bird, by all means.
But first, sir, answer me a question.
Are you here as Miss O'Shaughnessy's representative?
Well, there's nothing certain either way.
It depends. It depends on?
Maybe it depends on Joel Cairo.
Maybe.
The question is then which you represent.
It'll be one or the other.
I didn't say so.
Who else is there?
There's me.
That's wonderful, sir, wonderful.
I do like a man who tells you right out he's looking out for himself.
Don't we all?
I don't trust a man who says he's not.
Now, let's talk about the black bird.
Let's.
Mr. Spade, have you any conception of how much money can be got for that black bird?
No.
Well, sir, if I told you, if I told you half, you'd call me a liar.
No, not even if I thought so.
But you tell me what it is, and I'll figure out the profit.
You mean, you don't know what the bird is?
I know what it's supposed to look like, and I know the value in human life you people put on it.
She didn't tell you what it is?
Cairo didn't, either?
He offered me $10,000 for it.
$10,000.
Dollars, mind you, not even pounds.
Do they know what that bird is, sir?
What is your impression?
There's not very much to go by.
Cairo didn't say he did, and he didn't say he didn't.
She said she didn't, but I took it for granted she was lying.
Not an injudicious thing to do.
If they don't know, I'm the only one in the whole wide sweet world who does.
Swell. When you've told me, that'll make two of us.
Mathematically correct, sir, but I don't know for certain that I'm going to tell you.
Don't be foolish.
You know what it is. I know where it is.
That's why I'm here.
Well, sir, where is it?
You see, I must tell you what I know, but you won't tell me what you know.
It's hardly equitable, sir.
No, no.
I don't think we can do business along those lines.
Well, think again, and think fast!
I told that gunsel of yours you'd have to talk to me before you're through!
I'm telling you now, you'll talk to me today, or you are through!
What are you wasting my time for?
I can get along without you!
And another thing, keep that gunsel out of my way while you're making up your mind.
I'll kill him if you don't!
I'll kill him! Well, sir, I must say you have a most violent temper.
Think it over.
You've got till 5:00.
Then you're either in or out, for keeps!
Who killed Thursby?
I don't know.
Perhaps you don't, but you could make an excellent guess.
My guess might be excellent or it might be crummy, but Mrs. Spade didn't raise any children dippy enough to make guesses in front of a district attorney, an assistant district attorney and a stenographer.
Why shouldn't you, if you've nothing to conceal?
Everybody has something to conceal.
I'm a sworn officer of the law, 24 hours a day, and neither formality nor informality justifies you withholding evidence of crime from me except, of course, on constitutional grounds.
Now, both you and the police have as much as accused me of being mixed up in the other night's murders.
Well, I've had trouble with both of you before, and as far as I can see, my best chance of clearing myself of the trouble you're trying to make for me is by bringing in the murderers all tied up.
And the only chance I've got of catching them and tying them up and bringing them in is by staying as far away as possible from you and the police, because you'd only gum up the works.
You getting this all right, son, or am I going too fast for you?
No, sir. I'm getting it all right.
Good work.
Now, if you want to go to the board and tell them I'm obstructing justice and ask them to revoke my license, hop to it.
You tried it before, and it didn't get you anything but a good laugh all around.
Now, look here.
And I don't want any more informal talks.
I've nothing to say to you or the police, and I'm tired of being called things by every crackpot on the city payroll.
So, if you want to see me pinch me or subpoena me or something, and I'll come down with my lawyer.
I'll see you at the inquest, maybe.
Come on. He wants to see you.
I didn't expect you till 5:25.
I hope I haven't kept you waiting.
Keep on riding me, they're gonna be picking iron out of your liver.
The cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter, huh?
Now, let's go.
Come on.
This'll put you in solid with your boss.
Come in, sir.
Thank you for coming.
Come in.
Here. You shouldn't let him go around with these on him.
He might get himself hurt.
Well, well, what's this?
A crippled newsie took them away from him. I made him give them back.
By gad, sir, you're a chap worth knowing.
An amazing character. Give me your hat.
Sit down.
I owe you an apology, sir.
Now, never mind that.
Let's talk about the black bird.
All right, sir, let's.
Let's.
This is going to be the most astounding thing you've ever heard of, sir.
And I say this knowing that a man of your caliber and your profession must have known some astounding things in his time.
What do you know, sir, about the Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, later known as the Knights of Rhodes and other things?
Crusaders or something, weren't they?
Very good. Sit down.
In 1539, these crusading Knights persuaded Emperor Charles V to give them the island of Malta.
He made but one condition, that they pay him each year the tribute of a falcon in acknowledgement that Malta was still under Spain.
Do you follow me?
Have you any conception of the extreme, the immeasurable wealth of the Order of that time?
I imagine they were pretty well fixed.
"Pretty well" is putting it mildly. They were rolling in wealth, sir.
For years they'd taken from the East nobody knows what spoils of gems, precious metals, silks, ivory, sir.
We all know the holy wars to them were largely a matter of loot.
The Knights were profoundly grateful to the Emperor Charles for his generosity toward them.
They hit upon the happy thought of sending him, for his first year's tribute, not an insignificant live bird but a glorious golden falcon crusted from head to foot with the finest jewels in their coffers.
Well, sir, what do you think of that?
These are facts, historical facts, not schoolbook history, not Mr. Wells' history, but history, nevertheless.
They sent this foot high jeweled bird to Charles, who was then in Spain.
They sent it in a galley commanded by a member of the Order.
It never reached Spain.
A famous admiral of buccaneers took the Knights' galley and the bird.
In 1713, it turned up in Sicily.
In 1840, it appeared in Paris.
It had, by that time, acquired a coat of black enamel, so that it looked nothing more than a fairly interesting black statuette.
In that disguise, sir, it was, as you may say, kicked around Paris for over three score years by private owners too stupid to see what it was under the skin.
Then, in 1923, a Greek dealer named Charilaos Konstantinides found it in an obscure shop.
No thickness of enamel could conceal value from his eyes.
You begin to believe me a little?
I haven't said I didn't.
Well, sir, to hold it safe while pursuing his researches into its history,
Charilaos re enameled the bird.
Despite this precaution, however, I got wind of his find.
If I'd only known a few days sooner.
I was in London when I heard.
I packed a bag, got on the boat train immediately.
On the train I opened the paper, The Times, and read that Charilaos's establishment had been burglarized and him murdered.
Sure enough, on arriving there, I discovered the bird was gone.
That was 17 years ago.
Well, sir, it took me 17 years to locate that bird, but I did.
I wanted it.
I'm a man not easily discouraged when I want something.
I traced it to the home of a Russian general, one Kemidov, in an Istanbul suburb.
He didn't know a thing about it.
It was nothing but a black enameled figure to him, but his natural contrariness kept him from selling it to me when I made him an offer.
So I sent him some agents to get it.
Well, sir, they got it and I haven't got it.
But I'm going to get it.
Your glass.
Then the bird doesn't really belong to any of you, but to a General Kemidov?
Well, sir, you might as well say it belonged to the King of Spain.
I don't see how you can honestly grant anyone else a clear title to it except by right of possession.
And now, sir, before we start to talk prices, how soon can you or how soon are you willing to produce the Falcon?
A couple of days.
That is satisfactory.
Well, sir, here's to a fair bargain. Profits large enough for both of us.
What's your idea of a fair bargain?
I will give you $25,000 when you deliver the Falcon to me and another $25,000 later on.
Or I will give you one quarter of what I realize on the Falcon.
That would amount to a vastly greater sum.
How much greater?
Who knows?
Shall we say $100,000?
Would you believe me if I name a sum that seems the probable minimum?
Why not?
What would you say to a quarter of a million?
Then you think the dingus is worth a million, huh?
In your own words, why not?
That's a lot of dough.
A lot of dough.
Minimum, huh?
What's the maximum?
The maximum, I refuse to guess.
You'd think me crazy.
I don't know.
There's no telling how high it could go, sir.
That is the one and only truth about it.
Wilmer!
Hello, Effie.
Let me talk to Miss O'Shaughnessy.
Isn't there?
What?
She didn't show up?
Listen, you get on back to the office and wait there till I come or you hear from me.
Yeah, let's do something right for a change.
It started in the hold aft, in the rear basement.
What insurance was she carrying?
Anybody burnt?
No. Only the harbor watch was aboard!
Someone I know came...
Huh?
Someone I know came aboard this afternoon, and I haven't seen her since.
I'm worried. No reason to be, mister.
Everybody got off all right.
I wonder if you saw her. She's kind of small, about 5 foot...
I couldn't tell you, mister.
But if she come aboard, she got off all right.
Only the harbor watch was aboard when the fire started.
Now you know as much about it as I do, precious.
Maybe they went down to the ship.
Maybe they didn't. The part about the bird is thrilling.
Or ridiculous.
You know.
Falcon.
Lock that door.
Is...
Is he...
Yeah.
He couldn't have come far with those holes in him.
Why couldn't he have stayed alive long enough to tell us something?
Here, here, here, none of that now.
You can't pass out on me now.
All right, Sam.
Do you really think it's...
We've got it, angel, we've got it!
Answer the phone.
Hello.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Where?
Hello?
Hello!
Hello! That was Miss O'Shaughnessy.
She wants you.
She's in danger.
Where is she?
Burlingame, 26 Ancho.
Sam, her voice, it was awful. And something happened to her before she could finish.
Go help her, Sam!
You've got to go to her, don't you see?
He was helping her, and they killed him...
You've got to go, Sam!
All right, I'll go. Now, after I've gone, you phone the police.
Tell them how it happened, but don't drag any names in.
You don't know. I got the phone call and told you I had to go, but I didn't say where.
Now forget about this thing. Tell them how it happened, but without the bundle.
Now get that straight.
Everything happened exactly as it did happen, but without the bundle, and I got the phone call, not you.
Yes, Sam.
Shut this door and lock it behind me and don't open it till the police come.
Do you know who he is? Yeah, it's Captain Jacoby, master of the La Paloma.
You're a good man, sister.
Can I borrow your pencil?
Say, Frank?
Hello, Mr. Spade.
You got plenty of gas?
Sure thing.
Do you know where Ancho Street or Avenue is in Burlingame?
Nope, but if she's there, we can find her.
Well, 26 is the number and the sooner the better.
All right.
Keep your motor running.
Bum steer, Mr. Spade?
Let's get to a phone booth.
Hello, Mrs. Perine?
Is Effie there?
Yes, please.
Hello, precious. What's the good news?
No, no. It was a bum steer.
Are you sure that was her voice?
Well, it was hooey.
Everything go all right?
Nothing said about the bundle, huh?
That's swell.
They take you down to the hall?
All right, precious.
You better hit the hay and get a good night's rest.
No, no.
Save it till tomorrow.
I'm going on home.
Thanks. Good night, Frank.
Good night, Mr. Spade.
I've been hiding in a doorway up the street.
I thought you'd never come.
Can you make it all right, or shall I carry you?
I'll be all right as soon as I can get some place where I can lie down.
Well, sir, we're all here.
Now, let's come in and sit down and be comfortable and talk.
Sure.
Get away.
You're not gonna frisk me.
Stand still. Shut up.
Take your paws off me, or I'll make you use that gun.
Ask your boss if he wants me shot up before we talk.
Never mind, Wilmer.
You certainly are a most headstrong individual.
Well, let's be seated.
Are you ready to make the first payment and take the Falcon off my hands?
Well, sir, as to that...
As to that...
$10,000?
We were talking about a lot more money than this.
Yes, sir, we were.
But this is genuine coin of the realm.
With a dollar of this, you can buy $10 of talk.
And there are more of us to be taken care of now.
That may be, but I've got the Falcon.
I shouldn't think it would be necessary to remind you, Mr. Spade, that you may have the Falcon, but we certainly have you.
Yeah, I'm trying not to let that worry me. We'll get back to the money later on.
There's something else to be discussed first.
We've got to have a fall guy.
The police have got to have a victim, somebody they can pin those three murders on.
Three? But there's only two, because Thursby certainly killed your partner.
All right.
Only two then. What difference does it make?
The point is, we've got to give the police...
Come, come, Mr. Spade, you can't expect us to believe at this late date that you're the least bit afraid of the police, or that you're not quite able to handle...
I'm in this up to my neck, Gutman.
I've got to find somebody, a victim, when the time comes. If I don't, I'll be it.
Let's give them the gunsel.
He actually did shoot Thursby and Jacoby, didn't he?
Anyway, he's made to order for the part. Look at him.
Let's give him to them.
By gad, sir, you are a character. That you are.
There's never any telling what you'll say or do next, except that it's bound to be something astonishing.
Why, it's our best bet.
With him in their hands...
But, my dear man, can't you see that if I, even for a moment, thought of doing such a thing...
I feel towards Wilmer here just exactly as if he were my own son.
Really, I do.
But if I even for a moment thought of doing what you propose, what in the world would keep Wilmer from telling the police every last detail about the Falcon and all...
Let him talk his head off.
I'll guarantee you nobody'll do anything about it.
Well, what do you think of this, Wilmer?
Mighty funny.
Mighty funny.
How do you feel now? Any better, precious?
Much better.
But I'm frightened.
Well, don't be.
Nothing very bad's going to happen here.
You want a drink, angel?
Be careful, Sam.
Well?
If you're really serious about this, the least we can do in common politeness is to hear you out.
Now, how would you be able to fix it so that Wilmer couldn't do us any harm?
I can show Bryan, our district attorney, that if he goes around trying to collect everybody, he's gonna have a tangled case, but if he sticks to Wilmer here, he can get a conviction standing on his head.
Get up on your feet.
I've taken all the riding from you I'm gonna take.
Get up and shoot it out!
Young Wild West.
Maybe you'd better tell him that shooting me before you get your hands on the Falcon is gonna be bad for business.
Now, now, Wilmer. We can't have any of that.
You shouldn't let yourself attach so much importance to these things.
Then tell him to lay off me then.
Now, Wilmer...
Your plan is not at all satisfactory, sir.
Let's not say anything more about it.
All right. I've got another suggestion.
It may not be as good as the first one, but it's better than nothing.
You want to hear it?
Most assuredly.
Give them Cairo.
Well, by gad, sir...
And suppose we give them you or Miss O'Shaughnessy? How about that?
You want the Falcon. I've got it.
The fall guy's part of the price I'm asking.
As for Miss O'Shaughnessy, if you think she can be rigged for the part, I'm perfectly willing to discuss it with you.
You seem to forget that you are not in a position at all to insist upon anything.
Now, come, gentlemen.
Let's keep our discussion on a friendly basis.
There certainly is something in what Mr. Cairo said.
If you kill me, how are you gonna get the bird?
And if I know you can't afford to kill me, how are you going to scare me into giving it to you?
Sir, there are other means of persuasion besides killing and threatening to kill. Yes, that's...
That's true.
But they're none of them any good unless the threat of death is behind them.
You see what I mean?
If you start something, I'll make it a matter of your having to kill me or call it off.
That's an attitude, sir, that calls for the most delicate judgment on both sides.
Because, as you know, sir, in the heat of action, men are likely to forget where their best interests lie and let their emotions carry them away.
Then the trick from my angle is to make my play strong enough to tie you up, but not make you mad enough to bump me off against your better judgment.
By gad, sir, you are a character.
Six two uneven.
They're selling you out, sonny.
I hope you're not letting yourself be influenced by the guns these pocket edition desperadoes are waving around.
Because I've practiced taking guns away from these boys before, so we'll have no trouble there.
Wilmer, here is...
All right. Wilmer.
Wilmer!
Wilmer!
There's our fall guy.
Either you'll say yes right now, or I'll turn the Falcon and the whole lot of you in.
Don't like that, sir.
You won't like it.
You can have him.
I won't be able to get the Falcon till daylight, or maybe later.
It strikes me it'd be best for all concerned if we did not get out of each other's sight until our business has been transacted.
You have the envelope?
Miss O'Shaughnessy has it.
That's all right.
Hang on to it. We don't have to lose sight of each other. The dingus'll be brought to us here.
Excellent, sir, excellent.
And in exchange for the $10,000 and Wilmer, you'll give us the Falcon and an hour or two of grace.
Now, let's get the details fixed, first.
Why did he shoot Thursby and why, where and how did he shoot Captain Jacoby?
You see, I've got to know all that happened, so I can be sure the parts that don't fit are covered up.
I shall be candid with you, sir.
Thursby was Miss O'Shaughnessy's ally.
We believed that disposing of him in the manner we did would cause Miss O'Shaughnessy to stop and think that, perhaps, it would be best to patch up her differences with us regarding the Falcon.
Then you didn't try to make a deal with him before giving him the works?
We did. Yes, sir. We most certainly did.
I talked to him myself that very night, but I could do nothing with him.
He was quite determinedly loyal to Miss O'Shaughnessy.
So Wilmer followed him back to the hotel and did what he did.
That sounds all right.
Now, Jacoby.
Captain Jacoby's death was entirely Miss O'Shaughnessy's fault.
Tell me what happened.
Well, Cairo, as you must have surmised, got in touch with me after he left police headquarters yesterday night or morning.
He recognized the mutual advantage of pooling forces.
Mr. Cairo is a man of nice judgment.
The Paloma was his thought.
He saw the notice of its arrival in the papers and remembered he had heard in Hong Kong that Jacoby and Miss O'Shaughnessy were seen together.
Well, sir, he saw that notice and, putting two and two together, guessed the truth.
She had given the bird to Jacoby to bring here for her.
And at that juncture, you decided to slip me a Mickey, huh?
There was no place for you in our plan, sir.
So we decided to spare ourselves any possible embarrassment.
Mr. Cairo and Wilmer and I went to call on Captain Jacoby.
We were lucky enough to arrive while Miss O'Shaughnessy was there.
In many ways, the conference was difficult, but we finally persuaded
Miss O'Shaughnessy to come to terms, or so we thought.
We then left the boat and set out for my hotel, where I was to pay Miss O'Shaughnessy and receive the bird.
Well, sir, we mere men should have known better.
En route, she, Captain Jacoby and the Falcon slipped completely through our fingers.
It was neatly done, sir.
Indeed, it was.
You touched off the boat before you left?
No, not intentionally.
Though, I daresay, we, or Wilmer at least, were responsible for the fire.
While the rest of us were talking in the cabin, Wilmer went about the boat, trying to find the Falcon.
No doubt, he was careless with matches.
How about the shooting?
We caught up with Miss O'Shaughnessy and Jacoby at her apartment.
I sent Wilmer downstairs to cover the fire escape before ringing the bell.
And, sure enough, while she was asking us who we were through the door, and we were telling her, we heard a window go up.
Wilmer shot Jacoby as he was coming down the fire escape, shot him more than once, but Jacoby was too tough to fall or drop the Falcon.
He climbed down the rest of the way, knocked Wilmer over and ran off.
We persuaded, that is the word, sir, we persuaded Miss O'Shaughnessy to tell us where she had told Captain Jacoby to take the Falcon.
And we further persuaded her to phone your office in an attempt to draw you away before Jacoby got there, but, unfortunately for us, it had taken us too long to persuade Miss O'Shaughnessy.
And you had the Falcon before we could reach you.
Well, Wilmer, I'm sorry indeed to lose you, but I want you to know
I couldn't be fonder of you if you were my own son.
But, well, if you lose a son, it's possible to get another.
There's only one Maltese Falcon.
When you're young, you simply don't understand these things.
How about some coffee?
Put the pot on, will you, angel?
I don't like to leave our guests.
Surely.
Just a moment, my dear.
Hadn't you better leave the envelope in here?
Sit on it, if you're afraid of losing it.
You misunderstand me.
It's not that at all.
But business should be transacted in a businesslike manner.
For instance, there are only nine bills here now.
There were 10 when I handed them to you, as you very well know.
Well?
I want to know about this.
You palmed it.
I palmed it?
Yes. Do you want to say so, or do you want to stand for a frisk?
You're going to admit it, or I'm gonna search you. There's no third way.
By gad, I believe you would.
I really do. You are a character, if you don't mind my saying so.
You palmed it.
Yes, sir, that I did.
I must have my little joke now and then.
And I was curious to know what you would do in a situation of this sort.
I must say you passed the test with flying colors.
It's the sort of a thing I'd expect from somebody Wilmer's age.
This will soon be yours.
You might as well take it.
I ought to have more than $10,000.
Of course, sir.
You understand this is the first payment.
Later. Oh, yes.
Later you'll give me millions, but how's about $15,000 now?
Frankly and candidly, upon my word of honor as a gentleman,
$10,000 is all the money I can raise.
But you didn't say positively.
Positively.
I'd like to give you a word of advice.
Go ahead.
I daresay you're going to give her some money, but if you don't give her as much as she thinks she ought to have, my word of advice is be careful.
Dangerous?
Very.
How's the coffee coming, angel?
In a few minutes.
It's almost daylight, Mr. Spade.
Can you start getting it now?
I guess so.
Hello?
Hello, precious.
I'm sorry to get you up so early.
Now, listen carefully.
Here's the plot.
In the holland box at the post office there's an envelope with my scrawl.
In that envelope, there's a parcel room check for the bundle we got yesterday.
Now, get that bundle and bring it here, PDQ.
That's a good girl. Now hustle. Goodbye.
Thanks, lady.
Sorry to spoil your day of rest.
Not the first one you've spoiled. Anything else?
No. No, thanks.
Bye bye, then.
There you are.
Now, after 17 years...
It is it.
But we'll make sure.
Fake.
It's a phony!
It's lead!
It's lead!
It's a fake!
All right, you've had your little joke.
Now, tell us about it.
No, Sam! No!
That's the one I got from Kemidov. I swear it!
You.
It's you who bungled it.
You and your stupid attempt to buy it!
Kemidov found out how valuable it was!
No wonder we had such an easy time stealing it!
You imbecile!
You bloated idiot!
You stupid fathead, you!
Yes, it's the Russian's hand.
There's no doubt about it.
Well, sir, what do you suggest?
We stand here and shed tears and call each other names, or shall we go to Istanbul?
Are you going?
Seventeen years I've wanted that little item and have been trying to get it.
If we must spend another year on the quest, well, sir, it will be an additional expenditure in time of only five and fifteen seventeenths percent.
I'm going with you.
Wilmer.
A swell lot of thieves.
We've little enough to boast about, sir, but the world hasn't come to an end just because we've run into a little setback.
I must ask you for that envelope.
I held up my end.
You got your dingus.
It's your hard luck, not mine, it wasn't what you wanted.
Now, come, sir, we've all failed, and there's no reason for expecting any of us to bear the whole brunt.
In short, sir, I must ask you for my $10,000.
This'll take care of my time and expenses.
Now, sir, we'll say goodbye to you, unless you care to undertake the Istanbul expedition with us.
You don't?
Well, frankly, sir, I'd like to have you along.
You're a man of nice judgment and many resources.
Now that there's no alternative,
I daresay you'll manage the police without a fall guy.
I'll make out all right.
Well, sir, the shortest farewells are best.
Adieu.
And to you, Miss O'Shaughnessy, I leave the rara avis on the table there as a little memento.
Hello. Is Sergeant Polhaus there?
Yeah. Put him on.
Hello. Tom? Now, listen.
I've got something for you. Here it is. Jacoby and Thursby were killed by a kid named Wilmer Cook.
Yeah. He's about 20 years old, 5'6", wearing a gray overcoat.
He's working for a man named Kasper Gutman.
Now, you can't miss Gutman. He must weigh 300 pounds.
That fellow Cairo's in with him, too.
They just left here for the Alexandria Hotel.
But you'll have to move fast.
They're blowing town. Now, watch yourself when you go up against the kid.
Yes, that's right.
Very. Now, good luck, Tom.
They'll talk, when they're nailed, about us.
We're sitting on dynamite. We've only got minutes to get set for the police. Now, give me all of it, fast.
When you first came to my office, why did you want Thursby shadowed?
I told you, Sam. I thought he was betraying me, and I wanted to find out.
That's a lie!
You had Thursby hooked, and you knew it, and you wanted to get rid of him before Jacoby came with the loot, so you wouldn't have to split it with him.
Isn't that so? What was your scheme?
I thought if he knew someone was following him, he'd be frightened into going away.
Miles wasn't clumsy enough to be spotted the first night.
You told Thursby he was being followed.
I told him.
I told him.
Yes, but please believe me, Sam.
I wouldn't have told him if I thought Floyd would kill him.
If you thought he wouldn't kill Miles, you were right, angel.
Miles hadn't many brains, but he'd had too many years experience as a detective to be caught like that by a man he was shadowing up a blind alley with his gun on his hip and his overcoat buttoned.
But he'd have gone up there with you, angel.
He was just dumb enough for that.
He'd have looked you up and down, and licked his lips and gone, grinning from ear to ear.
And you could have stood as close to him as you liked in the dark and put a hole through him with a gun you got from Thursby that evening.
Don't, Sam.
Don't say that!
Stop it! The police'll be here any minute!
Now talk! Why do you accuse me...
This isn't the time for that schoolgirl act!
We're both of us sitting under the gallows!
Now, why did you shoot Miles?
I didn't mean to at first, really, I didn't.
But when I found out that Floyd couldn't be frightened...
I can't look at you and tell you this, Sam!
You thought Thursby would tackle Miles and one or the other would go down.
If Thursby was killed, you were rid of him.
If it was Miles, you'd see that Thursby was caught and set up for it.
Isn't that right?
Something like that.
When you found that Thursby wasn't going to tackle him, you borrowed his gun and did it yourself, right?
And when you heard Thursby was shot, you knew Gutman was in town.
And you knew you needed another protector, somebody to fill Thursby's boots, so you came back to me.
Yes!
Sweetheart, it wasn't only that.
I'd have come back to you, sooner or later.
From the very first instant I saw you, I knew.
Well, if you get a good break, you'll be out of Tehachapi in 20 years, and you can come back to me then.
I hope they don't hang you, precious, by that sweet neck.
You're not...
Yes, angel, I'm gonna send you over.
The chances are you'll get off with life.
That means, if you're a good girl, you'll be out in 20 years.
I'll be waiting for you.
If they hang you, I'll always remember you.
Don't, Sam.
Don't say that, even in fun.
I was frightened for a minute.
I really thought...
You do such wild and unpredictable things.
Now, don't be silly.
You're taking the fall.
You've been playing with me, just pretending you cared to trap me like this.
You didn't care at all!
You don't love me!
I won't play the sap for you.
You know it's not like that.
You can't say that.
You never played square with me for half an hour at a stretch since I've known you.
You know down deep in your heart that in spite of anything I've done, I love you.
I don't care who loves who!
I won't play the sap for you!
I won't walk in Thursby's and I don't know how many others' footsteps!
You killed Miles, and you're going over for it.
How can you do this to me, Sam?
Surely Mr. Archer wasn't as much to you as...
Listen.
This won't do any good.
You'll never understand me, but I'll try once and then give it up.
When a man's partner is killed, he's supposed to do something about it.
It doesn't make any difference what you thought of him.
He was your partner, and you're supposed to do something about it, and it happens we're in the detective business.
Well, when one of your organization gets killed, it's...
It's bad business to let the killer get away with it, bad all around, bad for every detective everywhere.
You don't expect me to think that these things you're saying are sufficient reason for sending me...
Wait till I'm through.
Then you can talk.
I've no earthly reason to think I can trust you, and if I do this and get away with it, you'll have something on me that you can use whenever you want to.
Since I've got something on you,
I couldn't be sure that you wouldn't put a hole in me someday.
All those are on one side.
Maybe some of them are unimportant.
I won't argue about that.
But look at the number of them.
And what have we got on the other side?
All we've got is that maybe you love me and maybe I love you.
You know whether you love me or not.
Maybe I do.
I'll have some rotten nights after I've sent you over, but that'll pass.
And if all I've said doesn't mean anything to you, then forget it and we'll make it just this,
I won't because all of me wants to regardless of consequences, and because you've counted on that with me the same as you counted on that with all the others.
Would you've done this to me if the Falcon had been real and you'd got your money?
Don't be too sure I'm as crooked as I'm supposed to be.
That sort of reputation might be good business, bringing high priced jobs and making it easier to deal with the enemy, but a lot more money would have been one more item on your side of the scales.
If you'd loved me, you wouldn't have needed any more on that side.
Come in.
Hello, Tom. Got them?
Got them.
Swell. Here's another one for you.
She killed Miles.
And I've got some exhibits, the boys' guns, one of Cairo's, and a $1,000 bill I was supposed to be bribed with, and this black statuette here that all the fuss was about.
What's the matter with your little playmate?
He looks brokenhearted.
And I bet when he heard Gutman's story, he thought he had me.
Cut it out, Sam.
Well, shall we be getting down to the hall?
It's heavy.
What is it?
The stuff that dreams are made of.
You see? You see the symbolism of it?
Capital and Labor destroy each other.
It teaches a moral lesson. It has social significance.
Who wants to see that kind of stuff? It gives me the creeps.
Tell him how long it played in the Music Hall.
It was held over a fifth week.
Who goes to the Music Hall? Communists!
Communists? This picture's an answer to Communists!
It shows we're awake... and not dunking our heads in the sand like a bunch of ostriches!
I want this picture to be a commentary on modern conditions.
Stark realism. The problems that confront the average man.
- But with a little sex. - A little, but I don't want to stress it.
I want this picture to be a document.
I want to hold a mirror up to life.
I want this to be a picture of dignity...
- a true canvas of the suffering of humanity. - But with a little sex.
- With a little sex in it. - How about a nice musical?
How can you talk about musicals at a time like this, with the world committing suicide?
With corpses piling up in the street, with grim death gargling at you from every corner,
- with people slaughtered like sheep! - Maybe they'd like to forget.
Then why did they hold this one over for a fifth week? For the ushers?
- It died in Pittsburgh. - Like a dog.
- What do they know in Pittsburgh? - They know what they like.
If they knew what they liked, they wouldn't live in Pittsburgh.
If you pandered to the public, you'd still be in the horse age.
- You think we're not? Look at Hopalong Cassidy. - You look at him!
We'd still be making Keystone chases, bathing beauties, custard pie...
- And a fortune. - A fortune.
Of course I'm just a minor employee here, Mr. LeBrand...
He's starting that one again.
I wanted to make you something outstanding...
something you could be proud of, something that would realize the potentialities of film... as the sociological and artistic medium that it is.
With a little sex in it. Something like...
- Something like Capra. I know. - What's the matter with Capra?
- Look, you want to make O Brother, Where Art Thou?
- Yes. - Now, wait a minute! - Then go ahead and make it!
For what you're getting, I can't afford to argue with you.
That's a fine way to start a man out on a million-dollar production.
You want it, you've got it!
I can take it on the chin. I've taken it before.
- Not from me you haven't. - Not from you, Sully, that's true.
Not with pictures like So Long Sarong,
Hey, Hey, In the Hayloft, Ants in Your Plants of 1939...
But they weren't about tramps, lockouts, sweatshops, people eating garbage in alleys and living in piano boxes and ash cans.
- And phooey! - They're about nice, clean young people... who fell in love...
with laughter and music and legs.
Now take that scene in Hey, Hey, In the Hayloft...
But you don't realize conditions have changed.
There isn't any work. There isn't any food.
- These are troublous times. - What do you know about trouble?
- What do I know about trouble? - Yes, what do you know about trouble?
- What do you mean, what do I know about trouble? - Just what I'm saying.
You want to make a picture about garbage cans...
When did you eat your last meal out of one?
- What's that got to do with it? - He's asking you.
You want an epic about misery... you want to show hungry people sleeping in doorways.
With newspapers around them.
You want to grind 10,000 feet of hard luck,
- and all I'm asking you is, what do you know about hard luck?
- Yes! - What do you mean? Don't you think I've...
- No.
- What? - You have not.
I sold newspapers till I was 20, then I worked in a shoe store and put myself through law school at night.
- Where were you at 20? - I was in college.
When I was 13 I supported three sisters, two brothers and a widowed mother.
- Where were you at 13? - I was in boarding school.
- I'm sorry. - You don't have to be ashamed of it, Sully.
That's the reason your pictures have been so light, so cheerful, so inspiring.
They don't stink with messages.
That's why I paid you 500 a week when you were 24.
- 750 at 25. - 1,000 when you were 26.
- When I was 26, I was getting 18. - 2,000 at 27.
- I was getting 25 then. - 3,000 after Thanks for Yesterday.
4,000 after Ants in Your Plants.
I suppose you're trying to tell me I don't know what trouble is.
- Yes! - In a nice way, Sully.
You're absolutely right. I haven't any idea what it is.
People always like what they don't know anything about.
I had a lot of nerve wanting to make a picture about human suffering.
You're a gentleman to admit it, Sully, but then, you are anyway.
How about making Ants in Your Plants of 1941?
- You can have Bob Hope, Mary Martin... - Maybe Bing Crosby.
- The Abbott Dancers. - Maybe Jack Benny and Rochester.
- A big-name band. - What?
Oh, no. I want to make O Brother, Where Art Thou?
But I'll tell you what I'm gonna do first.
I'm going down to wardrobe to get some old clothes,
- some old shoes, - Huh?
- and I'm gonna start out with ten cents in my pocket.
- What? I don't know where I'm going, but I'm not coming back...
- till I know what trouble is. - What?
Don't worry, you can take me off salary.
Who's talking about taking you off salary?
- So long. Thanks for the idea. - Wait!
Don't be so impulsive. - How soon will you be back? - I don't know.
Maybe a week, maybe a month, maybe a year.
Don't worry about me. And thanks, Dracula. You gave me a great idea.
I gave you...
- Now look what you've done. - Yeah... What I've done?
With your lies about selling newspapers!
I sold as many newspapers as you supported a family at 13.
- I opened a shooting gallery. - With money you borrowed from your uncle.
- We better insure him for a million. - He's worth more.
- The bonehead. - Yes, but what a genius.
Get me a copy of that O Brother, Where Art Thou?
I guess I'll have to read it now.
Make that two copies. Why should I suffer alone?
- How's this? - Isn't that overdoing it, a bit sir?
Why break their hearts?
All right. Let's try that one again.
I think this one's sufficiently seedy, sir.
There's no use overplaying it, is there, sir?
Yes?
- Your wife is on one, sir. - What does she want?
I suspect it has something to do with today's being the 15th.
Payday. All right, put her on.
You may connect Mrs. Sullivan.
Yes?
You don't happen to remember what day this is, do you, dear?
Yes, I happen to remember what day it is.
No, I haven't forgotten anything. Have you?
Perhaps I could be a little more polite, Mrs. Sullivan, but somehow, when I talk to you I don't feel polite.
I regret it, but that's the way it is.
I don't know whether I signed it or not.
I always close my eyes when I sign your check.
Maybe I signed the blotter.
Have you made out the Panther Woman's check yet?
You better get it down to her before she comes up here with the sheriff.
She has a very peculiar sense of humor.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, Burrows. How do you like it?
I don't like it at all, sir. Fancy dress, I take it?
- What's the matter with it? - I have never been sympathetic...
- to the caricaturing of the poor and needy, sir. - Who's caricaturing?
Burrows doesn't know about the expedition, sir.
I'm going out on the road to find out what it's like to be poor and needy, and then I'm going to make a picture about it.
If you'll permit me to say so, sir, the subject is not an interesting one.
The poor know all about poverty... and only the morbid rich would find the topic glamorous.
But I'm doing it for the poor. Don't you understand?
I doubt if they would appreciate it, sir.
They rather resent the invasion of their privacy, I believe quite properly, sir.
Also, such excursions can be extremely dangerous, sir.
I worked for a gentleman once who likewise, with two friends, accoutered themselves as you have, sir, and then went out for a lark.
They have not been heard from since.
- That was some time ago? - 1912, sir.
- Huh. - You see, sir, rich people... and theorists...
who are usually rich people... think of poverty in the negative, as the lack of riches... as disease might be called the lack of health.
But it isn't, sir.
Poverty is not the lack of anything, but a positive plague, virulent in itself, contagious as cholera, with filth, criminality, vice and despair as only a few of its symptoms.
It is to be stayed away from, even for purposes of study.
It is to be shunned.
You seem to have made quite a study of it.
Quite unwillingly, sir. Will that be all, sir?
- Thanks. - Very good, sir.
He gets a little bit gruesome every once in a while.
Yeah. Always reading books, sir.
- Oh. - As a matter of fact, sir,
I don't like the idea of a gentleman of your inexperience... leaving with only ten cents in his pockets, so I took the extreme liberty, sir, of having a studio identification card... sewed into the sole of each of your boots.
You'd think I was a child. The whole purpose of this expedition...
All right, all right, all right.
Before you all get started, I just want to tell you one thing...
- My mind is made up. - Nobody's here to argue, Sully.
- I know. - You know that your slightest wish...
We talked it all over, and there's something to the idea.
- There's a great deal to it. - Stupendous.
Cassy has it all worked out. It's safe as a church, big as a cathedral.
Bigger! It's the story of the year.
It'll make the front page of every newspaper in the country.
- I'm sending five of my boys...
- With me in charge.
An advance agent in front and a follow-up behind.
- A cook and a still man. - I want lots of 8x10's.
- Now, listen...
- I'm revamping that lovely land yacht... that Demille used in Northwest Mounted.
- It follows at a discreet dis...
- Hot coffee, sandwiches, and a bar in back.
It's connected to the studio by shortwave, and it also carries...
- A hot shower and a secretary. - And a physician.
Look, I'm trying to find trouble, but I won't find it with six acts of vaudeville on my tail... at least, not the kind I'm looking for.
- Be reasonable, Sully. - I'm reupholstering it from stem to stern.
- Wait till you see. - I tell you, I've made up my mind.
- Definitely? - Definitely.
- In that case, there's nothing else to do... - You said it.
but to serve you with this summons to appear and show cause... why you should not be restrained from jeopardizing your unique and extraordinary services...
- by willfully, recklessly and unnecessarily... - Will you please wait a minute!
We have all day, Sully, but you must realize... we also have minds, also made up.
Thus begins this remarkable expedition...
- into the valley of the shadow of adversity. - The shadow of the what?
The valley of the shadow of adversity.
- It's what you call a paraphrase. - Alone and unattended...
- With eight stooges. - I'll write the story, if it's just the same to you.
Prey to passing prowlers, poverty and policemen,
- How poetic. - with only ten cents in his pocket,
- I wish I had what he's got in the bank.
- John Lloyd Sullivan, the Caliph of Comedy...
- Departed Hollywood at 4:00 this morning. - You said it.
- Can I sell you another stack, Doctor?
- Get me some bicarbonate of soda, and don't call me "Doctor. "
He was talking to me, I think. No, thank you.
- You say don't want some bicarbonate of soda, Doctor? - Don't call me "Doctor"!
- No, I don't want any bicarbonate of soda. - I thought you said you did.
Well, he don't!
- This place is very depressing. - So was the breakfast.
Why doesn't he read a book if he wants to learn something?
- Who, the cook? He could learn plenty. - No, Sullivan.
- Maybe he don't know how to read. - The cook?
No, the...
- This is gonna be a great trip. - Sorry. I must have the wrong number.
That was the lighthouse keeper on San Clemente Island.
Ask him what his daughter's doing.
I said the lighthouse keeper on San Clemente Island.
- How about a little gin rummy? - I don't drink, thank you. Never touch it.
- How about a lift, Bud? - If you don't mind going fast.
I'm studying to be a whippet tanker.
- Go to it, Lieutenant! - You're there, General.
- Can a whippet tank make a sharp turn? - What?
Can a whippet tank go up a side road?
A whippet tank can go anywhere. Hang on!
Thank you, Major.
- This is where I get out. - She's some tank, ain't she?
In a class by herself. I never felt anything like it.
Well, I guess I better be getting to school now, anyway.
Yeah, I guess you better had. Drive carefully.
- You know me. - By the way, how old are you?
- Thirteen. So long. - So long.
What a future.
What were you chasing, a jackrabbit?
- Felt more like a kangaroo. - There he is!
- Well, how'd you like it? - That was a dirty trick, boss.
Look, that was just a rough idea, unless you play ball with me.
You know I can't do what I started out to do with you guys chasing me around, so I'll make you a fair proposition.
You can go on wherever you like and take it easy for a couple of weeks, and I'll join you then or sooner.
If the boss wants to talk to me, I'm just up ahead, mooching a lunch from a farmer's wife.
Now, is that a square proposition or isn't it?
- Well, I always wanted to go to Boulder Dam. - You're there.
Yeah, well, if you think I'm going to look at Boulder Dam...
How about National Yellow Park?
That goes double for National Yellow Park.
- If you'd said Las Vegas... - What do they do in Las Vegas?
Everything, Doctor. It's an education.
All right. I'll meet you in Las Vegas, on or about the first.
And thanks, kids. Thanks sincerely.
Yoo-hoo!
- Yes, ma'am? - Don't get too tired.
Yes, ma'am.
First day's work. You don't suppose you're overworking him, do you?
Oh, but I doubt it. He seems very strong. Did you notice his torso?
- I notice that you noticed it. - Don't be vindictive, dear.
Some people are just naturally more sensitive to some things in life than some people.
Some are blind to beauty, while others...
Even as a little girl, you were more of acid type, dear, while I, if you remember...
- I remember better than you do. - Well, forget it.
And furthermore, I have never done anything that I was ashamed of, Ursula.
- Neither have I. - Yes, but nobody ever asked you to.
- Why, Zeffie Kornhauser!
- Now that you've had your attack for the day, let's endeavor to recapture our good humor and remember our breeding.
- Baloney. - Yes. I do hope he likes it here.
It's so hard to keep a man. Do you know what I need?
- Yes! - I need a permanent.
I was thinking of taking in a picture show, which brings up the problem of clothes for the young man.
- It certainly does.
- Do you think... dear Joseph would mind if we gave him... some of the clothes he has so little need for now?
He's never minded before.
- Sleep tight. - Yes, ma'am.
- And don't let the skeeters bite. - Yes, ma'am.
- You're sure you have everything you want? - Yes, ma'am.
- Absolutely sure? - Positive.
- But your bed isn't open. - That's all right. I'll take care of that.
Oh, nonsense. That's woman's work.
? For men must work and women must weep?
Or however it goes. Ahh!
- There. Would you like a hot water bottle? - No, ma'am.
- You haven't any pajamas. - I never use them.
- Joseph wore a nightgown. - Is that a fact?
Oh, yes.
- Well, I guess there's nothing else. - No, I guess not.
I'll let you know as soon as the bathroom is free.
- It's community. - Ah.
Well, uh...
- Good night. - Good night.
- Do you think he'll stay? - I do, do hope so.
Who is it?
Say, could you give me a lift? I'm freezing to death.
- What did you fall into? - Everything there was.
Okay. Hop in the back. Here.
Drape this around you. Thanks a million, buddy. - Okay.
Come on, Buddy, wake up. This is as far as I go.
- Huh? What? Who are you?
- Come on, wake up. I don't want the boss to see you. We ain't supposed to give lifts.
Sure. Thanks a lot.
- Hey, what city is this? - That's Hollywood.
- Hollywood? - You get a chance to see the moving picture stars.
Well, so long.
- Good morning. - Morning.
Give me a cup of coffee and a donut, if that's enough for it.
- You want it plain or with powdered sugar? - With a little cream.
- The sinker? - Any kind, or some rolls. I don't care.
Yes, sir.
Give him some ham and eggs.
Yes, ma'am.
That's very kind of you sister, but I'm not hungry.
A cup of coffee and a sinker will fix me up fine.
Don't be a sucker. Give him some ham and eggs.
The way I'm fixed, 35 cents isn't going to make any difference.
- Here. - Thanks.
Things a little tough, huh?
I wouldn't be sitting in an owl wagon for local color.
They locked me out of my room.
That's too bad. Well, things are tough everywhere.
War in Europe, strikes over here... There's no work.
- There's no food. - Drink your coffee while it's hot.
- What did they lock you out of your room for? - Did I ask you any questions?
- I'm sorry. - It's all right.
- You been in Hollywood long? - Long enough.
- Trying to crash the movies or something? - Something like that.
- I guess that's pretty hard to do, huh? - I guess so.
I never got close enough to find out.
- Oh. Sorry. - Say, who's being sorry for who?
Am I buying you the eggs or are you buying me the eggs?
- I'd just like to repay you. - All right, give me a letter of introduction to Lubitsch.
- I might be able to do that. Who's Lubitsch? - Drink your coffee.
- Can you act? - What did you say?
- I said, can you act? - Sure, I can act.
- Would you like me to give you a recitation?
- Go ahead. Skip it. My next act will be an impersonation... of a young lady going home...
on the thumb.
- In that outfit? - What about your own outfit?
- I mean, haven't you got a car? - No. Have you?
- No, but...
- Then don't get ritzy.
And I'll tell you some other things I haven't got.
I haven't got a yacht, or a pearl necklace, or a fur coat, or a country seat, or even a winter seat.
I could use a new girdle, too.
I wish I could give you some of the things you need.
You wouldn't be trying to lead me astray, would you?
You know, the nice thing about buying food for a man... is that you don't have to laugh at his jokes.
Just think... if you were some big shot, like a casting director,
I'd be staring into your bridgework saying,
"Yes, Mr. Smearkase. No, Mr. Smearkase.
"Not really, Mr. Smearkase.
Oh, Mr. Smearkase, that's my knee. "
Give Mr. Smearkase another cup of coffee. Make it two.
- Want a piece of pie? - No thanks, kid.
Why, Mr. smearkase, aren't you getting a little familiar?
Look...
Thanks.
Look, if you wanted to stay in Hollywood a little longer...
I don't want to stay in Hollywood a little longer.
I've used up all my money, all my going-home money.
I was just gonna say, I have a friend that's out of town... and you might be able to stay at his place for a couple of weeks... and maybe by then things will break a little better for you.
- He might even be able to help you a little. - No, thanks.
There's no strings to this, kid.
I know you don't know who I am, but I used to know a few people around here.
And this guy's really out of town.
And you know a way in through the window. No, thanks.
- No. I'm pretty sure that in this case...
- I'm going home, big boy.
I can get a ride out of here in a little while.
I don't like to think of you asking a bunch of thugs for lifts along the highway.
- Then don't think about it. - You mean you'd just get in any car that comes along?
- Anything but a Stanley Steamer. My uncle blew up in one. - That's terrible.
You can't tell what kind of a heel is apt to be behind the wheel.
All heels are pretty much the same.
- Look. - Yes, Mr. Smearkase?
This friend of mine... the guy I was telling you about that's out of town...
I'm sure he wouldn't mind if I borrowed his car.
- What is it, a street car? - It's a car. Just wait here.
You're just going to get yourself in trouble.
I'm not going to get myself in trouble. I'm going to repay you.
That isn't necessary, big boy.
Someday, when your ship comes in, you can buy somebody that's hungry some ham and eggs and be all square.
That's fine. Just wait here and I'll be back before you can say...
- What was that big director's name? - Lubitsch.
Lubitsch.
Say, this is some car.
Yes. Now, where would you like to go?
Could you drop me off at, uh...
Or maybe that'd be too far.
- That depends entirely on where it is. - Would Chicago be too far?
- Chicago? You mean Chicago, Illinois?
- Yes. I wasn't actually thinking of driving as far as Chicago.
That's all right. You can drop me anywhere.
I just happened to think of Chicago because... that's a little better than halfway and I can easily hitch a ride out of there.
- Where do you live, Bermuda? - You don't have to get funny.
I didn't ask you for a ride. You can drop me anywhere.
Wait a minute. How's this?
Suppose you drop me off somewhere and you go leisurely home... and I'll pick up the car later.
That's what you call an idea.
You don't happen to operate out of a booby hatch, do you?
You better drop me at the next corner and take this bus back where you stole it from.
Don't talk nonsense. I left a note saying I was taking the car...
- Or did I? - It would be nice if you could remember.
Would be funny, though, if they arrested me for taking it.
A panic. Who does it belong to?
- Belongs to a picture director... a guy named Sullivan.
- Oh. - You never heard of him?
- No. He's made quite a few pictures.
Ants In Your Plants of 1939.
- Did he do that? - Yeah. Did you see it?
- Yes. - Well? Well, did you like it?
- Not much. - Some people thought it was pretty good.
I don't care for musicals. They hurt my ears.
I see. Well, did you like Hey, Hey, in the Hayloft?
- Oh, I was crazy about that. - I thought that would just about fit.
- You remember the scene where the two are in the hayloft?
- Perfectly. And she made him close his eyes and count three before kissing her.
- Yes, yes. - And then the pig came out and he kissed the pig instead.
It was on a very high plane.
Then he fell through a hole and sneezed at a horse.
And the horse sneezed back at him.
Oh, that was a wonderful scene.
Of course it was stupid, but it was wonderful. Who directed that picture?
Don't you think with the world in its present condition, with death snarling at you from every street corner, that people are a little allergic to comedies?
- No. - Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.
Say, how come you know a picture director well enough to borrow his car?
As a matter of fact, I used to know most of those boys, but naturally I don't like to mention it in a suit like this.
As a matter of fact, I used to be a picture director.
- Why, you poor kid. - Don't get emotional. I'll be all right.
What kind of pictures did you make?
- More along educational lines. - Oh, no wonder.
There's nothing like a deep-dish movie to drive you out in the open.
What are you talking about?
Film's the greatest educational medium the world has ever known.
- You take a picture like Hold Back Tomorrow. - You hold it.
- Did you ever meet Lubitsch?
- Yes. Gee, I bet he wouldn't even speak to you now.
- He spoke to me day before yesterday. - Isn't that swell.
Funny, isn't it... to meet your first picture director... on the day you're leaving Hollywood, all washed up... even a washed-up director.
Don't get sympathetic. I might make a comeback, you know.
That's what they all say.
Man that had my room ahead of me... he was always going to make a comeback.
He was a picture director too. Then one day he shot himself instead.
They had to re-paper the room.
You wouldn't ever do anything like that would you, big boy?
Not on your wallpaper.
What do you suppose that is?
Whatever it is, there's absolutely nothing they can do.
Remember that.
- What did you say? - I said there's absolutely nothing they can do.
- All right, you. - All right yourself. Don't give it a thought.
Well?
Oh, good morning, sir.
- I'm so sorry. - Good morning, sir.
- Ever seen this man before? - That is Mr. Sullivan, sir,
- the owner of the alleged hot car. - Then what's all the hullabaloo?
That's what I'd like to know.
- You John L. Sullivan? - What about it?
- What's your occupation? - Motion picture director.
- That right? - Yes, sir.
Let me see your driver's license.
- I haven't got it. Did you bring it? - No, sir.
- Driving without a license, huh? - Yes, isn't that terrible?
I suppose that calls for a dollar fine and ten minutes in jail.
- You sure this is Sullivan? - Oh, quite, sir.
- What are you doing in those clothes? - I just paid my income tax.
- All right, but you don't drive that car without a license.
- Okay. Let the girl out too. She's getting bored in there.
How does a girl fit in this picture?
There's always a girl in the picture.
Haven't you ever been to the movies?
Where's he taking us now? Whose car is this?
- The same guy. Sullivan. - Where's he taking us?
Down to the depot to buy you a ticket and send you home. Stop fooling around.
- Who's buying me a ticket? - Sullivan.
- What did I ever do for him? - You bought him some eggs.
Oh. So you're the washed-up director.
I'm afraid I exaggerated that part of it a little bit.
What are you doing in those clothes?
- I just pulled that one down at the police station.
- Huh? I made up a joke. Look, I'm not sore at you.
I'm sore at those cops for dragging me all the way back here.
No matter where I start out for, I always end up right back here in Hollywood.
You're a very nice girl, as a matter of fact, and I'm glad to have met you.
If there's ever anything I can do for you, I'd be delighted. Honestly.
- You mean that? - Sincerely.
Then buy me some ham and eggs before I bite you.
Home.
Where's the swimming pool?
You must have a swimming pool.
Right out here.
Outside dining room,
- barbecue...
Pretty, isn't it?
Yeah.
There's the tennis court up there, grape arbor there, and a grove there.
I guess that's about all.
- What are you looking at me that way for?
- Hey, you big fathead! - What's the big idea?
That's for your swimming pools and your tennis courts... and your limousines and your barbecues.
That's for making fun of a poor girl who only tried to help you,
- you big faker! - Who made fun of you?
You did, with your stories of being a washed-up director, you big clunk.
Oh, I did, did I?
Breakfast is served, sir.
- You might have shaved. - I need these whiskers for my experiment.
- Yes, the noble experiment. - You don't have to make any cracks.
I don't suffer and starve because I like it, you know.
Neither does anybody else.
- I'm sorry. - It's all right.
- I'm sorry I pushed you in the water too. - I probably needed it.
- You certainly did. - Did I?
I didn't mind you. As a matter of fact, I had kind of a yen for you.
- You have? - Not in that thing.
I liked you better as a tramp.
I can't help what kind of people you like.
It's funny.
I suppose I ought to be very happy for you, as if you'd just struck oil or something.
Instead of that, I'm sore.
Don't frown. You're making lines on your face.
You've taken all the joy out of life.
I was all through with this kind of stuff.
I knew I'd never have it, but there was no envy in my heart.
I'd found a friend who swiped a car to take me home.
Now I'm right back where I started... just an extra girl having breakfast with a director, only I didn't used to have breakfast with them.
- Maybe that was my trouble. - Did they ever ask you to?
- No. - Then don't pat yourself on the back.
- Take me with you. - What?
On your experiment. I don't want to be sent home.
Don't be childish. I'll tell you what I'll do.
You can stay here for a couple of weeks like I told you in the owl wagon, and when I get back, I'll see what I can do for you.
I don't want to start all that stuff again.
Take me with you.
When you get as far as you're going, we can say good-bye... and I'll go the rest of the way alone.
It'll make a nice ending, and we'll finish what we started this morning.
It's absolutely out of the question.
Please. You don't know anything about anything.
You don't know how to get a meal, how to keep a secret,
- and you can't even stay out of town. - Thanks.
I know 50 times as much about trouble as you ever will.
Besides, you owe it to me.
You sort of belong to me. When you were a hobo, I found you.
- Piffle. - Please.
- It's absolutely out of the question. - I'll throw you in the water.
You'd take my mind off my work.
The big director that has all the girls panting for him.
- I tell you...
- I'll follow you.
I'll tell everybody who you are, like a kid sister.
You'll follow me?
Yes, I'll follow you, and I'll holler, " This guy's a phony.
"This is Sullivan, the big director from Hollywood... a phonus-balonus, a faker, a heel... "
If I may join in the controversy, sir,
I think the young lady's suggestion an excellent one.
- You may not join in the controversy. - I will, I will, I will!
- I'm going with you! - You'll do nothing of the kind.
Would you get me some tramp clothes, Mr. Burrows?
- Certainly, Miss. Certainly. - Go down to the station and get me a ticket to...
- Where do you live? - I won't tell you. I won't be sent home.
You stop that! Now, stop that! Grab her feet!
Oh! Yes, sir, yes, sir. Certainly, sir.
- Now, miss...
Now, miss...
Stop it, please, miss! - I won't be sent home!
- Let go of me! - Oh, my!
Mr. Burrows... This way, Mr. Burrows.
There we are. Now, one, two, three... Pull hard!
Hello, Information?
Have you any freight trains... going east this afternoon or early this evening?
5:48?
Thank you very much, sir.
Oh, and could you tell me, does that train carry tramps, and if so, where do they get on?
What? It's on page two.
- What did you say? - Tramps.
How would you like to take a flying...
Wise guy. Yes, sir?
What was that again?
I said I wonder if you'd be kind enough to settle a bet for us.
Just a few of us here at the club.
If a tramp were to board your 5:48 this afternoon, from where would he board it?
I see. I see. Yes...
but not within the yard limits.
I think that gives me the complete picture.
Thank you very much for your trouble.
Oh, and by the way, I win.
Good day.
A different approach to the same problem.
I think this is it, sir.
Why don't you go back with the car.
You look about as much like a boy as Mae West.
All right, they'll think I'm your frail.
I believe it's called a "beazel," miss, if memory serves.
- Good-bye, Burrows. See you in a couple of weeks. - Good-bye.
May I close, sir, by warning you against the entire expedition, which I envision with deep apprehension...
- and gloomy foreboding. - Thanks. Same to you.
Come on.
Jump!
Come on. Here.
I'll help you.
- Let me up! - I've got you!
- We made it! - Yeah.
Amateurs.
Phew!
Oh. How do you do?
- Beautiful weather. - If it doesn't rain.
How do you feel about the labor situation?
Where are you going?
I hope we didn't disturb you.
- Very interesting couple. - Yeah.
- Do you smell anything? - I certainly do.
- What does it smell like to you? - Hogs.
- That's what I was afraid of. - I'm getting hungry.
How can you possibly be hungry when you just ate?
I'm not a scientist. All I know is I'm hungry.
You'd better tell the porter to close the window.
I didn't ask you to come along in the first place. Now that you're...
Don't start baking wise cracks.
- Dough, sir. - Blasted draft in here, at that.
- Where is this train going? - I don't know.
- How long does it take to get there? - I didn't ask you to come along.
I think that's a perfectly reasonable question.
Haven't you got enough imagination to pretend we're broke, hungry, homeless, drifting in despair?
Let's just sit here and try to feel like a couple of tramps.
- Cold? - I'll be all right.
- It's the desert. - I'll be all right.
As soon as this blasted thing comes to a town someplace,
I'll send for a car and have you taken home.
This is a lot of "hokey-palokey. "
This is a terrible way to travel, with a girl.
It's better with a girl than without one. You would have frozen to death.
If I go back, will you go back with me?
- Dodsense. - Then I won't go back, either.
- You're so simple, you're apt to get into trouble. - Why do you think I'm here?
Gee, I like that about you.
You're like those knights of old, who used to ride around looking for trouble.
- Who was it who rode on a pure white horse? - Lady Godiva.
She must have been a nut. I bet her husband was sore. Are you jealous?
Why don't you shut up and try to get some sleep.
- Will you go to sleep too? - I'll try.
Why don't you try counting the hogs jumping over a hedge?
Listen, short britches...
- What's that? - Nothing. Just me.
- What? - I sneezed.
- You what? - I...
- I sneezed. - Oh, you poor darling.
- Have you got hay fever? - I think it's hog fever.
Oh, you poor lamb.
It'll be alright as soon as the sun gets a little warmer.
Are you hungry? You got me doing it.
- Have we got any eating money? - Ten cents.
Can we spend it for breakfast, or are you saving it for something?
Look, I've already told you, I'll send for a car for you and...
I can't help it if I'm good-natured.
I like to be with you, and it puts me in a good humor.
You take lots of girls and made them sleep in a hog sty all night, and then didn't tell them where their breakfast was coming from... the next morning, they wouldn't take it lying down.
We'll find some breakfast somewhere.
- In some swill pail, I suppose. - What do the other bubs do?
They steal chickigs... chickens.
and they roast them over campfires... with baked potatoes and green corn on the cob...
- with melted butter...
- Shut up!
- Where do they get the butter? - They steal it.
Well, they don't. It isn't as easy as all that.
There's a lot of suffering in this world...
- that ordinary people don't know anything about.
- Now what's the matter? - I'm hungry.
Well...
Hey, there's a town up ahead.
Let's get off and see what happens.
- What town is it? - I don't know. I suppose it's Hollywood.
Look, there's a lunch stand.
Come on.
Come on. I can't keep running along here all day.
Here I come. Just a minute.
Well, come on.
- Did I hurt you any? - Well, you didn't do me any good.
Come on.
A cup of coffee and sinker for one.
I never eat till noon. It gives me indigestion.
- Just make that two coffees. - That'll be ten cents.
That's all right.
It's right here someplace.
- Holy Boses. - What's the matter?
I must have spent id at that owl wagon.
- I'll never get rich. - Oh, gee.
You're a little richer than you were.
Hundreds of miles from everything, cut off from the world, a taste of human kindness.
I'll never forget it as long as I live. What town is this?
- Las Vegas, Nevada. - Las Vegas, Devada. This is the busy...
- Las Vegas! You mean Las Vegas? - What about it?
Is there a land yacht waiting here?
Land yacht? You mean that thing?
That's perfectly wonderful, Mr. Sullivan.
I rejoice in your experience.
- And where does this gentleman live? - Just up there by the tracks.
- Give him $100. Never mind who from. - That's swell.
- A great human-interest story. - It'll probably ruin him.
He'll give turkey dinners to every slug that comes in... and never hit the jackpot again.
All right, all right.
Buy the kid here a few clothes, and meet me in Kansas City, someplace near the station.
I'm going the hard way. So long, gang.
Just a minute, please. Sit down!
- But listen, Doc! - You listen.
It's three days in bed, minimum.
- This is just a cold shot. You won't even feel it. - Yow!
- I haven't time to spend three days in bed. - You'll take the time.
You'll get to Kansas City just as soon, and you can imagine... that you went there on your cow snatcher, or whatever you used.
What have you got an imagination for?
- Here's something for you. - What's that?
It's Christmas. So long.
Come in!
Here's a wrapper for you and some slippers.
- What? - A wrapper.
Oh, thanks.
There's some makeup in the medicine cabinet.
- Thanks. I can use it. - You sure can.
Yes, sir, Mr. LeBrand, he's in the next room taking a little snooze.
He looks great. This whole thing is doing him a power of good.
- Come in. - Hello. Feel better?
No, I'm sore. There's nothing the matter with me but a little fever.
Even if I did get sick, they could've sent me to some free hospital.
Wherever they send you. It would have been very interesting.
They give you a nice free burial too, at Potter's Field.
"Free burial. " Why does everybody exaggerate everything so much?
I've got a little cold in my head.
You take a dose of salts, and there you are.
- It's because you're a very valuable man. - Bushwah.
- You make very lovely pictures. - Phooey.
- It's a funny thing, how everything... keeps shoving me back to Hollywood or Beverly Hills...
Or this monstrosity we're riding in... almost like gravity.
As if some force were saying, "Get back where you belong.
You don't belong out here in real life, you phony, you. "
You're a little feverish.
Maybe there's a universal law that says, " Stay put.
As you are, so shall you remain. "
Maybe that's why tramps are always in trouble.
They don't vote. They don't pay taxes.
They violate the law of nature.
You look very pretty in that outfit.
Maybe that's why they don't want trailer colonies.
- Or am I getting a bit profound? - You're getting a bit hot.
Your hand is very cool.
But nothing is going stop me...
I'm going to find out how it feels to be in trouble, without friends, without credit, without checkbook, without name... alone.
- And I'll go with you. - How can I be alone if you're with me?
Yes, sir, Mr. LeBrand. It's all finished.
the greatest expedition of modern times, almost the greatest sacrifice ever made by human man.
- Good morning, Joseph. - Yes, ma'am.
- Good morning. - Good morning.
He's all washed up, except tonight he's going through for a quick tour.
He's taking $1,000 in $5.00 bills... and he's going to hand them out to these tramps in gratitude for what they done for him.
Now is that a story?
Does that give you a lump in your throat, or does that give you a lump in your throat?
- Hello. - Hello.
Tired? No, no. I was just thinking.
Well, here we are at the end of the adventure.
I'll go down tonight and give them a little money, and that winds it up.
Now, what do you want to do?
Do you want to go home or take another crack at Hollywood?
- Well, I... - with a nice, fat letter to Lubitsch?
I'd sort of like to...
go where you go.
I mean, I'd sort of hoped that you'd...
Well, I mean, that you'd want us to go on together a little longer, now that we kind of got used to each other.
- Of course I would, if I wasn't married. - Who's married?
Didn't you know that? I thought everyone had heard of my misfortune.
- Of course I didn't. - What do you mean?
As if I'd snatched you away from your loving grandmother.
- Are you in love with her?
- That vulture? - Then why did you marry her?
- Income tax. - Income tax? - It was supposed to save me $24,000 a year.
It's what's called a joint return. It's California law.
Each one pays half, and the total is less than the aggregate surtax, so the surtax is less than the something or other.
It was an idea of my business manager's.
- I think it's disgusting. - It wasn't supposed to be romantic.
It was supposed to save me $12,000 a year, but it didn't.
- Turned out she couldn't live on $12,000 a year.
- Good. - Lovely. She had to have $24,000.
- Good. Don't keep saying "good" all the time, or I'll poke you in the nose.
- Good. - Now, listen.
So I demanded the divorce she'd promised me.
And she told you to go fry an egg.
She said it would break her mother's heart.
Some fine advice your business manager gave you.
I found out why. He was getting half.
- And you really can't get a divorce ever?
- Never. You can't get a divorce without collusion, and she won't collude.
I guess I ought to go home, then.
You could still have that letter to Lubitsch.
Could I still come and push you in the pool sometimes?
- Of course you could. - I guess that's better than nothing.
There, there, there. My gracious.
Here are the $5.00 bills, Mr. Sullivan.
Hello, Johnnie.
Get me two tickets on the midnight plane.
Two tickets? Oh, two tickets! Yes, indeed, Mr. Sullivan.
- They're pretty, aren't they?
- Uh-huh. - Do you want one?
- Yes. Here. You can have two of them.
Did you cancel the plane tickets?
They cancel themselves. I'm gonna give him just 15 minutes more, and then...
I'm sure he's all right.
He probably got interested in a revival meeting or something and...
Hello? Yes, Doc.
Not in the hospitals, huh?
Sure. I guess that's all you can do.
Anyway, he didn't have an accident.
Oh?
He isn't, huh?
Val has covered the police stations.
- Okay. - I guess you can come back now.
I should have gone with him. I knew he'd get into trouble without me.
- I told him that...
- I'll gonna give him just 12 minutes more,
Then I'm gonna lay it in LeBrand's lap and let him figure it out.
- Sully'll be awfully sore if you...
- Let him be sore.
I got a job too, you know. If LeBrand ever found out...
- He came back the last time. - He didn't have reservations on a plane or people waiting.
- You don't know him like I know him.
- Is that so? I guess I know him better than...
- Yeah? - Say, I'm down here to the morgue.
They got a guy in a basket. You can't tell who he is.
Did the boss have any identification?
Did he have any identification that you know of?
Well, he had...
I think he said he had...
Who is that?
- Have they found him? - Take it easy. We gotta check everywhere.
- What identification did he have? - In the soles of his shoes...
I think there was a card between the soles of his shoes.
Look in the soles of his shoes, between the leather.
He's coming now. I can hear his footsteps.
There's a card here. It's kind of hard to read. It's all splattered.
- He's dead? What do you mean, he's dead? - What do you think it means?
What do you send him on jobs like this for? I've got a good mind to sue you.
- Do you think I like it any better than you do?
- I will sue you! I'll teach you to...
Operator? Operator, I was talking with Kansas City.
She's gonna sue me.
I suppose I ought to fire the whole bunch of you.
Somehow I don't feel like firing anybody.
Well, there's no use your hanging around here!
Get your things together and leave this afternoon!
- I'll fly back. - Yes, sir!
I'd like you to come with us, my dear.
Jones has explained to me.
You were his last discovery... his last gift to the world.
We'll take care of you always.
She didn't hear you.
- What's the idea, riding into the yard?
- Huh? I said, what's the idea, riding into the freight yard?
- Lay off, will you? - I've got a good mind to run you in for trespassing.
Shut up, you dumb cluck. Can't you see I'm sick?
Come on, get out of here, you dirty rat!
- Go on, go on! - Don't do that again.
- That's telling him, 'bo. - Don't do what again?
Come on. Come on, get going!
Trespass. Resisting arrest.
- Atrocious assault and battery with intent to kill. - Huh?
What? - What did he say? - We object, Your Honor.
- My client had been injured and denies all knowledge. - Objection overruled.
- Trespass and resisting arrest.
- Object, your honor. The man was a railroad employee, not an officer of the law.
- Sustained. - Trespass and atrocious assault.
- Objection, Your Honor. - Objection overruled.
Get down to business. Prisoner at the bar.
Prisoner at the bar!
- Answer when you're spoken to.
- Huh? - Do you plead guilty or not guilty?
- Huh?
Guilty or not guilty to trespass and atrocious assault... with a rock upon the person of the employee of the railroad.
I guess I hit him, all right, the way my hand feels.
I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.
I'll pay any damages you like.
Sorry. So you still refuse to give your name?
It'll come back to me in a minute.
I have such an awful headache. I'm all mixed up.
We plead guilty, Your Honor, with extenuating circumstances... due to temporary insanity, and throw ourselves on the mercy of the court.
Huh? What? What did he say?
Stand up. Stand up!
Stand up.
Prisoner at the bar, these are parlous times, and we have no desire to be severe.
- Just a minute.
I...
- Silence! When confronted with violence and hoodlumism, the court has no alternative.
Since you still refuse to remember your name... but have pleaded guilty to trespass and atrocious assault,
I will be as lenient as my conscience permits... and not impose upon you the maximum penalty your crimes ordinarily permit.
Richard Roe, I sentence you to six years at hard labor... as prescribed by the laws of our sovereign state.
Six years? What's he talking about?
- You got off easy. - Wait a minute. I gotta get to a phone.
- I have to send a...
- Come on. - Wait a minute. I'm all mixed up!
Mister, new man.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hi, Jake. - Put him in 13. - Just a minute, boys.
I want to... You speak when you're spoken to around here.
Hold up your arm and wait. - Listen, you...
- You say "Mister" when you're talking to me.
- Put him in 13 and find him a bunk.
- Come on. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Them cost me $16.50.
- Another Richard Roe, eh? - There seems to be a lot of them.
- How's everything at the house, Charlie?
- Fine, Jake. - Give my regards to the missus. - I'll do that little thing.
- I gotta get out of here. - Take it easy, boy.
I'm John L. Sullivan, a Hollywood director.
- Somebody slugged me. I gotta get out of here.
- A Hollywood what? - Take it easy, will you? You're gonna lose your privilege.
No letters, no smokes, no writing. You don't want that.
I want a lawyer. You get me to a telephone.
There's a telephone right down there.
They can't do things like this to people.
Put 'em in a pigsty. Pipe down, will you, please, before he hears.
I want a lawyer. I demand my right to have a lawyer!
Did you hear that? He demands a lawyer.
You starting in again?
You're gonna be here a long time, see?
And you gotta learn, and learn quick.
Chain him in.
No privilege, fresh guy.
We're going to the picture show Sunday.
Good news. You want to see the picture show Sunday?
We're going to the picture show.
We're going to the picture show Sunday. They asked us over again.
- When can I write a letter? - When you get your privilege back.
How long will that take?
That all depends on the Mister.
He's all right if you take it nice and quiet.
How long does it take him to make up his mind?
Take it easy, will you, or you'll never get it.
Look out!
Who gave you leave to read the paper? You won't learn, huh?
- It's about me. I just happened to see it.
- Shut up! Turn around. Turn around!
Put your hands behind you.
- Put him in the sweat box. - For how long, Mister?
- Till I tell you. Are you gonna start now? - No.
I mean no, sir. Then get moving!
Get back to your work. What do you think this is, a vaudeville show?
Tastes good, don't it?
I'll try to get him to let you off early.
I ain't supposed to do this.
- Water. - You'll be all right.
You got to learn, that's all.
It ain't so easy at first, but after a while you don't mind.
We ain't so bad off. He ain't bad, according to his lights.
He has to deal with some pretty tough hombres.
He got us chicken last Thanksgiving... and some turkey once for Christmas.
And there ain't another Mister takes his gang to the picture show.
Maybe...
Maybe if I ask him, he'll let you go the picture show Sunday.
Wouldn't that be something?
All right, Charlie.
Let it down easy, Charlie.
Charlie's a little anxious.
Brothers and sisters, once again we're gonna have a little entertainment.
I don't have to tell you what it is.
The sheet kind of gives it away.
And once again, brothers and sisters, we're going to share our pleasure... with some neighbors less fortunate than ourselves.
Won't you please clear the first three pews so they may have seats.
And when they get here, I'm gonna ask you once more, neither by word, nor by action, nor by look... to make our guests feel unwelcome.
Don't draw away from them or act high-toned.
- For we is all equal in the sight of God. - Amen!
And He said, "Let him who is without sin...
" cast the first stone.
"The chains shall be struck from them!
"The lame shall leap.
"The blind shall see!
And glory in the coming of the Lord. "
Let's give our guests a little welcome.
? When Israel was in Egypt land?
? Let my people go?
? Oppressed so hard?
? They could not stand?
? Let my people?

Will those nearest to the lights kindly rise and dim them, please.
How do?
- Hey. - Huh?
Am I laughing?
You don't suppose this is a gag, do you?
He'd have to be a Houdini to get out of that one.
Well, I wouldn't put it past him.
Don't you understand?
They think I'm dead, and I'm not dead.
Well, that's fine.
Just think what a nice surprise they'll have when you get out.
I haven't time to spend six years.
- But you were sentenced. - I know that, but I still haven't time.
Well, you'll have to find the time.
Look they don't sentence picture directors to a place like this... for a little disagreement with a yard bull.
- Don't they?
- No. Oh.
- Well, then, maybe you ain't a movie director.
- Huh? Maybe that idea just come to you...
- when you got hit on the head, maybe. - Now, look...
We used to have a fella here once that thought he was Lindbergh.
He used to fly away every night... but he was always back in the morning.
Don't I look like a picture director?
'Course I never seen one.
You look more like a soda jerk, or maybe a plasterer, maybe.
But...
- If ever a plot need a twist, this one does.
- Huh? - I gotta get my picture in the paper. - That would be swell.
Then you could paste it over your bunk.
What kind of people get their pictures in the paper?
Ball players?
Girls? They take 'em with their legs crossed.
I cut one out once. She had a...
She was sitting...
When you die, if you was important enough.
I've had that.
Murderers?
There was a swell picture of a friend of mine.
He was a lodge brother.
They called him "the blowtorch killer. "
That's it. That's it!
You tell the Mister I'm ready to make a full confession.
- Now, wait a minute.
- Come on. - Now, take it easy. - There isn't a moment to lose.
- Now, look...
- I'm... My conscience has got me.
- You're gonna get...
- I want to confess to the murder of John L. Sullivan.
- Wait a minute! - I killed John L. Sullivan!
- I killed John L. Sullivan! - I'm telling you, you're doing the wrong thing.
- I'm a murderer! - Will you listen to me before somebody...
I killed John L. Sullivan!
- I'm so happy. - So am I!
- I said, I'm so happy!
- What? Your wife got married last week.
Who got buried last week?
She got married last week!
My wife? You say they buried her?
No, she got married. She married your business manager.
- She married him?
- Yes! - He married her?
- Yes! - But how? - Because you were dead.
- Dead? - Dead.
- Do you suppose she'll give you a divorce?
- Give it to me? She'll beg me for it. Don't you understand?
She's got to give it to me.
Otherwise it's bigamy, unfaithfulness, alienation of affection, corpus delicti.
- And then you'll be free. - Then I'll be free.
But not for long, I hope.
Just a moment, gentlemen!
Sully, I just want to tell you that O Brother, Where Art Thou?
is gonna be the greatest tragedy ever made.
- Well, I...
- The world will weep! Humanity will sob.
It'll put Shakespeare back with the shipping news.
Quiet!
Your personal courage, your sacrifice... the lengths to which you went to sample the bitter dregs of vicissitude... will make O Brother, Where Art Thou?
positively... - I'm sorry to disappoint you. - You're sorry to disappoint me?
Yes, and I say it with some embarrassment, but I don't want to make O Brother, Where Art Thou?
You don't want to make O Brother, Where Art Thou?
No. I say it with some embarrassment. I want to make a comedy.
You say it with some embarrassment?
He doesn't want to make O Brother, Where Art Thou? He wants to make a comedy.
He don't mean that, boss. He's still a little stir crazy.
- Oh, yes, I do. Oh, no I'm not! - You're joking, aren't you?
- It's in bad taste, but it's a joke?
- No. But it's had more publicity than the Johnstown flood.
- What are we gonna do? - Oh, brother.
Why don't you want to make O Brother, Where Art Thou, Sully?
In the first place, I'm too happy to make O Brother, Where Art Thou?
In the second place, I haven't suffered enough to make O Brother, Where Art Thou?
- You haven't suffered enough? - He hasn't suffered enough?
- But Sully! - I'll tell you something else.
There's a lot to be said for making people laugh.
Did you know that's all some people have?
It isn't much, but it's better than nothing in this cockeyed caravan.
1871 then?
No, Father was born in 1872.
How much older than Mom?
Eight years.
Then he is 69.
So, Mom was born in...?
The year of Dragon.
Eight years since we last gathered. For Father's 61st Birthday.
You were small then.
You wore a sky-blue hair ribbon.
You still remember it?
You looked nice wearing it.
I wished I'd been old enough to wear one.
You're old enough to get married now.
And Mom's 61 now.
Right.
I never thought you would marry my brother.
I didn't know you had a brother, either.
Did you want to?
May be no.
Hello!
Hello, nice to meet you!
Ryokichi?
He is here.
I stopped off on the way.
How are you?
Good, thank you.
I like your sash.
A gift from my husband's co-worker.
Yours?
From mom, she wore it when she was 22 or 23.
She wore such subdued sashes when young?
The photographer is here?
What about Shojiro?
He often fails, Dad does not trust him.
So, we don't consider him
Everyone is here?
Yes, you are the last.
I will go to congratulate Mother.
Mitsuko?
She is with Mother.
In the living room.
Good afternoon.
Hello.
It's been a while.
You look well.
What have you done?
We went home.
Nowhere to go?
What happened then?
I made a mistake.
That was the right answer, my sister is 3 years younger than me.
I wrote:
My sister is 3 years old and younger than me.
You did? That was wrong.
Grandpa, will the teacher pass me?
I doubt it.
Grandma?
I wonder.
Hello.
Hello.
It has been a long time, father.
Yes.
You look well.
Thanks.
Happy birthday Mum!
Thanks, thank you for your gift.
I am wearing it now.
It's like yours.
Isn't it too red?
I turned 61 years old.
That means, I returned to babyhood.
Another gift.
Really?
Thanks.
This is for dad.
For me?
Thanks.
Come here to your aunt.
Everyone is here. Come to the garden.
Have you called taxis?
Yes, three.
Let's take pictures and eat.
Will you come?
I will.
Then, let's go!
Let's go!
Dad!
Mum!
Here!
Ayako?
Are we all here?
Really? Where is Shojiro?
Call him?
I will go.
Shojiro!
What are you doing?
We are all ready. Really? Hurry!
Change your clothes. This is okay. Wear a suit.
They are all in the garden.
Which tie?
Any tie will do.
Be quick.
We are going out too.
We will eat lunch together, we called a taxi.
You look lovely.
Hurry!
I praised you.
Uncle!
What's keeping you?
Hurry, grandpa is mad.
Don't scare me.
Were you asleep?
No!
You sleep too much, hurry up.
Act quickly!
Nope!
Hurry, or I will kill you.
Coming.
Shojiro?
He is coming.
He never changes.
Here he comes.
Run!
Hurry!
Sorry!
You stand there.
Everyone is ready?
Sorry to keep you waiting!
Will you move to the left?
A bit more.
Here we go, move a little more.
Don't laugh! Here we go! Thank you!
Let's go over there.
Have my parents come home?
Yes!
Shojiro?
He came home but went out again.
Where?
Don't know
I'm back.
Right.
Sorry to be late, I went to see Tokiko
Did you come straight home?
Mother and I had some tea.
We walked to Hibiya Park.
The flowers were lovely.
We heard music at the hall.
How nice, you two alone, after such a long time.
Yes, When was it we went to view flowers together.
Two years after the Great Earthquake.
The 1923 quake?
Years ago.
More than ten years ago.
So many years?
I was happy today.
My entire family came. I am glad I live long.
The food was delicious, wasn't it?
What food?
With white sauce.
You asked for more.
That sure was good.
Want something to eat?
Shall I have an apple pie?
Please do, change first.
Excuse me!
I feel fine, my face still feels hot.
You drink too much.
The sake was tasty, listen.
Old people have joy in their own way, right?
Ryokichi is in high school by now.
Life is fun.
You will soon have more grandchildren.
My glasses...
I feel so good, I am drunk.
Give me some water.
A wet towel too.
Yes, thanks!
Anybody?
Please give me a glass of water and towel.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
A little painful.
Are you alright?
Want some water?
It's nothing serious. Don't bother!
Will you loosen my sash for me?
Are you all right?
Someone help!
Setsuko!
Make his bed.
Dad is ill.
What happened?
Call the doctor.
Hurry, bring some ice.
Hello?
Yes, they are here.
Wait, hello?
A phone call from your parents' house.
They said your father is ill, and ask you to come right away.
What happened?
They hung up?
Yes, it sounded urgent.
Call a taxi.
It's so sudden, isn't it?
He was so active today.
Will you phone them to make sure?
Hello?
What did the doctor say?
That's bad. Where's Shojiro?
He is not home?
Did you look for him?
He is hopeless! How is father?
I will come now. Be strong, Setsuko.
I am going out.
My clothes.
That one?
The one I wore earlier today.
That sash too.
Give me that.
I think I need one more.
I hope I won't.
Prepare one more clothes.
Tell Ryokichi to stay home.
A phone call from your parents' house.
Your father is ill.
They want you to come right away.
When?
Now.
They want us?
What's happened?
What did they say?
It sounded serious.
Shall we go now?
Let's get inside first.
Make strong coffee.
May be we have to sit up all night.
Drink more coffee.
Am I bushed?
Will he be all right?
He is already 69.
A Chinese philosopher said a man understands life at fifty, and enjoys life at seventy.
It's so upsetting. It came so suddenly.
It's sake, right?
I have told you so many times.
Do something.
Thanks for everything.
You must be tired, why not rest?
Lie down for awhile.
I am fine.
You still have a long way to go.
Take care.
About the schedule...
The funeral will be held on this day.
Mr. Hatakeyama will preside.
That day?
The temple priest said it's the best day.
And death notices... we have asked five newspapers.
That, and that...
And also this.
Have you written this?
Yes, it will be published tomorrow.
Thanks, you take a rest too.
You must be very tired and sad.
I am fine.
Are you tired? No. Too sudden.
I cannot accept it. Take care. Welcome back.
I am back.
Don't cry.
Don't drop any tear again.
Don't cry.
It's so sudden.
Where are you?
In Osaka.
I saw today's paper.
When?
7:36AM.
What is the reason?
Heart diseases.
Painful?
Very.
Sake killed him, he drank too much.
How is Mum?
Fine?
I will go to pray for Father.
Don't cry, it's over.
Enough.
Uncle.
I have taken a day off.
Your grandfather has passed away?
I have not yet seen him.
Right.
I sat so long my legs hurt.
Grandma's nose was red.
Right.
We will play later.
I am back.
Where were you?
In Osaka.
Carefree man!
I never thought this would happen.
You should tell me where you have gone.
We looked for you.
I'm very sorry.
I wanted to fish suddenly.
You can't go fishing at that time.
I don't.
The sea was tough.
I quit and come home.
Did he leave his last words.
No!
Didn't he complain about me?
May be he was in too much pain to do so. I see. What's this?
Tea leaves to keep me awake.
Please give me some.
You have lost some weight.
Go to sleep.
I am fine.
Really? Are you okay?
I slept during the day.
Where is mother?
We made her go to bed.
Good. It would be trouble if she gets sick too.
Go to sleep, let's take turns to sleep.
Is there any food?
Hungry.
Make rice ball for me.
Big one.
Tomorrow is another day.
I am back, mother.
You are back?
Sorry!
I didn't expect too.
I was the source of his worries.
Yet I wasn't here when he died.
After all, I haven't given him anything.
I might have, if he lived longer.
I regret now.
Sorry.
Among these things, the firm Dad had been close to went bankrupt.
He'd drawn notes for huge sums for it.
We were surprised.
He didn't draw them recently.
He had been postponing their due date.
We are morally responsible for their payment.
We can't pay the entire amount.
But we must pay at least half.
He was very powerful in the economic world.
But his fame caused this disaster.
Dad was a man with a pure heart and clean hands.
He always was.
Now, we must be satisfied.
I spoke to Suzuki too.
We will sell everything, this house, land...
To pay his note.
I am sorry to make you come for this bad news.
What do you think about it?
No matter how, we have no choice.
How is sister?
We have no choice.
Your comment?
We have no choice.
Shojiro.
I agree.
What about mother and Setsuko?
They can move here.
Can't they stay till Setsuko gets married.
The sooner the better, right.
That house?
It's really old, only the land worth money.
And you?
Don't worry about me.
Enough?
Do you think I can manage?
Yes, if we do it properly.
Here's a list of these paintings and curios.
Some of them are quite valuable.
No 36, Flowers and birds in Autumn.
Shen-Nan-Pin.
Yes, by Shen-Nan-Pin.
No 37, Waterfall Viewing.
Who?
An ancient Chinese poet.
No 38, Mt Muji.
Hoitsu Sakai.
No 40, Snow Over Pines.
No 43, Plate with Narcissus Motifs.
A phone call for Mr. Shojiro.
Excuse me.
862 items, some junks are included.
Any tea ceremony bowls?
I want one.
Hello?
Fine, I am coming.
I will be right there.
I feel really sorry.
He was a good customer.
Too sudden.
How old was he?
He was not too old.
But he was not young anymore.
It's sake's fault.
Don't drink too much.
I won't.
Drink some.
No thanks, enjoy yourself.
More sake.
You were not there?
When?
When your dad passed away? I was. Liar.
Got some?
Nonsense!
We all know.
Do you think it is too sudden?
Of course.
He was a good father.
He was scary too.
I don't think so.
Sure, and he died so abruptly.
He pitched the first ball at a baseball game.
His ball bounced twice on the ground.
I was surprised.
He'd practiced how to pitch.
He was not good at sports.
But he was a good archer.
Yes, he practiced everyday.
I got up early to help him.
He would be in a good mood at such times.
You sold his books, right?
The one you brought here.
Yes!
I called a secondhand bookstore.
It can sell a good price.
Where did the money go?
We spent it on drinking.
You stole his telescope too, didn't you?
The long one.
Enough!
That wristwatch.
Stop it, enough!
He has already passed away.
He didn't know...
I doubt.
He knew it but he did not tell you.
It was useless to tell me.
I don't agree.
He was a good father.
Yes.
Father is such a nice man.
I hope he can live longer.
Take care of yourself.
If you're dead, you cannot drink anymore.
Can I live until 70?
You can.
Why?
They say, "Bad boys live long".
Then I will be a bad boy.
You're already bad.
Am I?
Why?
What are you doing?
I am fine
Strange, right?
I wasn't sad when he died.
But now I remember those trivial things.
Father and I ate here.
In this room.
He sat here, I there.
At this hour, too.
The sunlight like this.
This sake cup too.
There was a fly.
It landed on his ear.
He shooed it away, but it soon came back.
Men cry at odd times.
Come to think of it, bad sons cry easily, right.
I'll go there.
Where?
Tianjin in China.
I would like to get a job there.
Are you sure?
I have been thinking for so long, I want to find a job.
I don't have a house.
Any work will do. I just want to work.
I want to start over.
Not because father died, it's been my wish.
Decided?
Almost.
When will you go?
As soon as it's decided.
So, you will go?
We are going to lose you.
A good man.
Eat what you can't eat there.
Let's order more sake.
Good idea.
This is very valuable.
It sure is.
What do you think?
Is No 627 here?
No 627.
Here it is, it's in a box.
Show me.
Here it is.
This is the one.
It's very good.
I must pack. Please see to this.
Alright.
Excuse me.
Enough?
Thanks.
Finished?
Why not take this coat too?
No thanks.
It's cold there.
I don't think it's that cold.
That is new.
Really? If you insist.
Thanks.
How about your ticket?
I have bought it.
The other day I went to Osaka.
I will pass there and go as far as Tianjin.
Life's unpredictable.
Take care!
Weather is unsteady there.
Don't worry.
Drink only boiled water.
He is not a child anymore, mother.
Take good care of yourself.
You take care of yourself, too.
We will not meet for a while.
When can we meet next?
Maybe we will get together only after I die.
Nonsense, never talk like that.
You will live long and see more happy times.
You think so?
Of course you will.
Right?
You must.
Tianjin is not so far. Take a plane.
The trip is much shorter than a domestic train ride.
Really?
Sure, don't worry.
Take a bath.
Please go.
Don't forget anything.
Setsuko, please help him.
Give me that.
You'd better forget that marriage proposal.
I am sorry for you. Please give up.
He cancelled it just because Dad died.
I am glad he did.
I don't want you to marry such a heartless man.
Forget it.
Mum is very worried.
I will find a better man for you.
One who has a good build and is kind.
But he's not very handsome.
A guy like me.
Right, keep this smile.
Don't worry.
I will write to you from China, you too.
Tell me everything.
After you move in with Soichiro you will have lots of inconveniences.
You have to be patient.
Be nice to mother.
I will work hard this time.
I really will, you try hard too.
Take good care of mother.
I think she will not get used to this.
You are crying again.
I can't leave with this.
Take good care of mum.
Sure, don't worry.
Will they really come?
Yes, there is no better method to care for them.
Where will mother and Setsuko stay?
Upstairs.
How about me?
Downstairs.
Where is my luggage?
Leave it upstairs. No. Then, bring them downstairs.
Chizuko's house is bigger.
Maybe.
I am the eldest son.
It may be inconvenient, but please put up with it.
Not just me, they may find it crowded too.
Setsuko has brought many things.
And the maid.
They will bring that hill myna bird.
Pull that part.
What did sister say?
Has she complained?
I have made a big mistake.
The flowers are too beautiful I picked one.
You shouldn't!
Kazuko loves them so much.
I didn't know it then.
They are special species.
They are so lovely.
I was ignorant.
That part.
The madam wants you.
Mother, here is the needle.
Going out?
Yes, you know Tanimoto, don't you?
She is in town now.
I invited her here this evening.
Will you go out with mother?
Staying here, she will only be annoyed.
Stay out till 7 or 8. How about it?
I am sorry to make you do it.
You will go to Ginza, right?
Will you do me a favour?
Have some cake and fruit delivered.
What type?
I will bring some.
And sandwiches.
Sandwiches?
Shall I make them myself?
Don't bother Order them, for 6 people.
Excuse me!
Sorry to bother you!
It's alright.
Don't give any to Mitsuko, all right?
Never do that.
Tell mother not to, either.
Sweets give her the trots.
I will go, see you later.
Clean the place and water the flowers.
Will you take the bird upstairs.
I don't want it to bother us.
I will do it.
Where shall we go?
Let me think.
Where?
Hibiya Park.
How about Ueno Zoo?
You go alone, enjoy yourself.
Don't worry about me!
I think I will go to see Chizuko.
I haven't seen her for a while.
You go to Ginza.
Then we will go separately.
Have a good time.
I will go to see Tokiko.
Good idea, be careful on the way.
You too!
Shall I give you some?
Yes, please.
Sister didn't give me money.
Thank you!
Take care!
Hello! Welcome. Such a long time.
Where is Madame?
She went out for a tea ceremony lesson.
Oh!
She has a lesson every day.
Oh, I remember.
Shall I phone her?
No, everyone's fine?
Grandma.
Hello.
Hello, you are alone.
No need to go to school?
No, come to my room.
I have something to show you.
Let's go.
You have grown, haven't you?
The tallest in your class?
Take a look.
Can you see?
Nice, huh?
Something messy.
Guess what?
Tell me.
How should I know that?
It's simple. My snot.
Looks great, huh?
Want to see more?
No thanks.
What happened at your school?
It's great!
Why stay home?
I am playing hookey, don't tell mom.
Why?
I had a fight yesterday.
What happened?
They fooled me.
They will get back at me.
It that the only reason?
You should go to school.
Who's there?
Get out.
Here, have some tea.
Shut the door.
Ryokichi...
Don't skip school just like that.
Will you tell mom?
You'll do it again?
Will you tell her?
Let us make a deal.
Don't do this again.
Apologize to your teachers later, alright?
You sure?
Don't tell mom, okay?
Don't worry, I promise you
I am going to have my lunch.
I will give you half.
Take this.
I will eat first.
Be careful.
How to use the microscope?
Again? Don't.
You eat first, I will eat that.
Can you stay longer?
Let's play together. Mom will be home late.
I am going to visit your grandpa's grave.
I go with you.
Really?
He must be happy.
He loves you.
Let's go together quickly.
Hurry.
Who makes your lunch every morning?
The maid.
Delicious?
Good!
Have some tea.
How are you?
Sorry to make you come.
Busy?
It's okay, how is your mother?
Fine, thanks.
It's been a long time.
Mother sends her regards.
What do you do every day?
Me?
Various things.
Housework, I clean the house and cook.
I mended the quilts today.
You do that, too?
Yes. I am quite busy.
Look!
I took a day off today.
You do such things? Poor girl.
Why?
Well...
I can't stay the innocent girl forever.
Impressed? Yes, very much. Really?
Is your work hard?
Can I do it, too? Of course. Then let me do it.
Why?
I feel like it, that's all.
I wonder if I can do it.
Don't laugh, I am serious.
How are you recently?
How is your mom?
Are they hitting it off?
Can you tell?
Are they?
No.
I thought so. I am sorry to talk this way.
No one is to blame.
It's just... they are too different in many ways.
I know.
What should I do at such times?
I keep feeling sorry for both of them.
And you?
I am fine. So I will work and live with Mother. I know, but you should think deeply.
You and I are very different.
My father's a mere employee, while... yours was an employer.
You and I...
Born under different environment.
Do you think you can live like me?
Is it wrong?
I am asking if you have got the courage.
Great courage.
I have courage.
You sure?
Don't you think it will only worry your mother.
She will understand, but...
You'd better consider it well.
I will.
Sorry, I talk too much.
I feel sorry for your mother.
Shall we eat?
I will pay.
Let me treat you. I have money.
Mother gave me some on the street, I was ashamed.
Ashamed? Just for that?
We're different there. Understand?
What'll it be?
Something cheap that tastes good.
And big, right? That's it. How about this?
Which one, then?
It's all right, isn't it?
No. Tokyo is the best.
Really?
I like it there.
We can see mountains, and the sea.
Misuko?
She went to bed.
Food is better there, too.
Did she go to bed?
Yes.
Bright girl.
The food there is better.
Some Tokyo restaurants serve similar food.
But it's not so good.
Welcome back.
I am back
The guests still here?
Has mother come home?
Where is she?
At the kitchen.
I am back
I am late, when did you get back?
Two hours ago.
I thought the guests had gone. So I hurried.
I took a walk with Tokiko.
She sends her regards.
That's nice of her.
What about you?
Chizuko was out. Ryokichi and I visited Father's grave
He carried flowers.
Then he said, "Don't die, grandma".
He is nice.
Take a shower.
How about you?
After Kazuko does.
Why not bathe first?
I will do it later.
You are sleepy, aren't you?
Are they leaving?
It is so late.
Kazuko is in a good mood.
I can tell by how she calls the maid.
The maid thinks so.
They are leaving?
No, they want some tea.
The water's boiling?
These cups?
She called you.
How's sister?
Fine?
Leaving so soon?
Why not stay longer?
Will you be in town long? Yes, we will meet again. The tea...
No need now.
Hope you can stay a little longer.
We will meet soon.
No need, they have left.
Have some?
No, thanks.
Your husband?
He's on a trip.
I will phone you around Friday.
Sorry to stay long.
Good night.
You are back!
The bath's ready?
Have you bathed?
Not yet.
And you?
Not yet.
Why not, it is very late.
We didn't feel like it.
Get my clothes ready.
We will go to bed first.
Good night!
Look at this!
They didn't like it?
It cost a lot.
Tokiko would be mad at this.
The way she ate.
Why bother buying so many?
You be careful!
Bad girl!
Delicious!
I am tired.
Massage for you?
No need.
Tomorrow, I will wash clothes, shampoo, and write to Shojiro.
Let's go to sleep.
Good night!
I saw boiled fish in Ginza, seems delicious.
I want to send some to Shojiro.
But I have no money.
I don't have any too.
What a pity.
I spent the money eating with Tokiko.
You are nice.
Can you go to sleep?
Shall I tell Kazuko to stop?
Never mind.
But you are tired.
The maids must get up early.
What will you do?
I will ask her to stop.
Don't bother!
No problem.
Do as you like, but tell her politely.
Can you stop playing the piano?
Why, noisy?
Mother can't sleep.
Thanks.
I don't mind.
Good night.
Setsuko!
We must be more considerate of each other.
This time I might have been wrong.
Sometimes I have to swallow my complaints because... we live in the same house.
When the guest came this morning, you should have greeted them.
We thought it would disturb them.
Why?
Didn't you tell us to stay out?
Yes, I did.
Then...
If you had stayed out, it's all right.
But when you came back you should have greeted them.
And Tanimoto was one of the guests
Mother knows her, doesn't she?
No one likes to admit she is wrong.
They soon learn what is wrong with other people.
But they must bear it for each other's sake.
Right?
Do you understand?
Understand?
Good night.
They have trouble?
Neither of them is wrong.
It happens because they must live together in that house.
Maybe.
They are in a bad mood sometimes.
Moving may be good diversion for mother.
Fine, I will let them stay here.
Really?
Thank you.
I hope Ryokichi studies hard... even with his Grandmother here, but with her around he might not obey me.
I will warn them about it.
All right.
After staying here, they might move to Ayako's.
Will the maid come, too?
Yes, they will bring lots of things.
And the bird, too.
Want to work?
What about a clerk?
What kind of job do you want?
Don't, your friend may be working.
But you are different.
Don't think so casually.
It is not only your concern.
Please consider us!
Your father would be disgraced.
What will the others think if you go out to work?
Dad died, we may not be well off.
But you have no need to work.
Our situation is not that worse.
Don't think too much.
Your wedding is coming.
Give up this stupid idea.
Understand?
Don't think about it again!
Suppose I went shopping and found you as the clerk.
I will be ashamed.
Are you sure?
Anyone around?
Go clean upstairs. Hey! Where are my clothes?
Please prepare for me.
And a coat.
Going out?
Did my son go to school yesterday?
Every day?
Of course.
But his teacher wants to meet me.
He hasn't been to school.
The teacher said he is often absent.
I wonder what happened.
Any ideas?
Come to think of it.
One day, you were out and he was home.
I asked him why he wasn't at school.
He said he had fought with a friend of his.
When was it?
When I was still living with Soichiro.
Why didn't you tell me?
I should have. I'm sorry.
This might not have happened.
I suppose so. I should've told you.
It's too late for that.
I am sorry
It's no use apologizing.
But I made a promise with him then.
Promise for what?
Not to tell anybody if he behaves himself.
It is unreasonable.
You kept this secret from me?
You should tell me everything.
You didn't scold him?
Yes, I did.
It didn't work. He did it again.
A promise with a little child?
Were you serious?
You should know about children.
You raised many on your own.
I was thoughtless.
Be more careful!
Tell me everything about him.
I want to raise him my way.
But you are only spoiling him.
You are right.
I was wrong, I am sorry and I will be careful.
Just stay away from my son.
Mrs. Toda and Miss Setsuko have arrived.
Show them in.
Hello, Ayako.
How are you, mother?
Glad to see you.
Sorry, I have been going out when you came.
You should have phoned me before.
Yes, sorry.
I don't mind being a little bit late.
How are you Setsuko?
Ayako, can you do me a favour?
What's the matter?
About us.
We would like to move to the villa in Kugenuma.
Why?
No special reason.
It is empty now.
What do you think?
We should live here, but...
Sister and Brother agreed.
And we have decided.
You have decided?
Why go to that place? We have room here.
Thanks.
You think you can do it?
I will try.
It is inconvenient.
Really, I just think you love to stay here.
Not really far away, you can visit us.
It is near the sea. You will like it.
When will you go?
As soon as possible.
We will meet again before you go.
Then we leave first.
Stay awhile.
Why don't you order lunch?
Take care!
Sorry that I must go now.
Here.
Waited long?
A little.
Sorry.
I have a guest.
Who?
Mother and Sis.
For what?
Guess?
It's our turn now?
No, they will move to the villa.
Really?
Should be.
We are lucky, right?
They skipped us.
We wouldn't get on with them, and then?
I said, see you again.
But I feel sorry.
Why?
After I came here, the first thing I sewed... was a baby dress for Setsuko.
Look at her.
She has grown into such a lovely girl.
Yes.
She is really nice.
When she was born, I told Mr. Toda.
It's a girl.
And he said, a girl again?
Girl is worthless.
So I said, "Babies can't be born without women".
He said that he knew and laughed.
Did that happen?
Such a long time ago.
Time flies, doesn't it?
It's already been a year since Mr. Toda passed away.
Yes.
I feel like many years have passed.
A lot of things has happened, I feel tired.
Things change so quickly, don't they?
May be.
Thanks for your help!
That's all right.
Is there any food, I am hungry?
Be nice.
It is tea time.
Anything will do.
It is not Tokyo.
Take a look.
There are some cakes.
I will take some.
Hurry!
Tokiko may come tomorrow evening.
Saturday?
Guess what she will wear?
No idea.
Just one?
A dress.
No, a kimono made from the cloth you gave her.
My prize.
It is too soon.
Will Shojiro come to Father's first death ceremony?
I don't know!
He should come back.
He may be busy.
He lives far away, I just want him is going well.
I hope he can come.
He may not able to come.
Think so?
I am glad everything went well today.
The rain stopped in the morning.
Glad that it didn't rain.
Shojiro came, too.
You never change, we were worried about you.
The sea was so rough, sorry I was late.
Father must be very happy.
Today's sutra was long.
I asked the priest to make it short.
My legs are tired.
Ryokichi couldn't even stand up.
How is life in China?
What do you mean?
Do you go fishing?
No, I am quite busy recently.
You may take a rest.
I will call you later.
Why do Mother and Setsuko live at the villa?
No special reason.
Why don't they live with you?
Have been.
What has happened?
They moved to Chizuko's home.
Then?
They stayed at my house.
And?
They decided to move out.
I don't believe it.
I decided to move.
Please keep out of this, Mother.
Why do you let them live in such place?
When we wanted to sell it you said that it was worthless.
It is too old to live.
I was surprised Mother and Setsuko moved there.
I thought they were happy to live with you.
We had our reason.
What is it?
You were not here.
That's not the reason.
It is the question of your sincerity.
Don't tell me you think Mother's only in the way.
Don't ever think I know nothing.
May be I have trusted you too much.
I should have looked after her myself.
I should have decided it earlier.
Children should be kind and warm to their mother.
But you haven't.
Even for just a year.
Even when we are together today.
Father would not be happy.
Why didn't you ask them to move in?
Mother has decided it.
Why didn't you ask her to come to your place?
Why?
I've thought about it.
Then why didn't you ask her?
But...
No "But", you talk without doing anything.
Where is your sincerity?
How rude!
Who's rude? Leave!
But...
Leave!
Ayako, come here!
Sit down!
You leave too!
Think it over.
Will you leave too?
Of course.
Then go!
Goodbye, my best to Ryokichi.
Soichiro, do you think I am wrong?
If not, please leave.
Go ahead.
You pay for this food later.
Stop crying. It taught them a lesson.
It is best to bawl them out like I did.
I may have ruined Father's death anniversary.
But it will help them get along with each other.
Father would be glad.
Don't cry.
Mother, Setsuko.
Let's eat together.
Everything is going well.
Don't cry again.
Eat something, there is lots of food.
I'll loosen my belt.
Very delicious, mother, eat some.
I can't get this in China.
Eat more, get fat.
Hope I can stay with you.
But it's a very important time for my work.
I can't just leave at this moment.
How about this... both of you go with me.
What do you think?
I am already an old woman.
Age doesn't matter.
Old people climb mountains and visit temples.
What's wrong with you going to Tianjin? Really? Of course!
Just do what you think is best.
Don't mind what people say.
Sticking to appearances, you can't do a thing.
Why not going?
You can relax in China.
You will feel as if the sky were higher there.
Brother and sister have already apologized so you can stay in Tokyo and live with one of them.
But I want you to come with me.
Let's go!
What do you think?
I don't mind.
You don't? Let's decide.
It's nice there.
Well, if you really don't mind.
It's done.
How about you? Yes. If you don't mind, let's go.
It's good, It's really nice.
Let's go together!
It has been decided, right?
This bird, it won't be ignored anymore.
Listen.
Can we talk?
About what?
What is this?
Why don't you get married?
I know a very nice girl.
What do you think?
Do you already have someone you like?
Do you?
No.
Listen, she is a nice girl.
Who?
I have a friend.
Pretty?
Very nice and honest.
I can't believe you have such a friend.
Who?
Tokiko
That ordinary girl?
What do you think?
I am too good for her.
No, she is too good for you.
Am I that ugly?
Mother likes her. So, she is the best for you.
Mother loves her?
Don't mention your mother, do you love her?
Not really.
Don't like her?
Not really.
Then, what is it?
I will leave it up to you, think deeply.
She is not that awful.
Then it's okay?
It's done.
Wait!
It's now my turn to say something.
About your marriage, leave it to me.
I didn't ask too much. You can't either.
A really good and strong man.
A bit homely, though. Someone like me.
You don't like him?
There are so many men for you to choose.
I will pick the best one for you.
Leave it to me.
Take it easy.
Don't look down on me.
Mom, it is Tokiko.
She is here.
Who?
Tokiko, I will talk with her.
You meet her later. No. Why?
I am bashful.
You are lying!
I mean it!
You will meet her, all right?
No, I won't meet her.
Let me handle it.
So do as I say, all right?
I am still bashful.
It is not like you.
Just act cheerfully as usual.
Impossible, this is different.
Everyone has his weakness.
Even a hero.
Many heroes has weaknesses.
No excuses!
I won't see her.
Then I will bring her here.
Thanks for the gift!
It's alright. I hope you like it.
Hello.
Hello
Glad you have come.
Which train?
Towards Shimbashi.
Crowded?
She has brought a gift.
Thank you.
It's for your brother.
Thanks!
What's this?
Something to go with Sake.
So nice, he will like it.
I'll take it to him.
Where is he?
He went out just now.
With the coming of the Second World War many eyes in imprisoned Europe turned hopefully, or desperately toward the freedom of the Americas.
Lisbon became the great embarkation point.
But not everybody could get to Lisbon directly.
And so a torturous, roundabout refugee trail sprang up.
Paris to Marseilles across the Mediterranean to Oran.
Then, by train or auto or foot, across the rim of Africa to Casablanca in French Morocco.
Here, the fortunate ones, through money or influence or luck might obtain exit visas and scurry to Lisbon.
And from Lisbon to the New World.
But the others wait in Casablanca.
And wait and wait and wait.
To all officers:
Two German couriers carrying official documents murdered on train from Oran.
Murderer and possible accomplices headed for Casablanca.
Round up all suspicious characters and search them for stolen document.
Important.
May we see your papers?
I don't think I have them on me.
- In that case, you'll have to come along.
- Wait. It's possible that I... Yes.
These papers expired three weeks ago. You'll have to come along.
Halt!
Halt!
- What on earth is going on there?
- I don't know, my dear. Pardon, monsieur.
Pardon, madame. Have you not heard?
We hear very little, and we understand even less.
Two German couriers were found murdered in the desert.
The unoccupied desert.
This is the customary roundup of refugees, liberals and, of course, a beautiful young girl for Renault, the prefect of police.
Along with these unhappy refugees, the scum of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca.
Some of them have been waiting years for a visa.
I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself.
Be on guard.
This place is full of vultures.
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!
- Thank you.
Thank you very much. - Not at all.
What an amusing little fellow.
Waiter.
- Oh, how silly of me. - What, dear?
I've left my wallet in the hotel.
Perhaps tomorrow we'll be on the plane.
It is good to see you again, Major Strasser.
Thank you, thank you.
May I present Captain Renault, police prefect of Casablanca.
Major Strasser.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Thank you, captain.
It's good to be here.
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
Captain Tonnelli.
The Italian service at your command. That is kind of you.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm.
We Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara.
- Perhaps you weren't referring to weather.
- What else?
The murder of the couriers.
What has been done?
My men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
- But we know already who the murderer is. - Good. Is he in custody?
No hurry.
Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
I've already heard about this café.
And also about Mr. Rick himself.
Waiting, waiting, waiting.
I'll never get out of here.
I'll die in Casablanca.
But can't you make it just a little more?
Please?
Sorry, but diamonds are a drug on the market.
Everybody sells diamonds.
There are diamonds everywhere. 2400.
All right.
The trucks are waiting.
The men are waiting. Everything--
It's the fishing smack Santiago.
It leaves at 1 tomorrow night, here from the end of La Medina.
Third boat. - Thank you. Thank you.
- And bring 15,000 francs in cash.
Remember, in cash.
- Open up, Abdul. - Yes, professor.
- Waiter? - Yes, madame?
Will you ask Rick if he'll have a drink with us?
Madame, he never drinks with customers.
Never. I have never seen it.
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?
Perhaps if you told him I ran the second-largest banking house in Amsterdam.
Second largest? That wouldn't impress Rick.
The leading banker in Amsterdam is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.
We have something to look forward to.
And his father is the bellboy.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, sir. This is a private room.
Of all the nerve. Who do you think--?
I know there is gambling in there. - You dare not keep me out.
- Yes? What's the trouble?
I have been in every gambling room between Honolulu and Berlin.
And if you think I'm going to be kept out of a saloon like this, you're much mistaken.
Excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
Your cash is good at the bar.
What? Do you know who I am?
I do.
You're lucky the bar is open to you.
This is outrageous! I shall report it to The Angriff.
You know, watching you just now, one would think you've been doing this all your life.
- What makes you think I haven't?
- Nothing. - But when you first came, I thought--
- You thought what?
What right do I have to think?
May I?
Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
They got a lucky break.
Yesterday they were just clerks today they are the honored dead.
You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
I forgive you. - Will you have a drink with me?
- No.
I forgot, you never drink with-- I'll have another, please.
You despise me, don't you?
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
But why?
Do you object to the kind of business I do?
But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them.
That's not so bad.
Through ways of my own, I provide them with exit visas.
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.
But think of all the poor devils who can't meet Renault's price.
I get it for them for half.
Is that so parasitic?
I don't mind a parasite.
I object to a cut-rate one.
Well, after tonight I will be through with the whole business.
And I'm leaving, finally, this Casablanca.
Who did you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
Look, Rick.
Know what this is?
Something that even you have never seen.
Letters of transit signed by General de Gaulle.
Cannot be rescinded. Not even questioned.
One moment.
Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than I ever dreamed of.
And then, addio, Casablanca.
I have many a friend in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you are the only one I trust.
Will you keep these for me, please?
- For how long? - Perhaps an hour.
Perhaps a little longer. - I don't want them here overnight.
- Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me.
Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
Waiter. I'll be expecting some people.
If anybody asks for me, I'll be right here.
Rick I hope you're more impressed with me now.
If you'll forgive me, I'll share my good luck with your roulette wheel.
Just a moment.
I heard a rumor those two German couriers were carrying letters of transit.
I've heard that rumor too.
Poor devils. You're right, Ugarte.
I am a little more impressed with you.
- Hello, Rick. - Hello, Ferrari.
How's business at the Blue Parrot?
- Fine, but I'd like to buy your café.
- It's not for sale. - You haven't heard my offer.
- It's not for sale at any price.
- What do you want for Sam?
- I don't buy or sell human beings.
Too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity.
In refugees alone we could make a fortune, if you'd work with me in the black market.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Suppose we do.
When will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
Oh, I like it fine here. - He'll double what I pay you.
- I ain't got time to spend what I make here.
Sorry.
The boss's private stock...
- ...because, Yvonne, I love you.
- Oh, shut up. All right, all right.
For you, I shut up, because, Yvonne, I love you.
Some Germans gave this check. Is it all right?
Where were you last night?
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
- Will I see you tonight? - I never make plans that far ahead.
Give me another.
- Sascha, she's had enough.
- Don't listen to him.
Fill it up. Yvonne, I love you, but he pays me.
- Rick, I'm tired of having you--
- Sascha, call a cab. - We're gonna get your coat.
- Take your hands off me. You're going home. You've had a little too much to drink.
Hey, taxi.
Who do you think you are, pushing me around?
I was a fool to fall for a man like you.
Go with her, Sascha. Be sure she gets home.
And come right back.
Yes, boss.
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis. How extravagant you are, throwing away women.
Someday they may be scarce.
I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne.
Maybe get her on the rebound.
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
If he gets a word in, it'll be a major Italian victory.
The plane to Lisbon.
You would like to be on it?
Why? What's in Lisbon?
The clipper to America.
I've often speculated on why you don't return to America.
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Did you run off with a senator's wife?
I like to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me. It's a combination of all three.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
I came to Casablanca for the waters.
The waters?
What waters?
We're in the desert.
I was misinformed.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.
A gentleman inside has won 20,000 francs and the cashier would like some money.
I'll get it from the safe.
I'm so upset, Rick.
You know I-- Forget it, Emil.
Mistakes like that happen all the time.
I'm awfully sorry.
Rick, there will be some excitement here tonight.
An arrest in your café.
- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.
A murderer, no less.
If you're thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out.
He cannot escape. - I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A wise foreign policy.
Could have made the arrest earlier, at the Blue Parrot.
Out of my regard for you, we're staging it here.
It will amuse your customers.
Our entertainment's enough.
We're to have an important guest here tonight.
Major Strasser of the Third Reich, no less.
We want him to be here when we make the arrest.
A demonstration of the efficiency of my administration.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here?
He certainly didn't come here to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
- Perhaps not. - Here. - It shall not happen again.
- That's all right.
Louis, you got something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it. How observant you are.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
Yeah?
- Have a brandy? - Thank you.
There are many exit visas sold in this café, but we know that you've never sold one.
That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
I thought it was because I let you win at roulette.
That is another reason.
There is a man arrived in Casablanca on his way to America.
He will offer a fortune to anyone who'll furnish an exit visa.
- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.
Rick, that is the first time I've seen you so impressed.
He's succeeded in impressing half the world.
It's my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half.
Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
- Manages what?
- His escape.
- But I just told you--
- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp.
The Nazis have chased him all over Europe.
This is the end of the chase.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Is that a serious offer?
I just paid out 20, and I'd like to get it back.
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor corrupt official.
- Okay.
- Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa.
Or I should say two.
- Why two? - He is traveling with a lady.
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I've seen the lady.
And if he did not leave her in Marseilles or Oran he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
What ever gave you the impression that I might help Laszlo escape?
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you are at heart a sentimentalist.
Laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record.
Let me point out just two items:
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.
In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Maybe.
It seems you're determined to keep Laszlo here.
I see. Gestapo spank.
My dear Ricky, you overestimate the influence of the Gestapo.
I don't interfere with them, and they don't interfere with me.
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.
- I am-- - Major Strasser is here, sir.
- You were saying?
Carl, see that Major Strasser gets a good table, close to the ladies.
I have already given him the best, knowing he is German and would take it anyway.
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.
- Everything is ready, sir. - Go ahead.
- Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening, captain.
- Won't you join us? - Thank you.
- It's a pleasure to have you here, major.
- Champagne and a tin of caviar.
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26, a good French wine.
Very well, sir.
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight, major.
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
I expected no less, captain.
Monsieur Ugarte.
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.
May I first please cash my chips?
Very lucky, huh?
Two thousand, please.
Rick! Rick, help me!
- Don't be a fool.
You can't get away. - But, Rick, hide me.
Do something!
Excellent, captain.
When they come for me, I hope you'll be more of a help.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks, but it's all over now.
Just sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
- How do you do, Mr. Rick?
- How do you do? You already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
Please join us, Mr. Rick.
We are very honored tonight.
Major Strasser is one of the reasons the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.
You repeat Third Reich as though you expected there to be others.
Well, personally, major, I will take what comes.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.
- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.
And that makes Rick a citizen of the world.
I was born in New York City, if that'll help you any.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
There seems to be no secret about that.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
Can you imagine us in London?
When you get there, ask me.
Diplomatist.
How about New York?
Well, there are sections of New York, major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
- Who do you think will win the war? - I haven't the slightest idea.
Rick is completely neutral about everything.
And that takes in the field of women too.
You were not always so carefully neutral.
We have a complete dossier on you.
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country."
The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris. And also we know why you left Paris.
Don't worry, we're not going to broadcast it.
Are my eyes really brown?
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine.
The point is an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
In this case you have no sympathy for the fox?
Not particularly.
I understand the point of view of the hound too.
Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the day we marched in.
And even after that, he continued to print scandal sheets in his cellar.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
I admit he's clever.
Three times he slipped through our fingers.
In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Your business is politics, mine is running a saloon.
Good evening, Mr. Blaine. You see, major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.
Perhaps.
- I reserved a table.
Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.
Two Cointreaux, please.
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.
Victor, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
If we would walk out so soon it would only call attention to us.
Perhaps Ugarte is in some other part of the café.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
You'll find a market there for this ring.
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
- Thank you, but I hardly think... - Perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
- Yes, I'm very interested.
- Good.
What is your name?
Berger, Norwegian. At your service, sir.
I'll meet you in a few minutes at the bar.
We don't want the ring, but thanks for showing it to us.
- Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
- I'm sorry, it is. - Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes? I am Captain Renault, prefect of police.
Yes, what is it you want?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay.
It isn't often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, captain.
The present French administration hasn't always been so cordial.
May I present Miss Ilsa Lund.
I was told you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca.
That was a gross understatement.
You're very kind.
- Won't you join us? - If you will permit me.
Oh, no, Emile, please.
A bottle of your best champagne.
And put it on my bill. It's a game we play.
They put it on the bill, I tear up the bill.
Captain, the boy who's playing the piano...
Somewhere I've seen him.
- Sam?
- Yes. He came from Paris with Rick.
Rick?
Who is he?
- Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's.
Rick is... - Is what?
Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man that, well, if I were a woman and I were not around, I should be in love with Rick.
But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
Excuse me. Major.
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo, may I present Major Strasser.
How do you do?
This is a pleasure I have looked forward to.
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I'm not gracious.
You see, Major Strasser, I am a Czechoslovakian.
You were a Czechoslovakian.
Now you are a subject of the German Reich.
I have never accepted that privilege.
And I'm now on French soil.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
This is hardly the time or place.
Then we shall state another time and place.
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.
With mademoiselle.
Captain, I am under your authority.
Is it your order that we come to your office?
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.
Very well.
A very clever tactical retreat, major.
- This time they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I'm afraid for you.
We've been in difficult places before, haven't we?
I must find out what Berger knows.
- Be careful. - I will. Don't worry.
Monsieur Berger, the ring.
Could I see it again?
Champagne cocktail, please.
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
As you see, it was true every single time.
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.
I'm looking for a man by the name of Ugarte.
He's supposed to help me.
Ugarte cannot even help himself.
He's under arrest for murder.
He was arrested here tonight.
I see.
But we who are still free will do all we can.
We are organized.
Underground, like everywhere else.
Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois.
If you will come--
Will you ask the piano player to come over here?
Very well, mademoiselle.
- How's the jewelry business, Berger?
Check, please.
Too bad you weren't here earlier.
We had quite a bit of excitement, didn't we, Berger?
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.
- My bill.
- No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.
- Hello, Sam. - Hello, Miss Ilsa.
I never expected to see you again.
It's been a long time.
Yes, ma'am.
A lot of water under the bridge.
- Some of the old songs, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.
Where is Rick?
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
- When will he be back?
- Not tonight no more.
He ain't coming--
- Does he always leave so early?
- He never-- Well, he's got a girl up to the Blue Parrot.
Goes up there all the time.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa.
You're bad luck to him.
Play it once, Sam. For old times' sake.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Play it, Sam.
Play "As Time Goes By."
I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa.
I'm a little rusty on it.
I'll hum it for you.
Sing it, Sam.
Sam, I thought I told you never to play--
Well, you were asking about Rick, and here he is.
May I present-- - Hello, Ilsa. - Hello, Rick.
Oh, you've already met Rick, mademoiselle?
Then perhaps you also--
This is Mr. Laszlo.
- How do you do? - How do you do?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
- Won't you join us for a drink? - Rick never--
- Thanks, I will.
- Well a precedent is being broken. Emile.
- Interesting café.
I congratulate you. - I congratulate you.
- What for?
- Your work.
Thank you. I try.
We all try.
You succeed.
She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
I wasn't sure you were the same.
- Let's see, the last time we met--
- Was La Belle Aurore.
How nice. You remembered.
But, of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Not an easy day to forget.
I remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Yes. I put that dress away.
When the Germans march out I'll wear it again.
Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
I suppose we have to thank you for that.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
So it is. We have a curfew in Casablanca.
It would never do for the chief of police to be found drinking after hours.
- I hope we didn't overstay our welcome. - Not at all.
- Your check, sir.
- It's my party.
Another precedent gone.
This has been a very interesting evening.
I'll call you a cab.
Gasoline rationing, time of night.
- We'll come again. - Anytime.
- Say good night to Sam for me. - I will.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
- Good night.
- Good night.
A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.
What sort is he?
I really can't say, though I saw him quite often in Paris.
- Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office.
- We'll be there.
- Good night. - Good night.
Boss?
- Boss, ain't you going to bed?
- Not right now. Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
- You ever going to bed? - No.
Well, I ain't sleepy, either.
Good, then have a drink.
- Not me, boss.
- Then don't have a drink. Boss, let's get out of here.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Please, let's go.
Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
We'll take the car and drive all night.
We'll get drunk.
We'll go fishing, stay away until she's gone.
- Shut up and go home, will you?
- No, sir, I'm staying right here.
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.
That's the way it goes. One in, one out.
- Sam. - Yes, boss?
If it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
What?
My watch stopped.
I bet they're asleep in New York.
I bet they're asleep all over America.
Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world she walks into mine.
- What's that you're playing?
- A little something of my own.
- Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
- No, I don't.
You played it for her.
You can play it for me. - I don't think I can remember--
- If she can stand it, I can.
Play it.
Yes, boss.
Who are you really?
And what were you before?
What did you do, and what did you think?
We said no questions.
Here's looking at you, kid.
A franc for your thoughts.
In America they'd bring only a penny.
I guess that's about all they're worth.
I'm willing to be overcharged.
Tell me.
Well, I was wondering...
Why I'm so lucky.
Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
Why there is no other man in my life?
That's easy. There was.
He's dead.
I'm sorry for asking.
I forgot we said no questions.
Only one answer can take care of all our questions.
Nothing can stop them now.
Wednesday, Thursday at the latest, they'll be in Paris.
Richard, they'll find out your record.
You won't be safe here. I'm on their blacklist already.
Their roll of honor.
Henri wants us to finish this bottle and then three more.
Says he'll water his garden with champagne before he'll let the Germans drink it.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it?
You said it.
Here's looking at you, kid.
My German's a little rusty.
It's the Gestapo.
They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
They're telling us how to act when they come marching in.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
It's pretty bad timing.
- Where were you, say, 10 years ago?
- 10 years ago?
Let's see.
Yes, I was having a brace put on my teeth.
Where were you?
Looking for a job.
Was that cannon fire?
Or is it my heart pounding?
It's the new German 77th, and judging by the sound, only about 35 miles away.
And getting closer every minute.
Here, here, drink up.
We'll never finish the other three.
Them Germans will be here pretty soon, and they'll come looking for you.
And don't forget, there's a price on your head.
I left a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.
It's strange. - I know so very little about you.
- I know very little about you.
Just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
Be serious, darling. You are in danger.
You must leave Paris.
No, we must leave.
Yes, of course. We.
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00.
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.
Not at my hotel.
I... I have things to do in the city before I leave.
I'll meet you at the station.
All right, at a quarter to 5.
Why don't we get married in Marseilles?
That's too far ahead to plan.
Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.
Let's see... What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?
Why not?
The captain on a ship can.
It doesn't seem fair that--
Hey, what's wrong, kid?
I love you so much.
And I hate this war so much.
It's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.
If you shouldn't get away...
If something should keep us apart wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know that I...
Kiss me.
Kiss me as if it were the last time.
Where is she?
Have you seen her?
I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.
But this note came just after you left.
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.
Do you hear me?
Come on, Mr. Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.
Rick, I have to talk to you.
I saved my first drink to have with you.
Here.
- No, Rick. Not tonight.
- Especially tonight.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca?
There are other places.
I wouldn't have come if I'd known you were here.
Believe me, Rick, it's true.
I didn't know. It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed.
I can still hear it.
"Richard, dear, I'll go with you anyplace.
- We'll get on a train and never stop."
- Don't, Rick.
I can understand how you feel.
You understand how I feel.
How long was it we had, honey?
- I didn't count the days.
- Well, I did. Every one of them.
Mostly I remember the last one.
The wild finish.
A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face because his insides have been kicked out.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Does it got a wild finish?
I don't know the finish yet.
Go on, tell it.
Maybe one'll come to you as you go along.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo.
At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life.
A very great and courageous man.
He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals.
Everything she knew or ever became was because of him.
And she looked up to him and worshiped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
Yes, that's very pretty.
I heard a story once.
In fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time.
They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs.
"Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," they'd always begin.
I guess neither one of our stories is very funny.
Tell me who was it you left me for?
Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between or aren't you the kind that tells?
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.
I would suggest you search the café immediately.
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart to let you find them there.
You give him credit for too much cleverness.
My impression was he's just another blundering American.
We mustn't underestimate American blundering.
I was with them when they blundered into Berlin in 1918.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched 24 hours a day.
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he's on his way here.
There is nothing we can do. I'm delighted to see you.
Did you have a good night's rest?
I slept very well.
Strange. Nobody's supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
- May we proceed with the business?
- With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Laszlo, we will not mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.
So far you have been fortunate in eluding us.
You have reached Casablanca.
It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
Whether or not you will succeed is problematic.
Not at all. Renault's signature is necessary on every visa.
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo will receive a visa?
I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
And mademoiselle?
- You needn't be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world.
You may be in Casablanca indefinitely.
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.
- On one condition.
- And that is?
You know the leader of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague Brussels, Amsterdam Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...
- Even Berlin.
- Yes, even in Berlin.
If you will furnish me with their names and whereabouts you'll have your visa in the morning.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year.
- That's honor enough for a lifetime.
- You will give us the names?
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more persuasive methods at your disposal I certainly won't give them to you now.
And what if you track down these men and kill them?
What if you murdered all of us?
From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands would rise to take our places.
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand.
But in one aspect you are mistaken.
You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced. But there is one exception.
No one could take your place if anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
You won't dare to interfere with me here.
This is still unoccupied France.
Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
- Thank you. By the way, monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
I believe you have a message for him?
Nothing important. But may I speak to him now?
You would find the conversation a trifle one-sided.
Signor Ugarte is dead.
I'm making out the report now.
We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being. Good day.
Undoubtedly, their next step will be to the black market.
Excuse me, captain.
Another visa problem has come up.
- Show her in. - Yes, sir.
Sorry, monsieur, we were never to handle the police.
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?
It can be most helpful to know Signor Ferrari.
He pretty near has a monopoly on the black market here.
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.
Thanks.
Don't be too downhearted.
Perhaps you can come to terms with Renault.
Thank you very much, signor. - Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick. The bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.
I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me. I never drink in the morning.
And every time you send my shipment over it's a little short.
Carrying charges, my boy. Carrying charges. Here, sit down.
There is something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
Bourbon.
The news about Ugarte upsets me very much.
You're a fat hypocrite.
You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
Of course not.
What upsets me is that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters are.
Practically no one.
If I had those letters, I could make a fortune.
So could I, and I'm a poor businessman.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters.
I'll handle the entire transaction.
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
And the carrying charges? Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses.
That's my proposition for whoever has those letters.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Rick, I think you know where those letters are.
You're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so too.
That's why I came here.
To give them a chance to ransack my place.
Rick, don't be a fool.
Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
Excuse me, I'll be getting back.
- Morning. - Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
You will not find a treasure like this in all Morocco.
Only 700 francs.
- You're being cheated. - Doesn't matter, thank you.
For friends of Rick's we have a small discount.
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
Doesn't matter.
For special friends of Rick's we have a special discount. 100 francs.
Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.
I have some tablecloths, napkins-- - Thank you. I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
Yes.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket.
I think I'm entitled to know.
Last night I saw what has happened to you.
The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him, he'd understand.
But the one who looked at me with such hatred...
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon. We'll never see each other again.
We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris.
If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca.
Did you run out on me because you knew what it would be like?
Hiding from the police, running away all the time?
You can believe that if you want to.
Well, I'm not running away anymore. I'm settled now.
Above a saloon, it's true but walk up a flight I'll be expecting you.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo.
You'll be there.
No, Rick. No.
You see, Victor Laszlo is my husband.
And was, even when I knew you in Paris.
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that unfortunately I'm not able to help him.
You see, my dear, word has gone around.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am influential and respected.
But it would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.
You, however, are a different matter.
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.
I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while--
Might as well be frank, monsieur.
It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.
We are only interested in two visas.
- Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor. You two will want to discuss this.
Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.
No, Ilsa.
I won't let you stay here.
You must get to America. Believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
But if the situation were different if I had to stay and there were only visa for one would you take it?
Yes, I would.
Yes, I see.
When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there?
When I was sick in Marseilles for two weeks and you were in danger every minute why didn't you leave me then?
I meant to, but something always held me up.
I love you very much, Ilsa.
Your secret will be safe with me.
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.
Not more than 50 francs.
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.
For the present we will go on looking for two visas.
Thank you very much. Well, good luck, but be careful.
- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.
I observe that you, in one respect, are a very fortunate man.
I am moved to make one more suggestion.
Why, I do not know. Because it cannot possibly profit me.
Have you heard about Ugarte and the letters of transit?
Yes, something. Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.
But I'd guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.
But it is worth a chance.
Thank you very much. Good day.
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.
I shall miss that when we leave Casablanca.
Gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, mademoiselle.
- Monsieur. - Good day.
- Here's to you, sir. - Good luck.
- I'd better be going. - My check, please.
I have to warn you, sir.
This is a dangerous place.
Full of vultures. - Vultures everywhere.
Thanks for everything. - Goodbye.
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
I'm sorry.
Monsieur Rick, you are getting to be your best customer.
Well, drinking.
I'm very pleased with you.
You're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
That was some going-over your men gave my place.
We barely got cleaned up in time to open.
I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here.
But I told my men to be especially destructive.
You know how that impresses Germans.
Rick, have you got those letters of transit?
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy or Free French?
Serves me right for asking a direct question.
The subject is closed. It looks like you're a little late.
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
Who knows?
In her own way, she may constitute an entire second front.
I think it's time for me to flatter Strasser a little.
I'll see you later. Sascha!
French 75s.
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.
Starting here and ending here.
We will begin with two.
What did you say?
Would you kindly repeat it?
- What I said is none of your business.
- I'll make it my business.
I don't like disturbances in my place.
Either lay off politics or get out.
You see, captain?
The situation is not as under control as you believe.
We try to cooperate with your government.
But we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
Captain, are you certain which side you're on?
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean.
I blow with the wind and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
And if it should change?
Surely the Reich doesn't admit that possibility?
We are concerned about more than Casablanca.
We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.
Waiting for their chance. Waiting perhaps for a leader.
A leader?
Like Laszlo? I have been thinking.
It's too dangerous to let him go, it may be too dangerous to let him stay.
I see what you mean.
Thank you, Carl.
Thank you, Carl.
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.
To celebrate our leaving for America tomorrow.
Thank you very much.
I thought you would ask me, so I brought the good brandy and a third glass.
At last the day's came!
Frau Leuchtag and I are speaking nothing but English now.
So we should feel at home when we get to America.
A very nice idea.
To America.
To America.
What watch?
- Ten watch.
- Such much?
You will get along beautifully in America.
How is lady luck treating you?
Oh, too bad. You'll find him over there.
- Monsieur Rick? - Yes?
- Could I speak to you, please?
- How'd you get in here?
You're underage.
- I came with Captain Renault.
- I should have known. My husband is with me too.
He is?
Captain Renault's getting broad-minded.
Sit down. Have a drink?
No, of course not. You mind if I do?
Monsieur Rick...
- ...what kind of a man is Captain Renault?
- Like any other man, only more so.
No, I mean is he trustworthy? Is his word--?
- Just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
- He did. Captain Renault did.
I thought so. Where's your husband?
At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visas.
Oh, of course he's losing.
- How long have you been married?
- Eight weeks.
We come from Bulgaria.
Things are very bad there.
The devil has the people by the throat.
So Jan and I, we...
We do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
- So you decided to go to America.
- Yes.
But we haven't much money and traveling is so expensive and difficult.
It was much more than we thought to get here.
And then Captain Renault sees us...
- ...and he is so kind, he wants to help us.
- Yes, I'll bet.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa.
But we have no money.
- Does he know that?
- Yes.
- And he's still willing to give you a visa?
- Yes. - And you want to know...?
- Will he keep his word?
He always has.
You are a man.
If someone loved you very much so that your happiness was the only thing that she wanted in the world and she did a bad thing to make certain of it...
- ...could you forgive her?
- Nobody ever loved me that much.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart that would be all right, wouldn't it?
- You want my advice?
- Yes, please.
Go back to Bulgaria.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America...
Oh, but if Jan should find out. He is such a boy.
In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems.
- Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
- Thank you, monsieur.
- Good evening.
- Good evening. - You see? Here we are again.
- I take that as a great compliment to Sam.
I suppose he means to you Paris of happier days.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
The geography may be a little difficult to arrange.
- Paul, table 30.
- Yes, sir. Right this way, if you please.
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By." I believe that's your favorite tune.
Thank you.
- Two cognacs, please. - Cognac.
Do you wish to place another bet, sir?
No. No, I guess not. Have you tried 22 tonight?
I said 22.
Leave it there.
Cash it in and don't come back.
Are you sure this place is honest?
Honest?
As honest as the day is long.
How are we doing tonight?
A couple of thousand less than I thought there would be.
Monsieur Rick...
He's just a lucky guy.
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
- No, thanks, Carl. - Monsieur Rick...
Captain Renault, may I--?
Not here. Come to my office in the morning.
We'll do everything businesslike.
- We'll be there at 6.
- I'll be there at 10. I'm very happy for both of you.
Still, it's very strange that you won.
Well, maybe not so strange.
- I'll see you in the morning. - Thank you, Captain Renault. No!
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.
Go away, you crazy Russian.
- As I suspected.
You're a rank sentimentalist.
- Yeah? Why?
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Well, I'll forgive you this time.
But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blond.
And it'll make me very happy if she loses.
- Mr. Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you.
- Go ahead. Well, isn't there some other place?
It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
- In my office. - Right.
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca.
It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement.
You know what I've been doing.
You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands of people that I reach America and continue my work.
I'm not interested in politics.
The problems of the world are not in my department.
I'm a saloonkeeper.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record.
You ran guns to Ethiopia.
- You fought against the fascists in Spain.
- What of it?
Isn't it strange you're always fighting on the side of the underdog?
Yes, I found that a very expensive hobby.
But then I never was much of a businessman.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?
- I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
- 200,000. My friend, you could make it a million francs or three.
My answer would still be the same.
There must be some reason why you won't let me.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, ask your wife. - My wife?
- Yes.
Play "La Marseillaise." Play it!
See what I mean?
If Laszlo's presence in a café can inspire this demonstration what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on?
I advise that this place be shut up at once.
- But everybody's having a good time.
- Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
- But I have no excuse to close it. - Find one.
Everybody is to leave immediately.
This café is closed until further notice.
Clear the room at once.
How can you close me up?
I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here.
- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you. Everybody out at once.
After this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
This morning you implied it wasn't safe to leave Casablanca.
That is also true, except for one destination:
occupied France. - Occupied France?
- Under safe conduct from me.
Of what value is that?
You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
- There are two other alternatives for him.
- What are they?
The French authorities may find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
The other alternative?
My dear, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca human life is cheap.
Good night, mademoiselle.
- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.
Our faithful friend is still there.
Please don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
I must.
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets to display heroics before his wife.
Don't joke.
After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I'm frightened.
Tell you the truth, I'm frightened too.
Shall I remain here in a hotel room, hiding?
Or shall I carry on the best I can?
Whatever I'd say, you would carry on.
Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick?
What did you find out?
- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?
But no intention of selling them.
You'd think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
Did he give any reason?
- He suggested I ask you.
- Ask me?
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."
I don't know why he said that.
Well, our friend outside will think we've retired by now.
I'll be going in a few minutes. - Ilsa, I...
- Yes?
When I was in the concentration camp were you lonely in Paris?
Yes, Victor, I was.
I know how it is to be lonely.
Is there anything you wish to tell me?
No, Victor, there isn't.
I love you very much, my dear.
Yes, I know.
Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I...?
You don't even have to say it.
I'll believe.
Good night, dear. Good night.
- Victor. - Yes, dear?
Be careful.
Of course I'll be careful.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Two weeks, maybe three.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before.
In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
Thank you, Herr Rick.
Sascha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl?
- Then I am going to the meeting-- - Don't tell me where you're going. I won't.
Good night.
Good night, Mr. Rick.
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is ahead of schedule.
Well, won't you sit down?
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.
Your visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit?
Seems as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
Ask any price you want, but you must give me the letters.
I went all through that with your husband. It's no deal.
I know how you feel about me but put your feelings aside for something more important.
I have to hear again what a great man your husband is what an important cause he's fighting for?
It was your cause too.
In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
I'm not fighting for anything anymore except myself.
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
We loved each other once.
If those days meant anything at all to you--
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
It's poor salesmanship.
Listen to me.
If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth--
I wouldn't believe you no matter what you said.
You'd say anything now to get what you want.
You want to feel sorry for yourself, don't you?
With so much at stake all you can think of is your feelings.
One woman has hurt you, and you take your revenge on the rest of the world.
You're a coward and a weakling.
No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.
If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
What of it?
I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
Now, if you'll-- All right.
I tried to reason with you.
I tried everything. Now, I want those letters. - Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.
Put them on the table.
No.
For the last time, put them on the table.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything.
All right, I'll make it easier for you.
Go ahead and shoot. You'll be doing me a favor.
Richard I tried to stay away.
I thought I would never see you again.
That you were out of my life.
The day you left Paris if you knew what I went through.
If you knew how much I loved you.
How much I still love you.
And then?
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.
They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him.
Just a two-line item in the paper:
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.
Then it came. He was dead.
Shot trying to escape. I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.
Then I met you.
Why weren't you honest with me?
Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.
Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage.
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with us.
And when did you first find out he was alive?
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together.
A friend came and told me that Victor was alive.
They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris.
He was sick. He needed me.
I wanted to tell you, but I didn't dare.
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you.
Well well, you know the rest.
Well, it's still a story without an ending.
What about now?
Now?
I don't know.
I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
And Laszlo?
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out. Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.
All except one. He won't have you.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once.
Oh, I don't know what's right any longer.
You have to think for both of us.
For all of us. All right.
I will.
Here's looking at you, kid.
I wish I didn't love you so much.
- I think we lost them.
- Yes. - I'm afraid they caught some of the others.
- Come inside.
Come, Mr. Laszlo, I will help you immediately.
Carl, what happened?
The police break up our meeting, Herr Rick.
We escaped at the last moment.
- Come up here a minute. - Yes, I come.
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.
- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.
Yes, I come. I will do it.
- I want you to take Miss Lund home. - Yes, sir.
It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window. This might come in handy. Thank you.
- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this?
I mean, what you're fighting for.
We might as well question why we breathe.
If we stop breathing, we'll die.
If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
What of it? Then it'll be out of its misery.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine?
Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart.
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.
- I get the point. - I wonder if you do.
I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect.
I know that you're in love with a woman.
It's perhaps a strange circumstance that we both should be in love with the same woman.
The first evening I came into this café I knew there was something between you and Ilsa.
Since no one is to blame I demand no explanation.
I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit.
All right. But I want my wife to be safe.
I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
You love her that much?
Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause.
Well, I am also a human being.
Yes, I love her that much.
- Monsieur Laszlo?
- Yes? You'll come with us. We have a warrant for your arrest.
On what charge?
Captain Renault will discuss that with you later.
It seems that destiny has taken a hand.
You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.
All you can do is fine him and give him 30 days.
You might as well let him go now.
I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo.
If you were to help him escape--
What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Because, one, you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.
And you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks.
As a matter of fact, I don't either.
They're all excellent reasons.
Don't count too much on my friendship.
In this matter I'm powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective.
I get the point. Yes, I have the letters. But I intend using them myself.
I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane.
The last plane.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.
That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape.
The last man I want to see in America.
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.
You can fill in your name and hers and leave anytime you please.
Why are you still interested in what happens to Laszlo?
I'm not. But I am interested in what happens to Ilsa and me.
We have a legal right to go, that's true but people have been held in Casablanca in spite of their legal rights.
- What makes you think we want to hold you?
- Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know.
Louis, I'll make a deal with you.
Instead of this petty charge against him, you could get something big something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years...
- Be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it? - Certainly.
Germany-- Vichy would be very grateful.
Then release him.
You be at my place a half-hour before the plane leaves.
I'll have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters and that'll give you grounds to make the arrest.
You get him, and we get away.
To the Germans, that last will be just a minor annoyance.
There's still something about this I don't quite understand.
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes but you were never interested in any woman.
- She isn't just any woman. - I see.
How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
I'll make the arrangements now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
I'm gonna miss you.
You're the only one in Casablanca who has less scruples than I.
Oh, thanks.
Go ahead, Ricky.
Call off your watchdogs when you let him go.
I don't want them around this afternoon.
I'm taking no chances, Louis, not even with you.
Should we draw up papers, or is a handshake good enough?
Certainly not good enough.
But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do. To get out of Casablanca and go to America...
You're a lucky man.
My agreement with Sam is that he gets 25 percent of the profits.
That still goes. I happen to know he gets 10 percent.
But he's worth 25. Abdul, Carl and Sascha, they stay with the place or I don't sell.
Of course. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Well, so long.
Don't forget you owe Rick's 100 cartons of American cigarettes.
I shall remember to pay it to myself.
- You're late.
- I was informed when Laszlo left the hotel so I knew I'd be on time.
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed here.
This place will never be the same without you.
I know what you mean.
But I've spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
- Is everything ready?
- I have the letters right here.
When we searched the place, where were they?
Sam's piano.
Serves me right for not being musical.
Here they are. You better wait in my office.
Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.
Haven't you told him?
- Not yet.
- But you were able to arrange everything?
Everything is quite all right.
We'll tell him at the airport.
The less time to think, the easier. Please trust me.
Yes, I will.
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We've still lots of things to do. - I brought the money.
- Keep it, you'll need it in America.
- But we made a deal. - Never mind that.
- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?
- No. It's all arranged.
Good. I've got the letters here, made out in blank.
All you have to do is fill in the signatures.
Victor Laszlo.
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.
The charge of accessory to the murder of the couriers from whom the letters were stolen.
You're surprised about my friend Ricky?
The explanation is simple. Love, it seems, has triumphed over virtue.
Not so fast, Louis.
Nobody is going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
- Have you lost your mind? - I have. Sit down.
- Put that gun down.
- I don't want to shoot you but I will if you take one more step.
Under the circumstances, I will sit down.
- Keep your hands on the table.
- I wonder if you realize what this means.
I do. We've got time to discuss that later.
Call off your watchdogs, you said.
Just the same, call the airport and let me hear you tell them.
And remember, this gun is pointed right at your heart.
That is my least vulnerable spot.
Hello? Is that the airport?
This is Captain Renault speaking.
There'll be two letters of transit for the Lisbon plane.
There's to be no trouble about them. Good.
Hello?
My car, quickly! This is Major Strasser.
Have a squad of police meet me at the airport at once.
At once, do you hear?
Hello, radio tower?
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes, east runway.
Visibility, 1 1/2 miles.
Light ground fog. Depth of fog approximately 500.
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.
Have your man go with Laszlo and take care of his luggage.
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.
- Find Laszlo's luggage. Put it on the plane.
- Yes, sir. This way, please.
If you don't mind, fill in the names. That'll make it more official.
You think of everything, don't you?
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.
I don't understand.
What about you? I'm staying with him till the plane gets away.
No. What has happened?
Last night you said--
Last night we said a great many things.
You said I was to do the thinking for us.
I've done a lot of it since then. It adds up to one thing:
You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
Now, you've got to listen to me.
Any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here?
Chances are we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. True, Louis?
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.
Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor.
You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going.
If that plane leaves and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
But what about us?
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have-
- We'd lost it until you came to Casablanca.
We got it back last night.
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will. But I've got a job to do too.
Where I'm going, you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of.
Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble.
But it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.
Someday you'll understand that.
Now, now.
Here's looking at you, kid.
- Everything is in order. - All except one thing.
There's something you should know.
I don't ask you to explain anything.
I'm going to anyway. It may make a difference to you later on.
You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
You didn't know she was at my place last night when you were.
She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
Yes.
She tried everything to get them. Nothing worked.
She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me. But that was all over long ago.
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
I understand.
- Here it is. - Thanks.
Welcome back to the fight.
This time I know our side will win.
Are you ready, Ilsa?
Yes, I'm ready.
Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
You better hurry. You'll miss that plane.
I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
What you just did for Laszlo.
That fairy tale you invented to send Ilsa away with him.
I know a little about women, my friend.
She went. But she knew you were lying.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us.
Especially for you. - I'll have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
- What was the meaning of that phone call?
- Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?
Ask Monsieur Rick.
- Get away from that phone. - I advise you not to interfere.
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
- Hello! - Put that phone down.
- Get me the radio tower. - Put it down!
Major Strasser has been shot.
Round up the usual suspects.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
I think perhaps you're right.
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while.
There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville.
- I could be induced to arrange a passage.
- My letter of transit? I could use a trip.
But it doesn't change our bet. You still owe me 10,000 francs.
That 10,000 francs should pay our expenses.
"Our" expenses?
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
And may this be the fate of all the witches, warlocks, and sorcerers... who attempt to work their evil magic within the township limits of Roxford.
The book of exorcism, please.
Mayest thou and thy kind be condemned forever to eternal flames... never to return to the neighborhood of Roxford.
And now, while we prepare for the extinction of the father of this witch... the old sorcerer who attempted to come to her aid... there will be a short intermission.
Popped maize.
Get your fresh Indian popped maize, tuppence a poke.
It's buttered, it's hot, it's fresh.
An anti-witch charm in every poke.
Tuppence, please.
Popped maize. Here we are.
It's buttered, it's fresh.
Popped maize, Master Wooley?
What has got into thee, Jonathan?
- What?
- Dost doubt she was a witch?
I should never have accused her if I were not sure.
And her father.
Unquestionably a sorcerer.
Mother, if thou hadst seen what I saw.
We both saw our cows turn pink, then blue and our sheep dancing a minuet.
- But thou didst not see Jennifer.
- Jennifer?
She told me her name when she chased me into the hayloft.
She was young and beautifully fair fairer than all women that ever were.
How didst not tell that to the judges?
Because I could never describe her beauty.
What happened in the hayloft, Jonathan?
She brought her golden tresses close to my face and whispered...
"Jonathan Wooley, thou hast denounced me as a witch.
For that thou shalt be accursed.
Thou and thy children and thy children's children... all will be under the same curse."
What was the curse?
"I and all my descendants will be unhappy in love.
The marriages we make will be disastrous until..."
Yes?
- 'Tis too wicked to tell thee, Mother.
- Rubbish!
Thou art in love with Purity Sykes and even betrothed to her.
- Aye, Mother.
- And Purity is a woman among thousands.
Aye, Mother, she is that.
Jonathan, wouldst leave thy future wife sit there all alone?
- What ails him, Mistress Wooley?
- Ah, Purity.
- You will find he is a dreamer.
- He needs only a firm hand.
Jonathan, I must ask thee to be more attentive.
- In the future...
- Look!
The oak tree. 'Twill be planted over their ashes.
- Why?
- To hold the evil spirits... shh!
... prisoner in its roots... thus keeping their wicked powers from surviving.
I hope.
And this is the tree which was planted over their ashes.
The witches' spirits, of course... are imprisoned in its roots.
Imprisoned forever.
Martha...
I have the honor to...
- to...
- Are you proposing to me?
Yes, Martha.
Oh, Nathaniel!
What was that?
Fort Sumter fired upon!
War declared between the states!
Nancy... Nancy, control yourself.
Control yourself.
Drop your hand.
I wish to throw this vase!
Master Wooley, did you hear?
War! - Where is the nearest recruiting' office?
- Running off to war like a coward!
I'm not talking about the whole house at the moment.
It's that living room!
Estelle!
Now... Now, listen to me!
Estelle!
Estelle.
Estelle, please.
- What?
- Miss Masterson?
Please.
Hold it.
One more.
Papa, I'm leaving.
Smile.
Will you try to be more pleasant?
At least until after the wedding.
Fellow members of the Roxford Country Club...
Dr. White's proposing another toast.
I realize that lovebirds... would like to be out on the veranda whispering sweet nothings.
After a certain ceremony tomorrow... they will have all the rest of their lives for billing and cooing.
Mostly billing.
But if the voters have any sense at all, they will insist... that the first four years of the honeymoon be spent in the governor's mansion!
Go ahead.
You might pick up a few more votes.
- We want Wooley!
- We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
I see getting married... as well as trying to get elected, calls for speeches.
I can truly say... that a new life is beginning for me.
All right! Ladies and gentlemen, it's just a storm.
Ladies and gentlemen... while at the moment, the future seems a little dark...
Well, you see?
One never knows what the next moment will bring.
Where am I?
What's happened?
A miracle!
An infernal miracle!
We're free again.
Free at last!
- Who speaketh?
- 'Tis I, thy father, Daniel.
But thou hast no substance.
Nor hast thou, Jennifer.
We are smoke... witches' smoke.
But our evil spirits have survived.
'Twill be sweet to plague the human race again.
First we'll visit the cornfield and ruin the crop.
'Tis always a good way to limber up.
Look, Father.
The cornfield is no longer there.
Well, we must expect a few changes in 270 years.
- Were our spirits in the wood that long?
- Aye. I counted the tree rings.
See?
They've built a new house.
- It seems all ablaze.
Is it on fire?
- Not yet!
What's knittin', kitten?
You like to cut a rug?
Let's ditch these ickies.
How about goin' to heaven in your jalopy?
That's solid, Jackson.
Now you're cookin' on the front burner.
What language is that, Father?
I don't know, but we'll learn it.
See how they dance today.
They stand so close.
Well, well, well.
Things have changed.
I never thought I'd see clothes like that in New England.
These cannot be the descendants of the Puritans we knew.
There's something that hasn't changed in 270 years.
Keep thy mind on our business!
'Twould be nice to have lips... lips to whisper lies... lips to kiss a man and make him suffer.
Father, why cannot I have lips and eyes and hair?
Careful.
Someone's coming.
Quick!
Do as I do!
These bottles... we'll hide in them.
Quick! Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!
Whee!
Are you all right, Jennifer?
'Tis full of bubbles in here.
They tickle!
My bottle has the tang of maple rum!
Look, Father!
Come closer, man, so I can see thee better.
Riddle-dee-dee, riddle-dee-doe... get thee hence and stub thy toe.
There was something familiar about that face.
- What'll it be, Mr. Wooley?
- The same... bourbon.
Yes, sir, Mr. Wooley.
Wooley!
I knew I recognized those features.
Well, well, well.
A descendant of the man who had us burned.
No wonder he looks so unhappy.
I put a curse upon his family.
Well, I thought lovebirds always flew around in pairs.
Estelle's talking politics.
- What's the matter?
Election jitters?
- No. How can I lose, with Masterson and all his papers in back of me?
My future father-in-law has never backed a loser.
You know that. If he spoils his record this time, I'll have to hock my stethoscope. I know that.
You're betting on a sure thing, Dudley.
He isn't missing a trick.
Look at that.
Posters at a private party.
The whole marriage is just another campaign stunt to him... insisting we hold it the day before the election... so I'll get a good publicity break on election day.
Wallace, I think you've had enough to drink.
- Now, Estelle...
- I'd like to go home.
- Yes, dear.
Can we drop you, Dudley?
- Yes, thanks.
The curse is working.
She has the look of a shrew!
Here, Tom.
Jennifer, what's that curse thou wast chattering about?
Each Wooley must marry the wrong woman.
Ha!
What a curse!
Every man who marries, marries the wrong woman.
True suffering cometh, when a man is in love with the woman he cannot marry.
Father, suppose a man were in love with a witch.
- With me.
I would not marry him.
- Ha! Ooh, pardon me.
I need air.
# For tonight I'll merry, merry be #
# Tomorrow I'll be sober # Let's get out of here.
Let's go for a little ride.
Broom!
- Father, give me a body.
- Oh, no.
Thou didst get into enough trouble with thy last one.
Thou canst not give me a body.
Thou wouldst not even know how to begin.
No?
I'd merely make a little fire.
As thy last body was destroyed by flame thy new one would be born in flame!
Prove it.
Start that great house on fire.
A hotel for pilgrims.
'Twould be a pleasure burning that.
All right, I will.
Worra, worra, fizzle, dizzle... let the flame begin to sizzle!
P-I-L-G-R-I-M...
H-O-T-E-L!
Good-bye, Father.
Good-bye, Jennifer.
Be a bad girl.
- That's the Pilgrim Hotel!
- It would have to be on our way home.
We'll have to stop.
You wouldn't go through fire for your future wife?
Boy, look at those flames.
I never saw such a fire.
- Is there any way we can get through?
- Sorry, Mr. Wooley.
It's all blocked off.
- Some firebug must've touched this off.
- He did a good job!
This is the craziest fire I've ever seen!
Laps up water like a cat!
- You're sure everybody got out, alright?
- Yes, sir. We've checked every room.
Yeah, they're all accounted for.
It's all right, men.
Everybody's safe.
Get these people back.
We're stuck here for a while.
Tell them who you are.
They'll have to make way.
- I'm sorry, Estelle.
- Wallace, where are you going?
There's Mr. Wooley!
- Make way for Wooley.
- Make way for the next governor.
- Would you like to go through?
- Yes, thank you.
Folks, let him get by.
- I'm voting for you.
- There goes a great guy.
- Hello, Mr. Wooley.
- Hello.
Don't get too close.
I got a bet riding on you.
- How did it happen?
- Nobody seems to know.
There was an explosion on the roof.
The top floor went like that.
Then the fifth, then the fourth.
Now it's on the third.
Soon it'll be on the second, and then the first... then it'll all cave in on the basement.
- What's so funny?
- Oh, it's fully insured... and I love building new things.
I want to build it in a classic gothic design.
- Don't you love gothic? Huh?
- Quiet.
What was that?
Did you hear that voice?
Somebody's inside.
Listen!
I didn't hear anything.
It was so clear!
A woman's voice.
Aw, there's nobody in there.
They've looked everywhere.
No, wait.
Wait.
There it is again!
Here I am, Mr. Wooley.
- Over here.
- Where?
I...
I can't see!
Just walk.
You'll find me.
Keep walking.
This way.
This way.
- Are you all right?
- I think so.
Two legs, two arms, a face, hair.
- Yes, I seem to be complete.
- Why don't you come out?
I've been waiting for you, Mr. Wooley.
- Where are you?
- You're getting warmer.
Here's my hand.
How can I get you out?
I can't see a thing.
I can see you.
How do you do?
Never mind.
Let's get out of here!
- Just a moment, h ave you a gazing glass?
- A what? A mirror.
I want to see what I look like.
- At a time like this?
- Oh, I'm cold.
- Cold?
In this furnace?
- But I have no clothes.
No clothes?
Here, put this on.
How did you get here?
From the top floor.
Why do you look away?
Am I not pretty?
Who cares?
Come on.
Get up, get up!
I can't!
Here, I'll carry you.
Legs are funny when you're not used to them, aren't they?
- Huh?
- Why are you in such a hurry?
Why?
The whole building was on the third floor, and now it's fallen to the second.
When this ceiling gives way, we'll be buried alive.
Nothing will happen to us.
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, I do.
Ah!
Here's a door!
Here!
This way's blocked.
The bars on the window.
Quick...
- Where are you?
- I've found a better coat.
And a mirror!
Mm, not bad.
Oh, I'm a blond.
Would you rather I be a brunette?
If you don't get out of this fire, you'll be a redhead!
Don't you realize...
That was the second floor.
Well, there's no way out.
We're goners, little girl.
Perhaps I should be little.
I'm just as high as your heart.
Did you hear what I said?
We're trapped.
Just we two.
Look, before I got here... what... what hit you on the head?
I felt nothing until your hand touched mine.
Oh, I see.
Well, it was nice meeting you.
Oh, would you like to leave now?
It would be a pleasure... but that door is now a wall.
Oh.
Then we can use the one behind the screen.
- Quick!
It's our only chance!
- I want to fix my hair.
Come on, while you still have a head!
Do you like blonds?
May I get a picture?
Hold it right there.
He saved somebody!
All right, stand back, people.
- Are you all right?
- I guess so.
- You certainly gave me a scare.
- Wally...
- take me away from these people.
- Here, Dudley.
She's suffering from shock.
Well, uh guess I'd better take you to a hospital.
Oh, well, I hope she's all right.
It's only natural for you to be concerned.
Estelle, I've told you a dozen times.
There's no point in...
Well? It's amazing.
Not a scratch on her.
Not a burn.
- You must be relieved.
- You've known me all my life.
She never met Wally.
The girl's suffering from delusions.
You see?
She has delusions.
- Well, I haven't!
- Estelle, you must believe me!
- Listen to me.
- I've never seen her before... and I...
I'll never see her again!
- Dear, you ought...
- It's silly to drive me home and then back here.
- You need rest.
- Darling...
I know best.
You have to get used to pleasing me sometimes.
- All right, dear.
- Ooh, you still smell of smoke.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.
Susie, you know you can't come in until breakfast time.
Scat!
Scat!
Susie!
Susie!
Susie?
Susie, where are you?
Hello, darling.
- I thought you'd never get rid of that girl.
- What are you doing here?
Waiting for you.
- But the hospital, the...
- I didn't like it there.
How did you get here?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
What am I to do with you?
Just look on me as an old friend of the family.
- But I never laid eyes on you before.
- Come here, Wally.
Am I not an attractive female?
- What's that got to do with your being here?
- Am I?
Yes, yes, you're very pretty.
- Take my hand again.
- Now, come.
I know you've had a terrible experience.
And now a pleasant one.
You... have a very nice hand.
And now it can shake mine good night.
- Your hand is cold.
- Well, so is yours.
Yes, good-good night.
Let mine rest in yours a moment.
See?
It's growing warmer.
Well, that's fine.
That's fi...
- Amusing-looking chap, isn't he?
- Yes.
- Ancestor of mine.
- I'm aware he is.
Jonathan Wooley.
He would have been more hospitable.
Oh, I don't think so.
Well, I have a busy day tomorrow.
It's time for beddy-bye.
- Mm, take my hand again.
- You're becoming a problem.
- Am I?
- Yes, and that is not the solution.
See, it isn't respectable for you to be sitting in a stranger's house.
- I like your resisting me.
- Oh, you do?
- You know what I'm going to do with you now?
- Yes.
Just, uh, get up, please.
- Where are you taking me, Wally?
- We're going out.
Night, Jonathan!
I'm going to give you money, and you can go back wherever you came from.
- No, not yet.
- Yes, right now!
Ooh, this is a lovely sensation.
Even nicer than flying.
- What's going on, Governor?
- Not "Governor" yet, Fred.
She was in a fire and lost her clothes.
No, I didn't.
I didn't have any.
- Evening, Mr. Wooley.
- Have you any money, Joe?
- About eight bucks.
- Well, I only have ten, but here.
Give it all to her and take her anyplace she wants to go.
I'll pay you tomorrow.
For heaven's sake, be good.
What'll I do with the coat?
When you're through with it, send it to the police.
It...
It didn't belong to her.
I hope that cab is heated.
Where to, lady?
Where to?
- Oh.
- Hope I didn't butt in on a pleasant dream.
Just wanted to make sure you're all right.
- You've certainly earned a drink.
- I'll say I have.
Upstairs you go.
Get a good night's sleep.
I'll take this.
- Dudley, she was here!
- Who was here?
The girl I saved in the fire. That's impossible.
When I left her in the hospital, she was sleeping like an angel.
Well, that's some hospital.
She got away.
And some angel.
Now, wait a minute, hmm?
Tell me this again slowly.
No, tomorrow.
I've had enough for one day.
Well, how about me?
I've got $10,000 tied up in this election.
If this gets out, you're a dead goose.
Think of the scandal... the night before your wedding.
Nothing. That's it... the election!
That girl was sent here by the opposition.
- They're trying to frame me.
- You're right.
Rainfogle and that bunch wouldn't stop at anything. Did anybody see her?
- Nobody who'll do any talking.
I'll put her down as an amnesia case.
Give the police a description.
Was she wearing that fur coat?
Maybe you'd better not say anything to the police.
- Everything's all right now.
I got rid of her.
- Well, try and forget her, then.
You want a pill to make you sleep?
No. No, thanks.
I'm much calmer now.
- Oh, make sure the door locks.
- Okay.
Relax, now.
Good night, Wally.
Now close this door, Wally.
I said close this door, Wally.
Now come here.
I'm coming.
My pajamas.
I don't want to call the police, but I know your whole scheme.
- You do?
- And I know who's behind it all.
- You don't.
- Want me to mention names?
- What names?
- County Chairman Martin J. Rainfogle.
- That's a nice name.
- Want another?
- Mm-hmm.
- State Senator Conrad O'Hara Jr.
Sheriff Peter L. Glasshauser and all his ward heelers.
- How much are they paying you?
- Nothing.
Hmm?
- You're just doing it for love, hmm?
- Yes.
Father thought it'd be a good idea.
- Who is your father?
- You've never met him.
But he doesn't want this state to have a good administration.
Father doesn't want any state to have a good administration.
- But he's out to get me particularly.
I am a pretty good judge of character... and I don't think you're really a bad girl.
- Don't you?
- You're very young.
I'm older than you'd guess.
I don't think you ought to go back to that father.
I'd rather stay with you.
You would?
You really would, wouldn't you?
Now I understand.
Just because I was of some slight help in getting you out of that blazing inferno... perhaps you are, momentarily, infatuated with me.
But it isn't love.
And I'm not in love with you.
I guess this'll take longer than I planned.
I'm afraid you have rather a romantic mind.
You see, love isn't just a matter of... two people meeting under romantic circumstances.
Love... that is, love that is really worthwhile grows slowly.
Real love is...
like a painting.
Ah, yes.
Yes, there have been thousands and thousands of couples just like us... going their separate ways, never realizing the other was waiting somewhere.
Why, Romeo and Juliet knew right away.
That's what Shakespeare's trying to tell us.
Of course, the case of Dante and Beatrice is a trifle different.
He saw her only once.
But in that moment, the whole world was bathed in a new light.
It wasn't just a humdrum world anymore, where you had to... get up in the morning and meet a lot of stupid people.
Who's that?
- 8:00, Mr. Wooley.
- What?
- 8:00.
- That's impossible.
But... it's true!
- Good morning, Wally.
- Good morning, Jennifer.
It's fantastic.
It just seems like a few minutes since I came in.
Don't you want your breakfast?
You're as bad as when you were a little boy.
Even on a day like this, I have to call you half a dozen times.
Oh, and what a... what a beautiful day it is too.
Happy is the bride that the sun... shines on.
Good morning.
Mmm!
That smells good!
You don't know how long it's been since I've eaten.
- Mr. Wooley...
- I'll explain later, Margaret.
- What can you possibly say?
- Well, you...
No, no, dear.
Not like that.
First you butter them, hmm?
And then a little syrup.
Mr. Wooley, I've worked for your family for 30 years... been almost a mother to you... and to think that on this day, of all days...
Oh, yes, and send up some evening gowns too, please.
You see, everything the young lady had was burned.
Send them up right away, please. Thank you.
You know, I think you've broken my record for waffles.
Well, Margaret likes nothing better than to make them.
Those people are still downstairs waiting.
Margaret, these have made a great hit with her.
- What did you say?
- Those people.
I told you they were here three batches of waffles ago.
You did?
I don't remember.
Uh, people waiting? Who?
Who are they?
- You'll find out.
- Excuse me.
Mm, more waffles?
There's no more batter.
Oh!
I'm sorry, Margaret.
- Better be sorry for yourself.
- Huh?
It's Miss Masterson downstairs, with her father.
Who?
Miss Masterson, the lady you're getting married to.
Oh!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I'd forgotten you were going to drop in.
We didn't say we were.
What's the matter with you?
Have you seen the papers?
I've got you all over the front page. That's great.
Dear, hadn't you better go?
- It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
- Don't be ridiculous.
Saving that girl was the luckiest break.
You don't know what that can do for you.
I have a rough idea.
I've arranged a special broadcast about the fire.
You're to be interviewed.
- I'll have you back by 11:00.
- That's fine.
That gives me plenty of time.
Shall we go?
No, I'm going to stay here.
I want to see about brightening up this antique shop.
- The photographers will be here.
- There's no time for that.
- Run along.
- I'm a little on edge, with the wedding at noon.
I'd feel much better if you came along. There.
That's a good girl.
Excuse me.
I'll get my hat.
- How did that happen?
- It just slammed shut.
I'm terribly sorry.
There's rather a heavy draft... blowing through the house today.
What's he going out with her for?
Why shouldn't he?
He's going to marry her in less than two hours.
- As for you, young woman...
- Oh, go to sleep.
After all my work!
No, I don't want to go.
Two hours.
That doesn't give me much time.
I wish Father were here.
What seems to be the trouble?
Oh, good morning, Father.
I need some advice.
He's tougher than I thought.
- I can't seem to make him love me.
- Thou art the veriest bungler.
I must have been drunk to give thee a body.
Oh, don't smoke so much, Father.
- Did something go wrong with thy philter?
- My what?
Thy love philter.
Thou gavest him one, I presume.
No.
I thought I could do it barehanded.
Art thou a witch or a woman?
Prepare a love philter at once.
Dost thou recall the incantation?
Listen.
# Kettle, kettle on the hob #
# Hurry up and do thy job #
# Steam and hiss and while you do #
# Cook an all-compelling brew #
# So that he who sips will be #
# Slave to love's captivity #
Now put in a cool place until ready.
- What will it taste like, Father?
- Like cool water...
- but 'twill set Master Wooley's blood on fire.
- Then I'll treat him like a slave.
I'll make him suffer, body and soul.
Speaking of bodies, I have a notion to make a personal appearance myself.
Of course, I'll have to burn a house down to do it.
Not this one, Father.
I've a better idea: the building he's in now.
- 'Twill force him back to me.
- Excellent!
Good hunting, Jennifer.
'Tis growing cool.
Now we shall see if thou canst resist me.
Get ready, Master Wooley.
- Not dressed yet?
- I'm lucky to be alive.
What's happened now?
I was making a broadcast about the fire, and suddenly I was in another one.
- Mysterious explosion on the roof.
- Anybody hurt?
No, we all got out all right.
What's wrong with this door?
Margaret!
What are you two doing in my bedroom?
What happened?
Oh, I... I must have dozed off.
Go upstairs and get dressed.
Where's the brandy?
- Did you get rid of that girl?
- "That girl"?
Oh!
She must still be here.
Well, she won't be here for long.
Ah, you listen to me, young lady.
Come on, come on.
Get up.
I'm listening, Mr. Wooley.
Why do you look at me that way?
Oh... my dress.
Do you like it?
I... I don't know.
It's such a shock to see you dressed.
I mean...
- you're beautiful.
- Enough to make a man fall in love?
- Mere physical beauty isn't everything.
- That's what I thought.
- Now, look, Jennifer...
- I don't like the tone of your voice.
I swallowed some smoke last night, and I just swallowed more now.
- But that's not going to stop me...
- Wally wants a drink of water.
Nice, cool water.
- Thank you.
Now, all I have to say...
- Drink it, Wally... and then I'll be glad to hear anything you have to say.
You'll find out that no one named Wooley is able to stay away from me.
Oh, I'm awfully sorry.
This is terrible.
Jennifer! Jennifer!
Can you hear me?
Dudley!
Come here!
Oh, you... Here, here.
Drink this.
There.
There, that's better.
Now, how do you feel?
I... I feel strange.
- Hmm?
- What happened?
Well, the picture fell.
Does your head hurt?
- My head?
- Mm.
No.
It's my heart.
- It feels so light.
- Try not to talk.
Oh, but I must.
I must tell you how I feel.
Oh, Wally, you're so beautiful.
Dudley!
- Take my hand.
- Don't start that again.
Oh, my darling.
Let that man alone!
Dudley, something really happened to her this time.
- She got a sock on the head.
That picture...
- You did it in self-defense.
Aren't you glad you drank it, Wally?
- I didn't drink anything.
- What's she talking about?
A drink of water.
I gave it to her when she was coming to.
You gave it to me?
You should never force liquids on a person who's unconscious.
It may have serious consequences.
Nervous reactions.
- Come on.
We're late.
- What are we going to do?
- Lock her in this room.
- But, Dudley...
Come on, before she marries you.
Stop worrying.
She can't get out.
I'll drive.
You're too nervous.
You'll have to get rid of her after the wedding.
Poor little girl.
All alone in the world except for a no-good father.
Don't ever jam your brakes on like that!
I didn't jam them.
It just stopped.
- I can't figure it out.
- What's that smoke?
- What happened to him?
- Who?
The fellow we pulled out of the fire.
He's gone!
How do you like my body, Jennifer?
Not too old, not too young.
I'm sorry I've forgotten the formula for clothing.
I had to borrow this sheet from the ambulance.
By the by, has the potion been administered?
Yes.
Father, something went wrong with our plan.
- What?
But that love philter never fails.
- It didn't. But...
I drank it.
Nicodemus!
Then you love him!
Yes, Father.
But he's about to marry someone else because of my ancient curse on the Wooleys.
Do you think if I explained it all to him...
By all means do.
Telling a mortal you're a witch will only mean the end of you.
Then what shall I do?
He must not marry her.
You won't let him, will you?
- Let me think.
- You could make him love me.
You can do anything you want.
Yes.
This problem should be fairly simple.
- Just leave it all to me.
- Oh, thank you, Father!
- Will you leave it to me?
- I promise.
Splendid.
I'm still a little bit warm from the fire.
Jennifer, fetch me a pair of Master Wooley's breeches.
We're going to his wedding.
# I love you truly #
# Truly #
# Dear #
# Life with its sorrows #
# Life with #
# Its tears #
Here, drink this. - What is it?
- Novocain. 120 proof.
- Down fast, brother.
- If that girl ever gets out of my house...
Drink that. Suppose she comes here?
It'll be terrible for Estelle.
Oh, you'll be all right, and I'll be sitting pretty.
- ## [Instrumental Interlude]
- There's your cue.
Just play "I'm a seeing-eye dog" now.
- Can't you smile?
- You know I wanted a church wedding.
You've had everything else your own way.
The reception and... I should never have given in to Wallace.
It's the last time.
She's not here.
Stop worrying.
Smile.
Close that door!
It's a hurricane!
- My veil is ruined!
- Go back and wait.
I'm terribly sorry.
There'll be a short delay till we get everything straightened out.
Music, music!
Sing something.
# I love you truly #
That's all I needed:
a hurricane on my wedding day.
Never mind about that.
She just blew in!
- What?
- I saw her in the doorway.
- What'll I do?
- I'll think of something.
Beloved, this is my father.
Delighted, Master Wooley.
You've made a mistake.
This is a private room.
It's rather crowded downstairs, and a bit windy.
Be seated, Master Wooley.
I should like to have a talk with you.
Look here.
I'm being married in two minutes.
- I understand those were your plans.
- "Were?" He is.
Nothing you can do...
- Would you excuse us?
- Maybe you'd better.
Hurry up.
I'll stand guard.
Let me fix your pretty tie.
You see, Father?
He's just like a Greek god.
My little one tells me she was your overnight guest.
- Not at my invitation.
- Oh, no, Father.
The poor sweet didn't want me to stay.
Were I an ordinary man, Master Wooley... a horsewhipping would no doubt be in order.
But I am not an ordinary man.
While examining your dwelling...
- I came upon... this.
- My revolver!
You can't force me to marry her.
What a banal mind you have.
You may hold the weapon.
- What is this?
- It's very simple.
Here is a bruised flower.
I am her father.
That is your revolver.
You are going to shoot me.
I... am going to shoot you?
Will that be of help?
Now, now.
Father knows best.
Warm, Master Wooley?
You don't know what warmth is.
I am told one of your forebears made a hobby of bonfires.
What a pity he cannot be here... to see his descendant burn.
Yes, Master Wooley.
Burn.
In the modern way.
Strapped in a chair heated by electricity.
I anticipated that.
Pistol, pistol, let there be... murder in the first degree.
Thank you so much.
Amusing invention, the electric chair.
What will they think of... next?
- What's happened?
- Uh...
- It was an accident!
- 'Twas no accident.
He killed me in cold blood.
Kindly notify the authorities.
Oh, he's frightened you.
He told me he'd help me.
- How is he?
- He's dead.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
"Doesn't matter"?
Her own father!
Oh, but that's not my father.
That's just a body he picked up.
I didn't do it, Dudley!
You'll be my witness!
All right.
Well, I wasn't here!
He's as nervous as a bride.
One might think they were going to hang him.
It's up to you.
Now, tell them.
What have I got to do with it?
You're handling the... details of the wedding.
# I love you truly #
# Truly #
Empty!
I thought I saw smoke come out.
I know you're here somewhere.
How could you, Father?
You know I love him!
That's exactly why I've disposed of him.
Where are you?
# For tonight I'll merry, merry be For tonight I'll merry, merry be #
# For tonight I'll merry, merry be #
# Tomorrow I'll be sober #
Come out of that bottle.
- Come out!
- Oh, no.
I could float here forever.
Well, you're not going to.
Wally!
Don't go upstairs!
- But maybe she killed herself.
- Now, Wally... Wally...
- What's wrong with him?
- I think we'd better call the police.
- What's he done?
- It's the other fellow.
- What other fellow?
- The one in the chair.
Keep calm.
I'll be right back.
Estelle!
Estelle!
# Ah, love, 'tis something #
# To feel #
Now, you get back in that body.
No. I didn't like it.
It's an old, fat body.
Then I'll tell Wally what we are.
Knowing what would then happen to you?
- Yes.
- Heh.
You wouldn't dare.
Wouldn't I?
You're all right?
Wally, darling, there's something I must tell you.
Look!
- I thought you said he was dead!
- Well, he is!
A fine way to take advantage of a father's affection.
Now hearken to a father's curse.
I'm going to turn you into a frog.
Frog, frog, sitting on a log...
What's the next line?
You wait till I sober up.
You'll be sorry.
# For tonight I'll merry, merry be For tonight I'll merry, merry be #
# Tomorrow I'll be sober #
- What did you want the police for?
- It's all right now. He fell out the window.
- He what?
- Not Wally.
The other fellow.
- Unhand me, foul minions of the law!
- Take it easy, Pop.
I'm going to cast a spell upon you.
From now on, you're a rat!
Rat, rat, fatter than the cat...
- How does the rest of it go?
- So I'm a rat, huh?
- Call the wagon.
- Come on.
If I could only remember the words, I could turn you into kangaroos.
They're taking him away.
Why didn't I have them take you too?
Perhaps because you're beginning to love me.
- Please don't start that again.
- Wally!
I thought Father would be friendly.
I wouldn't let him or anyone else harm you.
- Oh, I know you wouldn't.
- But it's true!
Last night I was your enemy, but now I've changed.
I love you.
I'll always love you.
- If I could die, I would do that for you.
- Will you just be a sweet girl?
- Hey, they're ready.
- Good-bye.
- Where are you going?
- I told you before...
But I thought that now, after all I've done for you...
You've been very obliging, but now I'm going downstairs to be married.
That's what you think.
Ahhh! Wally!
You gotta go through with it this time.
I'll take care of her.
## ["Bridal March"] - Hurry up, hurry up.
Let's get this over with.
- He'll pay for this.
- Do I look all right?
- Who cares?
Go on.
Well, what are you standing there for?
Dudley has the ring.
I'll see what's keeping him.
- Wallace.
- You come back here!
What's the matter with you?
Did you ever have one of those days when nothing seems to go right?
Wallace!
# I love you truly #
- Got here too late.
- Dudley.
She really did love me.
She said she'd die for me.
- Oh, my darling.
- At last!
I've had enough of this!
Estelle, wait a minute!
Listen to me!
You've got to listen to me!
Uh... It's a big misunderstanding.
If you'll give me a few minutes, I...
I'll give you just ten seconds to get out of this house, all of you!
We won't be here that long.
- You'd better get out of the state.
- I'm terribly...
- Get out!
- I can explain everything.
Uh, after the fire, you see, she spent the ni-night...
On-On second thought...
- maybe we'd better just go, darling.
- Mr. Masterson...
I'll expose you in every paper I own!
This'll not only cost you the election, but I'll encourage the voters of this state to tear you limb from limb!
I'll head the tar-and-feather party personally!
When I'm through with you, you'll wish you'd never been born.
# I love you truly #
- Will you shut up?
- # Tru... #
Extra! Big Wooley scandal!
Read all about it!
Extra! Paper!
Big Wooley scandal!
Extra! Read all about it!
Wallace Wooley exposed!
Extra!
Paper!
- Big Wooley scandal!
- What does it say?
It's just as I thought.
He's finished.
And I'm bankrupt.
Go and get her, I say.
Bring my daughter to me.
Bring her here or, by Jezebel...
- Shut up!
- Quiet!
- I wanna get some sleep!
- Hey, toss this stub bug out of here!
For the last time, will you pipe down?
I tell you, my daughter ran off with a bumpkin... named Wooley, Wallace Wooley.
Sure, she did. You take it easy.
You'll be out of here tomorrow.
Tomorrow may be too late!
There's no telling what she'll do.
I know a couple of ways to make you shut up.
And I know a hundred ways... to silence you forever.
Oh, but I don't remember them now.
This is terrible!
She'll marry him.
Wallace Wooley's gonna marry his daughter.
Yeah?
And then you'll see what'll happen to Master Wooley.
I'll wreak my vengeance on them both.
She thinks she can run away from me... that I cannot see her because of the fog.
But I can see you, Jennifer.
She smiles.
She presses closer to him.
Darling?
Yes, Wally?
You're guessing about those mileposts, aren't you?
No, I can see them.
I have rather unusual eyes.
If we're really over the state line, I can relax.
Wally, what color would those feathers be?
"Feathers"?
Oh, I don't know.
But the tar would be black.
Let's stop, Wally.
I guess we'll have to.
I can't even see the front of the car.
Mighty nice scenery they have around here.
- Lovely, isn't it?
- We'd better walk to the next town.
No, I thought we'd stay here.
Here?
We're in the middle of nowhere.
How do you know, Mr. Wooley?
Good evening.
If you're looking for a place to stay, I have a lovely room.
Thank you.
- Do you have two rooms?
- No, I'm sorry.
Aren't you married?
You're dressed for a wedding.
Where's the nearest justice of the peace?
He'll be down in a minute.
Henry?
Customers.
Uh, let's see.
One dollar for waking up the county clerk and helping you get your license.
Two dollars for the ceremony.
One-fifty for lodgings.
Rent of my pajamas, 25 cents.
Rent of nightgown...
I'll have to charge you 50 cents for that.
- It's sort of an heirloom.
- Yeah.
There.
Almost a perfect fit.
My grandmother was just a little bit of a thing like you.
Oh, shall I light the fire?
Oh, no.
I'd like to try.
I must start learning to be a good housewife.
Let's see.
You... just go like that, don't you?
Of course.
They're like any other matches.
Well, good night, my dear.
I'm sure you're going to be very happy.
He's a fine young man... and I hope your boys take after him.
And I hope your girls take after you.
By Rhadamanthus, on, fire!
- Wally?
- Yes, dear?
- Did you see the way that fire came on?
- What fire?
All I can see in this room is you.
- Darling?
- Mm-hmm?
- Do you want to have children?
- Why, of course.
I'd like three little girls exactly like you.
- Ohh!
- Huh?
I think I'd better tell you.
You'd never forgive me if you found out later.
- Aha!
A confession!
- Yes, Wally.
I haven't exactly been a saint myself.
We'll compare notes in the morning.
No, I must tell you now.
I don't know how to begin.
Then don't.
- Wally?
- Hmm?
Doesn't it seem strange to you, the way we met?
It's all been like a dream.
- It was witchcraft.
- That's it.
Of course.
- You see, Wally...
- Shh, dear.
It's getting late.
But I want you to know what I am.
All right.
All right, what are you?
I'm a witch.
A witch?
I knew it all the time.
- You did?
- Of course.
I've been under your spell since the moment I met you.
Then... it doesn't matter?
You don't mind being married to a witch?
I love it.
I'll try so hard to be a good wife, and I'll only use witchcraft to help you.
What could you do, for instance?
I could make you win the election tomorrow.
Oh, it would take witchcraft to do that.
- I think I can manage it.
- Fine, fine.
After all, I'm not just an ordinary witch.
My family dates back to the days of Pompeii.
- Were you mixed up in that?
- My father was.
Ever hear of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire?
That was our crowd.
You're marvelous.
Seriously, dear... do you like to sleep on the left or the right?
You don't believe me.
Wally, try to understand.
270 years ago...
That's too long a story, dear.
Can't it keep till tomorrow?
Wally, 270 years ago...
- You're not listening to me.
- Yes, dear.
Yes, I am.
270 years ago...
I'll tell you tomorrow.
Let me out!
Let me out!
Oh, why can't I remember... the formula for dissolving iron?
- Let me out!
- Quiet!
- Pipe down!
- I couldn't get any shut-eye all night.
- Ah, throw him into solitary!
- Yeah.
That's Wallace Wooley.
Don't tell me they're tossing him in the clink.
It looks that way.
Pay up, brother.
They ain't electing no con for governor.
Bensinger's a cinch.
Why couldn't you keep straight until after you was elected, like everybody else does?
I'd like to talk to you about Jennifer.
We were married last night.
Yes, I know.
Congratulations, Master Wooley.
Thank you.
She's been saying the oddest things... last night and again this morning.
What?
Silly things... about living in Roxford 270 years ago, and, uh... and being a witch.
Beelzebub!
Don't you think I know?
Oh, then she's acted that way before?
Well, maybe I can help her.
Silence!
I must concentrate.
Iron, iron, melt away...
Oh!
I can't remember a thing.
What is the matter with me?
I'm afraid you've got a hangover.
Don't tell me what I've got!
I invented the hangover!
It was in 1892 BC.
Did you believe her?
That's the important thing.
"Believe her"?
Why, the things she said didn't make any sense.
Then there's still hope.
At first I thought she was joking, but she keeps talking about the election... saying she'll make me win by witchcraft... and that that'll prove she's a witch.
Master Wooley, see if you can get me out of here.
I know how to handle her.
Thanks.
I'll do my best... but I'm afraid I haven't much influence in this town anymore.
- It'll be a Bensinger landslide!
- Quiet!
Three cheers for Wallace Wooley!
Hurray!
Hurray!
Hurray!
- We want Wooley!
- We want Wooley!
- We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
- Quiet!
We want Wooley!
Hey, hey.
I thought you wanted Bensinger.
- I changed my mind.
- Yeah, but you're bettin' on Bensinger.
All right, so I'll lose.
- We want Wooley!
- We want Wooley!
Quiet!
Quiet!
We want Wooley!
Wallace Wooley is a fraud!
An impostor!
A hypocritical demagogue!
That's why I'm asking you to vote for...
Wallace Wooley.
- Mr. Masterson...
- One moment, please.
Yes?
You said, "Vote for Wooley."
Did I?
Correction, ladies and gentlemen.
The man I am backing is Bensinger.
W-O-O-L-E-Y!
We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
We want Wooley.
- We want Wooley!
- We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
That includes every precinct in Kearsarge County, folks.
It looks as if the whole state's gonna make it a Wooley landslide.
More in a minute.
- I can't believe it.
- That's just what she'd said she'd do.
- There's no other explanation.
- You mean she's a...
You see why I couldn't go down to campaign headquarters tonight?
- If this gets out...
- Let's look at these Wappasocket figures.
They're not complete.
You can't be carrying Wappasocket County.
That's Bensinger's home.
Another bulletin, folks:
Complete returns from Wappasocket... show the entire county has climbed on the Wooley bandwagon.
- Well?
Are you convinced?
- He must mean another county.
Hold everything.
Here's a flash, folks.
At 10:45 tonight, with only three precincts yet to be heard from... election returns were as follows:
Wallace Wooley... 2,684,922.
Elwood Bensinger... none.
He didn't even vote for himself.
Dudley, I've married a witch.
What am I going to do?
Let me look at you.
Did you say she's 800,000 years old?
No, no, no, no, no.
That's her father.
She's only 290.
- I see.
- But you'd never think it.
Well, marriage does a lot for people.
Well, Wally, this clears everything up.
All except one little point:
How did she get out of the hospital that night?
- She used a broom.
- Oh, of course!
I must be getting stupid.
A child would know that.
Dudley, what... what am I going to do?
- How many people have you told?
- No one but you.
How can I tell anybody?
I see your point.
People are so skeptical.
Might be hard to grasp that the first lady is a witch.
- I don't care about them.
What about me?
- Look out!
Are you satisfied, darling?
You're the new governor.
- What are you going to do now?
- Help you with your slippers.
- No, not just yet.
- Then I'll warm them by the fire.
You know, I lighted it with a match, Wally.
From now on, I'm going to be just a simple, helpful wife.
Dudley, I can't take it. "A helpful wife." What if she runs me for president?
We want Wooley!
What's that?
People gathering in the street.
They want you to make a speech.
- Real people?
- Naturally.
They all voted for Wally.
- What am I gonna say to them?
- I don't know.
There are one or two things I wouldn't tell them.
Good night.
- Where are you going?
- I've gotta be getting home... into my straightjacket!
- Would you like me to drive you?
- No, thanks.
I'll call a broom...
I mean, a taxi.
- Wally, darling.
- Yes, dear?
You don't mind my being a witch, do you?
Well, you'll admit it's a little unusual.
- No one need ever know.
- We'll talk about that later, dear.
It'll be our little secret.
Our little secret?
Now go out and make your speech to them, dear.
Good evening, my dear.
Three cheers for Wallace Wooley!
Hurray!
I must compliment you on the public confidence... you have inspired for Master Wooley.
- You're not going to hurt him again?
- I will attend to him later.
I am concerned now with an erring daughter.
I've done nothing except love him.
You have informed him that you are a witch.
Need I remind you of the punishment that I must perforce administer?
At midnight, back to the tree!
There to stay until the present race of men is extinguished.
A rather light sentence, considering the offense.
But if I don't wish to go...
- There is nothing you can do about it.
- I'm still a witch.
No, my dear.
Your heart is so full of human love... that I can no longer trust you.
Until you have resumed a more spirit-like existence... you shall be a mere mortal!
I've remembered all the spells you've taught me.
Out, fire, by Rhadamanthus!
Out!
You see?
Your power is dead.
Mine remains.
Out, fire.
Better get ready.
Soonest done, soonest mended... and midnight approaches.
May I... say good-bye?
Certainly, my dear.
I'll be around.
...endeavor to give this fair state an honest administration.
As a former governor so aptly put it...
Wally!
Wally!
Uh, and in conclusion, thank you very much.
What is it?
- You must help me!
- You want me to help you?
- Come on, darling.
Hurry!
- No, no.
But where?
Anywhere.
Out the back door.
Hurry up.
Anyplace, Joe.
Just drive around.
Hey!
That's my cab!
- What is all this?
- I had to get you away.
Something might have happened to you.
- What?
- I don't know, but something awful.
- Can't you tell me about it now?
- Wally, I'm afraid!
You are afraid.
What trouble can you be in that you can't get out of by witchcraft?
- I've lost my power.
- What?
I'm not a witch any longer.
I'm like any other girl.
I wish we could go so fast that no power on earth could overtake us!
- Faster!
- Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around.
You are like any other girl... afraid of lightning.
That isn't ordinary lightning.
- Can't he go any faster?
- Step on it, Joe.
Faster.
Nobody could possibly catch us.
Joe's a wonderful driver.
There's nothing he can't do with the car.
They've certainly improved this road.
Is it midnight yet?
No.
Five minutes to 12:00.
Don't look!
Back to the tree!
Don't worry about me, Master Wooley.
I am accustomed to fire.
Come, Jennifer.
I have decided to return with thee to the tree.
I am weary of mortals.
There's no use fighting.
It has to be like this.
- Jennifer, what are you saying?
- Go, Wally.
Midnight.
Good-bye, my darling.
I want you to remember me as I was:
just an ordinary girl.
He'll remember.
That will be his torture.
And I'll remember that I loved you.
Through all eternity I'll remember.
Thou wilt remember nothing of this tender feeling.
That will be the essence of thy punishment.
I'll never forget.
With all my strength I'll fight.
Love is stronger than witchcraft.
I'll remember everything... the sound of your voice... your worried looks... the warmth of your arms around me... the touch of your lips.
Good-bye, Wally.
Good-bye, my darling.
I'll remember.
I'll always remember.
Always.
Always.
Always.
Look at him.
Is it not good to see him suffer?
Yes, Father.
Is this not a perfect revenge on the Wooleys?
Yes, Father.
Could we follow him?
And why?
To watch him suffer, of course.
Well said, Jennifer!
Thou art a witch again!
She's dead, Master Wooley.
Thy marriage is a mournful memory.
Let's be gone, Jennifer.
Let me tarry but a moment at this window.
I wish to see it all.
Thou art enjoying it, eh?
Oh, yes.
And thou?
I cannot remember when I've had a better time.
It's great in here.
I've called a doctor, Mr. Wooley.
Jennifer?
The sound of his voice... it no longer thrills thee?
- No, Father.
- Good.
And his worried looks?
And the warmth of his arms around thee?
These are things that have no meaning for me now.
And the touch of his lips?
Wally... love is stronger than witchcraft.
# For tonight I'll merry, merry be #
# For tonight I'll merry, merry be #
- # Tomorrow I'll be sober #
- Oh, no, you won't.
Wally, darling, all our troubles are over.
At least for the present.
Mr. Wooley...
I've been with your family for 37 years, but this is the end.
- What is it, Margaret?
- I simply cannot handle your daughter!
Jennifer!
I told you never to play with that broom.
Why?
I'm afraid we're going to have trouble with her someday.
Oh, that's impossible.
I hope.
# Good night, ladies #
# We're going to leave you now #
- In case we miss the train, we have the place in Yonkers. - Of course.
- What'd he say?
- He said "Of course."
- We're from Texas originally. - Of course.
- What'd he say?
- He said "Of course."
- Why does he keep sayin' the same thing all the time?
- My husband's a little deaf.
- Of course. Yes. - What'd he say?
He said it's as quiet as a tomb here – just what we're lookin' for.
- I don't mind a little life. We'll be dead soon enough. - Come in.
Concrete.
- I said, "Come in." - I'm fine, thanks. How are you?
I hope all the tenants aren't as disagreeable.
I can assure you they're not. The building is very friendly, efficient and quiet.
♪♪ She got in by mistake, but she's leaving in the morning.
- What?
- I said she's leaving first thing in the morning.
Who? My wife?
You going home to see your mother?
What's that?
Canary?
I love birds.
I said she is leaving the first thing in the morning.
You don't have to shout. And your best friend oughta tell you a little secret.
Just speak in a low, clear voice.
I said she's leaving first thing in the morning. She got in by mistake.
But tomorrow she flies away.
I understand it's a bird.
What about it?
It's right here.
- Duplex. - What's the ceiling so high up for?
That's what duplex means. The one floor up over the –
- You don't keep the apartment very clean. - What's on the balcony?
You see, the former tenants aren't getting the service.
A little delinquency in the rent.
What's he say?
I don't like him to talk to me.
He says the former tenants haven't been getting any service.
That's why the place is so dirty. They didn't pay the rent.
I don't mind a little dirt.
That's the trouble with women – always fussing' around, lookin' for something to pick on.
- You can tell me later, Arthur. - Never satisfied with things the way the Lord made 'em.
Why, dirt's as natural in this world as sin, disease... storms, twisters, floods and cyclones.
Is there anything else you'd like to try?
What you doin' in the bathtub with your wrapper on?
I might ask you what you're doing in my bathroom.
I don't suppose you go with the flat.
- Nah. That's too much to hope for. - Thank you.
- I'm glad you like my perfume too.
I said I'm glad you like my perfume too.
You have a lovely, clear voice – like a bell.
If I was married to you, I'd hear everything you said almost... but you wouldn't enjoy it.
- Besides, I'm already married. - So am I.
Me too.
Anyway, I'd be too old for ya.
"Cold are the hands of time that creep along relentlessly... destroying slowly but without pity that which yesterday was young.
Alone, our memories resist this disintegration... and grow more lovely with the passing years."
Heh. That's hard to say with false teeth.
You're a funny old man.
I didn't get it, but you looked very pretty when you said it.
- I love birds. - You do?
If they're showing the apartment and you're still in it, you must be broke, huh?
- Ah, it doesn't matter. - What did you say?
Uh, yes.
- That varmint renting' it out from under ya?
- Yes. I know how you feel.
I was broke, too, when I was about your age.
But I didn't have a figure like you got. I had to use my brains.
You'll get over it. You'll get over being young too.
Someday you'll wake up and find everything behind ya. Gives ya quite a turn.
Makes ya sorry for a few of the things ya didn't do while ya still could.
- Are you sorry?
- How much rent do you owe?
Well, that isn't really your business.
I can't hear you. You're mumbling.
I said it isn't really your business.
I'm in the sausage business. Don't worry about me.
This'll be a hot one on the wife.
She's down there poking her snoot in everybody's business... egged on by that varmint.
How much do you need?
- Don't be silly. - Will 500 cover it?
Please don't talk nonsense.
I can't hear you. You're mumbling again.
You shouldn't mumble with such a lovely voice.
I wouldn't do this for everybody.
- This joke has gone far enough. - You say that ain't enough?
Well, how much do you need?
Y-You're just embarrassing me.
That's all right. Don't mention it.
It's a privilege to do a favor for such a beautiful lady.
It makes me feel young again.
- There. - Oh. How do you suppose it makes me feel?
I haven't seen anything like this for so long.
You talkin' about the money?
Forget it. I'm cheesy with money.
I'm the Wienie King – invented the Texas Wienie.
Lay off of 'em. You'll live longer. Here.
Buy yourself a new dress, too, and a new hat.
You're a fine girl. So long.
Whoopee! Hot diggity!
Hello? Give me Longacre 5-6599, please.
You see, it's strong and safe. It's simple and practical.
It lets the light and air through, and it's practically invisible from below.
And it's built right in the middle of the city... instead of way out in the sticks somewhere.
Excuse me a moment. Be right back.
- Yes? - Darling, the most exciting thing has happened.
Look, honey, I'm right in the middle of a talk with a very important gentleman.
- Could you tell me later?
- Oh, all right, dear.
Of course, this is the big one... but to build a working model in some field or village somewhere... that small planes could actually land on – to prove that it was practical – would only cost about $99,000.
After that, we'd be on velvet.
You see, it's a steel mesh made of stretched cables.
Every municipality, every town, every city needs one.
- My patent is basic. - $99,000 is a lot of money.
Oh, but it isn't what it costs. It's what it brings you back.
I've got $99,000 now... but if I was to build this thing, I might –
Let's start all over again from the beginning.
Go ahead. My time ain't worth anything. I'm retired.
Hey, Mike, come here a minute.
Take a gander inside and see if the manager's gone to dinner.
- I don't wanna see him face-to-face.
- Sure.
But if it's the rent you're thinking about... you can go in and whistle up his nose – it's paid.
- It's paid?
What do you mean it's paid?
- It's paid.
- Who paid it?
- Your wife.
- My wife?
- Well, I'm sure it wasn't mine.
- An old man give her the money. - What do you mean an old man gave her the money?
I said I'm taking you to dinner and then the theater and then supper.
So hurry up and put on your dinner jacket.
Just a minute.
What's all this malarkey about some old man paying the rent for you... that the whole building is buzzing with?
It's not malarkey, darling. Here's the receipted bill. You see?
It says "Paid." And I paid the butcher and the grocer and the drugstore.
And I got this dress and had my hair done... and six pairs of stockings and some new shoes.
And here's $14 in change. That's for you.
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Sensational. But you haven't quite answered my question yet.
- What question, dear?
- Why this alleged old man gave you – How much is it?
- $700. - $700.
- Why?
- No reason.
- Oh, is that so? He just – $700, just like that?
- Just like that.
Sex didn't even enter into it?
Oh, but of course it did, darling.
I don't think he'd have given it to me if I had hair like excelsior... and little short legs like an alligator.
- Sex always has something to do with it, dear.
- I see.
From the time you're about so big... and wondering why your girlfriends' fathers are getting so arch all of a sudden.
Nothing wrong. Just an overture to the opera that's coming.
- I see. - You don't really.
But from then on, you get it from cops, taxi drivers... bellboys, delicatessen dealers.
- Got what?
- The look. You know.
"How's about this evening, babe?"
- So this gent gave you the look. - The Wienie King?
Oh, no.
Oh, at his age, darling, it was really more of a blink.
Really?
This is very illuminating.
You don't have to get rigid about it.
It was perfectly innocent, I assure you.
Where'd you meet this Wienie King?
- You'll die laughing when you hear. - All right. Convulse me.
- In the bathtub. - In the bathtub?
- Yes. Isn't that charming?
- Delicious. What were you doing in the bathtub?
- I was hiding from him. - Hiding?
What kind of games do you play around here while I'm out?
- I wish you could've seen the expression on his face. - I'm glad I didn't.
- How much water was there in the tub?
- I was standing in the bathtub.
- You were standing in the bathtub?
- In my pink wrapper.
Oh, darling, he was just a funny little old man in a funny hat.
- We sat on the edge of the bed and talked for a while. - He's on the bed now, is he?
There aren't any chairs in the bedroom, darling.
What was he doing in the bedroom?
He wanted to rent the apartment.
But when he found out we were broke, he gave me $700 and he left.
- Just like that?
- Well, I did kiss him good-bye.
- Now the truth is coming out.
- The – Oh. "The truth."
You just tell me where this Wienie King lives... and I'll take his money back to him and tell him what I think of him.
I don't know where he lives, darling.
I don't even know his name, and I don't think they'd give the money back –
I mean the grocer and the drugstore and all.
- You really couldn't blame them after they waited so long. - That's right.
Rub it in.
- Tom?
- Yes?
It's wonderful to have the rent paid, isn't it, and the bills settled up?
You feel free and clean, and I like that feeling. I wish it were always like that.
Don't you think I do?
I'd almost forgotten what it was like.
I don't look forward to being in debt again, slinking past everybody.
- I dread it. - It isn't gonna be for always.
Everybody's a flop until he's a success.
Something's bound to come through. I got too many good ideas.
Say, there's a $2.00 overcharge here.
Now that everything's paid up, you could move.
Well, where'd we go?
I wasn't thinking about me. I just meant you.
Oh. You mean the bust-up?
Mm-hmm. When'd you get that idea?
This afternoon?
I've had it for some time, but something always said, "Wait till he crashes through.
Wait till he's made one success."
You'll never make a success with me around.
- I'm just a milestone around your neck. - Millstone.
I'm no good for you, darling.
I don't mean I'm not good for somebody... but I can't cook or sew or whip up a little dress... out of last year's window curtains.
What difference does that make?
I'm like a car that only gives seven miles to the tankful.
Only you haven't got the tankful.
Are you sure you haven't got a tankful?
You see, by yourself, you could live so simply. Just a little room anywhere.
Or maybe move in with your brother or even use the couch in your office.
And you wouldn't keep slipping back all the time.
You could balance what you earned and look the world in the eye... maybe even get ahead a little.
- Thanks. And what would you be doing?
- Oh, that's no problem.
You can always find a good provider if you really want one.
He may not look like a movie star, but –
- We'll get ahead someday. - But I don't want it someday.
I want it now while I can still enjoy it.
Anyway, men don't get smarter as they grow older. They just lose their hair.
- Gerry – - But I would!
I'm very tired of being broke, darling... and feeling so helpless about having my hands tied.
I could've helped you so many times.
But every time I tried to, you tried to punch the man in the nose.
Don't talk rot.
- How about that president of the smelting company?
- That wolf. Well, he's still the president of a smelting company.
We might've been in the smelting business now and paying our rent.
- Lovely. - He liked you very much, he said.
The less I hear about that hyena, the better I like it.
But that's what's so irritating – to know that I could get you someplace without doing any harm either.
You have no idea what a long-legged gal can do without doing anything.
And instead of that, I have to watch you stamping around proudly... like Sitting Bull in a new blanket... breathing through your nose while we both starve to death.
- Thanks. - You don't have to keep saying thanks all the time.
- I'm not being nice. - That's the first time I've said it.
If you want a divorce, you're certainly entitled to it.
I don't know where the money's coming from.
The next husband always pays for that.
- You have him all picked out, have you?
- Oh, you're such a child!
He doesn't happen to be in the sausage business, by any chance, does he?
I may not even get married again. I might become an adventuress.
I can just see you starting for China on a 26-foot sailboat.
You're thinking of an adventurer, dear.
An adventuress never goes on anything under 300 feet with a crew of 80.
You just let me catch you on a 300-foot yacht or even a 200-foot yacht.
At least I wouldn't have to worry about the rent.
Oh, I'm sorry. Let's go and have some dinner, hmm?
How can you think of food at a moment like this?
Because I'm a woman, maybe, and a little more practical than you.
Are you going to put on your dinner jacket, or shall I take off my new dress?
Mmm. Is that a new dress?
- You'll always be a sister to me?
- I know it sounds stupid, but I'm a rotten wife.
- I can't sew. I can't cook. - You certainly can't.
Just because I'm a useless wife doesn't mean I couldn't be very valuable to you as a sister.
But very valuable.
I remember that pot roast you tried.
And all the boys who wanted to go out with me...
- would naturally have to be in your good graces. - Naturally.
- Or I wouldn't go out with them. - I'll say you wouldn't.
- They'd probably offer you partnerships. - In the smelting business.
In the smelt – No.
You could have your choice.
I don't begin and end with a smelter, you know.
I refuse to understand what you're talking about, Geraldine.
They'd work you in on deals... and let you in on all the good things happening in the market and that kind of business.
Monkey business.
Very few pretty girls' brothers have ever failed, you know... if they knew enough to come in out of a hailstorm.
In the first place, I don't happen to be your brother.
In the second place, who are all these men who are gonna faint at your feet?
- You think there aren't any?
- I didn't say there weren't any. I just said, "Where are they?"
They're around. They're always there.
And they make new ones every year.
- I don't wanna be rude, but I – - You're not being rude, dear. You're just being yourself.
You're married to me. That's like saying you're blind to me.
For a long time, I've been a part of you... just something to snuggle up to and keep you warm at night, like a blanket.
But you can't see me any more than you can see the back of your neck.
I've put on new dresses. I changed my hair.
Would you mind not looking quite so gorgeous while you say all these things?
- You're just plastered. - Yes.
Well, better get you home before you fall apart.
Or do you object to spending the night under the same roof with me?
I wasn't thinking about the roof.
Come on.
Just a minute. I gotta pay the check.
I'll sleep on the thing here.
Well, you know we don't love each other anymore. We're just habits – bad habits.
Uh – They don't make these zippers as well as they used to.
And when love's gone, there's nothing left but admiration and respect.
I think it's stuck. Will you see if you can get it?
Come around here in the light.
Keep still, will you?
You don't think this is a little intimate, do you?
Oh, go.
Doesn't mean anything to you anymore to sit on my lap, hmm?
No.
Or if I... kiss you there?
Stop it. No.
Or here.
It's nothing.
- Or here. - You know I'm ticklish.
- Then why is your breath coming faster?
- Because you're squeezing me.
That doesn't mean anything to you anymore, huh?
Almost nothing.
Almost nothing – nothing but a habit, a bad habit.
It is, huh?
Very, very bad and wicked... and stupid and useless... and young and impractical and –
- Yow! - Oh! Oh, darling!
- What's the big idea?
- Darling, read this note.
- Huh? - Good-bye.
God bless you. Take care of yourself.
- Will you wait a minute?
- No, I won't. I've made up my mind.
It's best for both of us, while we're still young enough to make other connections.
But you're forgetting a little thing called love. I love you, and you love me.
That's all that matters. That's all you can take with you. Everything else is –
I'm so sorry. Please accept all my apologies.
Gerry!
Hey, Officer!
Hold that woman! She stole my suitcase!
Why, you lying –
You mean this one?
That's right. I'll be right down.
Do I look like a suitcase stealer to you?
It isn't how you look. It's how you behave that counts in this world.
- Now, I mind the time, and –
- Oh, wise guy.
Thanks for holding her, Officer.
You wanna prepare charges or something disagreeable like that?
No, I'd prefer not to. This is my wife, Mrs. Jeffers. Mr. Mulligan.
The name happens to be O'Donnell, if it's all the same to you... and I have a good mind to charge you with false arrest... only I don't know if I could make it stick.
- Why don't you try? - Oh, it's too nice a mornin'. To heck with it.
Why don't you two learn to get along together? I had to.
- Now what?
- Now, will you come back upstairs and be sensible?
No, I won't. Give me back my suitcase.
It was hard enough to make up my mind to do what I know is right.
If I don't do it now, I'll never be strong enough again. Now give me my suitcase.
Stop talking like a fool, Gerry.
Where are you going – to visit your sister in Long Island?
Taxi! No. I'm going to get a divorce.
How can you get a divorce without money?
How can you go anyplace?
Why don't you be sensible?
You've just got a hangover.
I don't need any money. I've already told you.
Taxi!
- Yes, ma'am? - Where's the best place to get a divorce?
Gerry, for heaven's sake.
Most people go to Reno, but for my money, it's Palm Beach.
This time of year, you got the track, you got the ocean, you got palm trees.
- Three months. You leave from Penn Station. - Look.
I'm in awful trouble. - I haven't got a dime. Would you take me there for nothing?
- To where?
Palm Beach?
- No, no. Just to the station. - Oh, sure.
Hop in, babe. - Thanks. - Listen, you!
- Listen what?
- Give me my suitcase!
Give the lady her suitcase.
- Listen, you! - Oh! Now, look what you've done!
- Look what I've done?
- Yeah. Look what you've done.
Hey! - What's the trouble now?
- Taxi!
Pick this stuff up, will you?
Hey, you have to –
Gerry!
Gerry, stop behaving like a chicken with its head cut off.
You haven't got any money. Where can you go?
- I got this far, didn't I?
- But, Gerry –
- Where's my suitcase?
- But listen, honey –
Good-bye.
- Gerry, listen to me. You're making a fool out of yourself. - This man is trying to molest me.
- Will you stop him?
- Where you goin' in such a hurry, laddie?
Let the dames alone at Pennsylvania Station...
Pennsylvania Station will leave you alone and vice versa.
- That's my wife, you dumb cluck! - So now I'm a dumb cluck, am I?
I like peace, but I ain't morbid about it.
Stop annoying these dames, or I'll lock you up!

Why not?

I have a feeling that everything's going to be all right.
Aye!
- Did it come yet?
- No, but it's all right.
- What do you mean it's all right?
- It's far from all right.
- We have a wonderful idea. - The other members and myself, having talked it over –
- We have a private car. - We have tons of tickets.
- I could never accept. - We're just goin' to Savannah to shoot quail.
- But if you wanna go any further, we'd gladly –
- You can be our mascot.

- All right? It's perfect.
Oh, then thank you for your chivalry, gentlemen.
- I accept with pleasure. - The pleasure is ours.

- Oh, I –
- No ticket, no passee.
All aboard!
Gerry! Gerry!
- Hiya! Come on in! - Oh, hello!
Glad you could come. - Here. - Not while we're on duty, thanks.
Who's the head man here? - You mean president of the club?
- Whoever has the tickets. We don't care.
Oh, Ozzie! Front and center!
- This is Mr. Osmond, president of the Ale and Quail Club. - How are you?
It's about the tickets. How many in the party?
- How many members in this club?
- Well, there's –
There's, uh – There's Ozzie and Hitchie and him and him.
That makes four. And you and me. That makes six.
- I'm not a member of this club. - And why not?
- It isn't good enough for you?
- Now let's get this straight. How many members are there?
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Six. All right. That's three.
Now we'll start from there. You tryin' to make a liar out of me?
Mr. President, I move that this member be expelled!
- Second the motion. - All those in favor, say "aye"!
Aye!
- All right. We're expelled. - Have a drink, boys.
- Okay. That's four. - That's seven!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. What's the matter with you?
You cockeyed?
- It ain't me that's cockeyed. - Lookin' for trouble, eh?
Mr. Osmond doesn't always carry his liquor to perfection.
- Now let's start this all over. - Now just a moment, Officer.
I'm not an officer. I'm a conductor on this train.
Uh, all in "flavor," say "aye"!
Aye!
- Opposed?
- Nay!
- Opposition vote.
- Good night. - Good night.
- If there's the slightest trouble, just knock on my wall. - Oh, thank you, Mr. –
Don't give it a thought. As I've so often said at dinners and our little gatherings and –
- Where's your baggage?
- My bag – What?
Where's your luggage?
What are you going to sleep in?
Oh, that's quite all right. I'll just – You see, I left so hurriedly.
Why, bless my soul, you stay right here.
I'll have you a pair of pajamas before you can say – What size do you take?
Never mind. You'll have to take my size. They may be big, but still –

Any calls?
Where's that pretty girl with the nice figure that lives here... that I seen yesterday?
- Who are you?
- I'm fine, thanks. How are you?
You must be her husband. Where is she?
- What's that your business?
- I'm in the sausage business.
Just wanted to tell her we moved in after all.
Took the green apartment down the hall that the opera singer moved out of.
She's gone.
I say she's gone! She's gone to Florida! She's going to divorce me!
- You say she's gone?
- That's right.
Good for her. A pretty girl like that can get anybody.
Why hang around with a man that can't pay the rent?
Look here, you've made trouble enough around here without getting insulting about it!
Don't threaten me! I'm twice your age and only half as big...
- but I'm mighty handy with a shillelagh – - All right, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I guess you didn't mean any harm!
You're probably very kind at that.
- You say she's gone and left you?
- That's right.
- How did she go? By train?
- That's right.
That's right!
Why don't you fly down there in an aerioplane with a bunch of roses in your hand... and meet her when she gets off and bring her home?
- Because I'm not in the sausage business! - So am I.
And it's a good business if you know where to get the meat cheap.
That's my secret, and I ain't telling' no one.
- Have you got money for an aerioplane ticket?
- No!
Why don't you say so instead of standing' there like a big stinkweed!
How much do you need?
Open the door!
- What'd you say?
- Open the door!
- We want you to hear something. - Oh, but I've gone to bed.
- That's all right. - Get back in bed. We'll put you to sleep.

- No, ma'am. - What do you mean my clothes aren't there?
They're in stateroom "B," in the private car behind the diner – the club car –
- with my ticket, my handbag, my lipstick and everything. - No, ma'am.
- "No, ma'am." You just didn't look. - Oh, yes, ma'am, I looked.
But I didn't see it 'cause it weren't there. That's why I didn't see it.
- I suppose it just blew up. - No, ma'am. We set it out.
- You set it out?
The conductor kinda got riled up with 'em... so he set it out on a siding at Rockingham Hamlet for 'em to cool off.
- A very pretty little city. - Never mind the geography. Where's the conductor?
- He got off at Rawley. That's where he lives. - Last call for breakfast.
- Dining car in the rear. - Very pretty countryside there.
- You don't seem to understand. My clothes are lost. - Last call for breakfast.
- Shut up. - Yes, ma'am.
No, ma'am. They ain't lost. Nothin' ever gets lost on a Pullman.
They safe, all right. I recollect one time a lady left a whole pile –
- I just want to get into my clothes. - You can't do that.
- What do I go around in – a blanket like an Indian?
- I got a brown overcoat.
- Well, that's very kind of you. - Hello.
- Hello. - What are you doing for breakfast?
Well, if you don't ask me, I won't be doing much.
And if you do ask me, it might make quite a scandal.
- Huh? - Lady lose her clothes.
You lost your clothes?
Why, that's terrible.
And my ticket and my bag and my shoes and my makeup.
My toothbrush – only I don't think I had one.
This is disgraceful. I'll certainly write to the president of the company.
- How could such a thing happen?
- I don't know.
My things seem to have gotten into a car back there somewhere somehow... and now the car just doesn't seem to be there.
Not that car full of drunks, I hope, that they had to disconnect.
Oh, perish the thought.
As soon as we come to a town, I could jump over to a store and jump back.
With a Mother Hubbard. Well, that's very kind of you.
In the meantime, I suppose I'll have to lie here in this hat rack.
Anyway, I haven't any money for you to jump over to a store and back with.
- Oh, I have money. - Oh, you have?
Oh, yes. Now, if you could just get over to the store to pick out what you need –
We got a stretcher in the baggage car up ahead.
Wouldn't that be stretching it a little?
Wait a minute.
Maybe we could borrow some odd pieces here and there among the lady passengers.
- Oh, murder. - That's a wonderful idea.
- You take that side, and I'll take this side. - Yes, sir.
And I'll take the neck.
Here, we've got some more. Or are you satisfied?
Satisfied?
I could lend you my earrings.
- Good morning. - Good morning.
Oh! Why, that's lovely. Now you won't need anything else.
That's what you think.
Yes, ma'am.
If there's one thing I admire... it's a woman who can whip up something out of nothing.
- You should taste my popovers. - I'd love to.
The homely virtues are so hard to find these days – a woman who can sew and cook and bake, even if she doesn't have to.
- And knit and – - And weave.
You're joking, but I mean, seriously, that is a woman.
Were you going to buy me some breakfast... or would you like me to bake you something here at the table?
I like a witty woman too. Now, what will you have?
The 35-cent breakfast seems the best at first glance... but if you analyze it for solid value, the 55-center is the one.
- I wouldn't want to impose. - No. Feel free to choose anything you like.
There's even a 75-cent breakfast if it appeals to you.
- We might share one. - Wait a minute.
With two eggs, toast and choice of fruit thrown in...
I'm not sure the 75-cent breakfast isn't the best value after all.
- Do we dare?
- I'm not really the way you think I am.
It's just my upbringing. Oh, waiter.
- Yes, sir. - Two 75-cent breakfasts, please.
- I'll start with a prairie oyster. - Yes, ma'am.
It's a very tempting choice in the $1.10 breakfast.
Two 75-cent breakfasts.
I'll start with a prairie oyster, also, whatever it is.
- Make mine on the half shell. - Yes, sir.
- Prairie oysters is à la carte. - All right, all right.
They always get the best of you somehow.
- Now, you say you have no ticket?
- That's right.
Naturally, I can't buy you a ticket – a perfectly strange young woman.
- Naturally. - In the first place, you wouldn't accept it.
- In the second place – - There's the expense.
I wasn't actually thinking of that. Now, I get off at Jacksonville.
I guess I do, too, unless they throw me off sooner.
Suppose we go to a store in Jacksonville and buy you the few little things you need... and then you come the rest of the way with me by boat?
You won't have had to accept a ticket from somebody you don't know... but you'll still get to where you're going.
- How's that?
- I don't have to row, do I?
Two prairie oysters.
Oh, very nice. Let's have that one too.
- How much is it?
- That is 212.50, monsieur.
- We'll take it. - We'll take it.
I – I didn't expect you to buy me all this stuff.
I really don't think I can accept it.
If you'd just get me a dress and some shoes and a hat.
Really more in the nature of a loan.
Nonsense.
It's cheaper in the end to buy good quality... and enough of them so that you don't wear them out.
They last longer, they look better... and there's a certain pleasure to having a change.
Well, that's awfully kind of you.
Are you sure you can afford all this?
I think so. We haven't done anything very extravagant yet.
Well, I'd hate to have you end up on a chain gang.
- I think we're still perfectly safe.
- You're really sure it's all right?
- Oh, certainly.
- You're not a burglar or something?
- Oh, no. That was my grandfather.
At least, that's what they called him.
Oh. Yes.
Do you like this one?
Oh, it's lovely.
But aren't the sleeves a little short?
Oh, that is for the bracelet, monsieur.
That is what we call the bracelet length.
Oh. Would you like a bracelet?
What kind of a bracelet do you mean?
- Any kind you like. - You mean with stones?
Certainly with stones!
They are all the rage.
Why not?
What kind of stones do you like?
- Well –
- Red!
- That is all the rage. - You mean like garnets?
Don't you think garnets are a little lifeless?
Oh.
Why, certainly.
This is great fun.
I've never bought things for a girl before – I mean, in any such quantities.
You've been denying yourself, monsieur... one of the basic pleasures in life.
I guess I have.
- All right. - Plus tax.
Yes, it's these taxes that get you down.
I keep feeling that two men with butterfly nets... are going to creep up behind you and lead you away.
You're thinking of my uncle. I'm not the crazy one in the family.
- I'm perfectly normal. - Why do you travel around in a lower berth?
I find it a little stuffy in an upper.
- Oh, you mean why don't I take a stateroom?
- Yes. Staterooms are un-American.
- Well, thank you. - Don't mention it.
Now, if you can't think of anything else, we'd better get started.
Just charge everything, please, and have it put in the taxi. Good day.
- Excuse me. - Oh, I'm so sorry. Forgive me.
I'm so used to buying in stores where I'm known that it totally slipped my mind.
- Mr. Ha-Ha-Ha –
- That's all right.
Don't mention it.
- Excuse me, please. I didn't – - Good day.
Well, what are you standing there for?
Where are the packages?
How about some service!
Why do I got to do everything myself?
Is this yours?
Oh, yes. Actually, it was my grandfather's, but he didn't like it.
He only used it once. This was his hat.
Do you happen to remember how much tip I gave the taxi driver?
Well, I didn't see the coin... but from his face, I think it was 10 cents.
Tipping is un-American.
- What's your name?
- Hackensacker.
Not John D. Hackensacker?
Oh, I'm not my grandfather, of course.
He's dead anyway. I'm John D., III.
Then you're one of the richest men in the world.
- Yes, I suppose so. - I would step on your face.
That's quite all right. I rather enjoyed it.
- Twice!
- You made quite an impression.
- May I get you a rug, madam?
- Oh, no, thank you.
Will you dine on deck, Mr. Hackensacker, or in the saloon?
We can have it on deck, if you like, but it blows everything all over the place.
There are a lot of inconveniences to yachting... that most people don't know anything about.
- Give me the peaceful train. - In the saloon, please.
Very good, madam.
See what I mean?
I just happen to own this thing, or I'd never go near it.
- Did you say you were John D., III or IV?
- The Third.
The Fourth will be my son, when I marry.
Oh. Then it really didn't mean anything to you... to buy me all those things, did it?
I can't pretend that it was a great sacrifice... but it did give me a great deal of pleasure.
You like to write in your little book.
It used to please my grandfather.
It's just a habit. It's nonsense really.
I write things down, but I never add them up.
- Where are you staying in Palm Beach?
- Oh, no place yet.
Where are you staying?
- At my sister's. - Oh, yes, the princess. Or is it the duchess?
- The Princess Centimillia. - Of course.
What are you going to Palm Beach for?
- A divorce. - Oh.
Well, you needn't look so sour about it.
Your sister's been divorced five times, hasn't she?
No, no. Three. She was annulled twice.
Oh. Well, I've never been divorced before.
Good. By the way, what is your name?
Oh, Jeffers. Geraldine Jeffers.
- Was he brutal to you?
- Huh? Oh, not particularly.
A drunkard, huh?
No, not congenital or anything like that.
Women always protect the man they've been married to.
Yes, I suppose it's human nature.
Did he beat you?
- Not often. - The hound.
Oh, a man's a man, I suppose. They're all tarred with the same brush.
How brave you are. When I marry, there'll be no divorce.
That's why I've been a little cautious.
- You're afraid somebody will marry you for your money. - Oh, I expect that.
When money reaches certain proportions...
- you can't ignore it any more than you can a-a –
- A horse in a bedroom.
I wasn't thinking exactly of that, but it'll serve.
I see marriage as a sort of permanent welding... a growing together of two trees – in spite of anything my sister can demonstrate to the contrary – into a sort of permanent mess – mass.
Like a permanent grafting of two trees into a permanent graft.
Oh, that one's too easy.
Oh, you mean a permanent graft.
I get it. But it doesn't have to be.
- It can be very nice, I'm sure. - Oh, it can be.
And after the divorce, you have plans?
- Oh, yes. - Anybody I know?
I know almost everybody in Palm Beach.
Oh, no. I haven't picked him out yet. Just some very rich man.
Some very rich man?
Oh, I wasn't thinking of anyone as rich as you.
- That might get to be annoying. - It is.
Is it?
No, I just meant somebody who's well fixed... and who could spare the $99,000 without missing it too much.
I'm not quite sure I understand about the $99,000.
Well, you see, he just happens to need $99,000.
And, after all, I don't see any reason why he shouldn't get it... if I'm throwing it out the windows.
- This is your last husband you're talking about?
- Yes. - He wants to sell you for $99,000?
- Oh, no.
- I don't think he had any such idea at all. - What do you call it?
Well, I mean, after all, I – He's entitled to something.
I mean, he did protect me and give me food, such as it was... and clothes, such as they were, for a few years.
- And now, if I can repay – - But the man is a vermin. No court of law –
- Don't you think I'm worth $99,000?
- That has nothing to do with it.
You're probably worth that, twice that, three times.
But even so, the days of serfdom – I mean bondage –
I mean, the days you bought a wife for a cow are over. I never heard of such a thing.
Chivalry is not only dead, it's decomposed.
Well, how much did this yacht cost you?
That is entirely beside the point. A woman is not a vessel.
Of all the filthy things I've heard in my life, I still –
- How does he want it?
- In cash maybe.
In cash, so I won't stop the check. The scoundrel.
I don't mean me. I mean whoever's –
Oh, well, I don't think he'll ever get it. It was just an idea.
There is a name for such reptiles... but I won't sully this sweet ocean breeze by mentioning it.
I may not be exactly in the best of shape... but if ever I meet this Mr. Jeffers...
I'll thrash him within an inch of his life.
Oh, then I hope you never meet him.
- I suppose he's large. - Well, he's not small.
That's one of the tragedies of this life – that the men who are most in need of a beating up are always enormous.
She's a tall, dark-haired girl with big eyes.
Yes, sir. I know who you talkin' about.
- You mean the young lady that lose all her clothes. - Lost all her clothes?
Yes, sir. But we fix her up with a blanket when she got off at Jacksonville.
- She got off at Jacksonville?
- Yes, sir.
- Alone?
- Well, you might practically say she's alone.
The gentleman that got off with her... give me 10 cents from New York to Jacksonville.
Watch your step, lady. She's alone, but she don't know it.
Never mind the philosophy. Then she's at Jacksonville!
Yes, sir. No, sir.
Oh, she said that he said... he was gonna take her down there on his boat.
I suppose she means "yachet."
But I don't see how no gentleman can give me a dime... from New York to Jacksonville can have a yachet.
Maybe a canoe or a bicycle. Yes, sir.
- Hey, let me use these a minute, will you?
- Thanks. - Anytime.
I think you'll like Palm Beach very much.
Yoo-hoo!
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's my sister, the princess. Hello, Maude.
Hello, Snoodles. Where'd you get the pretty girl?
- Greetings. - She calls me Snoodles.
- Is that the prince?
- No, the prince is all washed up.
- This is something new. - It might be a duke.
It might be her tailor too. She goes out with anything.
Hello, darling. What a perfectly beautiful day.
Were you seasick on the way down?
Wherever did you find her?
- This is Toto. Say "How do you do?" Toto. - Greetings.
Toto's a refugee – from his creditors, I think.
Greetings.
- Glad to be aboard, sir. How are you, darling?
- Hello, Maude.
Hello. Glad to see you aboard. You get prettier as one gets nearer.
- Thank you. - How did you manage it?
He's stiffer than a plank.
- This must have done him a power of good. - This is my sister. Maude, Mrs. –
Don't tell me he doesn't even know your name! This is perfectly marvelous.
Tell me he picked you up on the train and you'll make me a happy woman.
- Greetings. - All right, Toto, you've said "How do you do?"
Wait till I tell the papers.
Maude, somebody meeting you for the first time, not knowing you were cracked...
- might get the wrong impression. - Did he really pick you up on the train?
I was in awful trouble until he nobly came to my rescue.
Now you've spoiled everything.
I hoped for once he hadn't done anything noble... that he was really cooking with gas.
- What a lovely suit. - He bought me this.
Why, Snoodles, you rat.
We'll work this into something yet.
This is perfectly electrifying. You must come and stay with us, and we'll warm this up.
- You're divorced, of course. - No, no. Not quite.
That's marvelous. I don't think I'm quite through with the prince yet either.
We can look for new husbands together.
I'm thinking of an American at the moment. It seems more patriotic.
- Greetings. - No, no, Toto. His English is a little elementary.
- Nitz. What language does he speak?
I don't know. I think it's Baluchistan, but it's impossible to tell.
- Hello. - Let's go ashore.
I'll put you in the blue suite. We'll have a wonderful time.
You're perfectly respectable.
As long as we don't roll on the floor... and give the butler hysterics, we'll be cooking on the front burner.
- I talk a lot, don't I?
- Yes.
Ah, Snoodles, you snake in the grass!
Did you get him drunk, or how did you do it?
- You'll have to tell me all about it later. - Maude.
Look at that very handsome man. I wonder who he is.
I don't think I've seen him around before.
I thought I knew all the handsome men in this village.
- We could use some new faces. - It isn't possible.
What isn't possible?
I think I know that man. In fact, I'm sure of it.
What did you follow me down here for anyway?
What do you mean what did I follow you down here for?
You're my wife, aren't you?
You're making an ass of yourself, exposing yourself to all sorts of dangers...
- that I promised to love, honor and protect you from. - But that isn't fair!
- Will you realize that I'm doing this for you too?
- I don't want you to do any more.
But I've left you. I'm not your wife any longer.
- You're not my husband. - Gerry, darling.
- No, no. Stop it. - Well, I must say you do know him!
This is the Princess Centimillia.
My brother, Captain Mc – McGlue.
- What?
- Captain. We should have met sooner.
If I'd seen you around, we would have.
This is my brother, Captain Hackensacker. Captain McGlue – that's an odd name.
- Yes, isn't it?
How do you do, Captain?
- I'm not a captain.
That's my sister's joke because I own a yacht.
That's my sister's joke because I don't own one.
Very glad to meet you. Your sister didn't tell me she had a brother here.
- No, I just dropped over. - You're staying with us, of course.
No, we wouldn't want to inconvenience you. We'll go to a hotel.
- Inconvenience us?
Bumble puppy. - But, Mac –
We practically run a hotel. This will give the servants some exercise.
I won't take no for an answer. Your brother's a very fine-looking man.
You look exactly alike. I suppose he's married.
- No, no. He's entirely free. - You don't tell me.
- Now, look – - Don't pay any attention to her, Captain.
- Her bark is worse than her bite. - That's what you think.
I wish I hadn't brought Toto along today.
Somebody think of an errand to send him on.
- Hello. - Toto, this is Captain McGlue.
I'm going to see more of him and less of you from now on.
- Hello. - Listen carefully, dear. I left my handkerchief –
On the yacht. You go fetch it, see?
- Nitz. - Yitz, Toto.
- Nitz. - It'll be nitz to you, Toto.
And now, Captain, you may take my arm.
- Uh – - What did you say you were captain of?
I didn't say a word about it.
How wonderful it is meeting a silent American again.
All my husbands were foreigners. And such chatterboxes.
I could hardly get a word in edgeways.
- They make a handsome couple, don't they?
- Pardon? My sister and your brother. It'd be nice if something came of it.
Oh – Oh!
Oh, yes, wouldn't it?
It would be wonderful for him.
Of course, she's no bargain, but it might happen very easily.
She's a woman of iron determination.
Once her mind is made up, you might as well yield.
I can see what you mean.
- I'm glad you're gonna stay with us, and your brother too. - Are you?
I don't know why I didn't think of it, or maybe I did think of it.
But it took someone of my sister's courage to make it come true.
- You're very sweet. - Thank you very much.
The captain's a big fellow, isn't he?
- Yes, isn't he?
- You look exactly alike.
Yes, don't we?
You know, people always remark on it.
Why don't you marry her?
She's lovely.
In the first place, she isn't free yet.
In the second place, you don't marry somebody you just met the day before.
- At least, I don't. - But that's the only way, dear.
If you get to know too much about them, you'd never marry them.
I'd marry Captain McGlue tomorrow.
- Even with that name. - And divorce him next month.
Nothing is permanent in this world except Roosevelt, dear.
As a matter of fact, Maude, I'm becoming very attracted to this young woman...
- more so than anyone I've known the same length of time. - Aha.
But I want to know how she is early in the morning, late at night, rain or shine... under trying circumstances – as when the servants leave in a body –
- how she is with children –
- What are you gonna do – rent some?
Why not?
Perhaps we could borrow some.
- You mean a mock marriage?
- I certainly do not.
I revere marriage, unlike some people I could mention.
Oh, here.
But why "Captain McGlue"?
Of all the idiotic names.
Because I want him to build your airport for you, darling.
He seems to have something against my husband.
I don't know why. But as my brother –
Apart from the fact that I wouldn't let him build a chicken coop for me...
I'd still like to know why I'm to be called Captain McGlue.
- Of all the nincompoopish – - Wasn't that your mother's name?
What – Captain McGlue?
Really, Geraldine.
Her name was McGrew. M-C-G-R-E-W.
Oh, well, I'm sorry, darling. I remembered it as McGlue.
Yes, well, I guess I'm stuck with it now. Captain McGlue.
What am I supposed to be captain of – a garbage scow?
I put that in to make it more dignified.
- Couldn't you have been a captain in the last war?
- Sure.
I was 11 years old at the finish, a captain in knee britches.
- What about the Boy Scouts?
- Wonderful.
I could go around building bonfires on the drawing room carpet.
I'm sorry, darling. I really meant it for the best.
I know you did. That's what's so irritating about it.
Where'd you get the brother idea?
Because you had your arms around me.
I suppose no one's ever had his arms around you except your brother... only you haven't got one.
I don't suppose Captain Hackensacker ever put his arms around you.
- Of course not. - Of course not.
Yachts must have changed since the last time I was on one.
That's what they build yachts for.
Naturally, he will put his arms around me when and if we're engaged.
- Oh, we're engaged now, are we?
- Is there anything wrong with being engaged?
You oughta know. Where'd you get that suit?
That's what I was telling you about.
- What's that you've got on your wrist?
- Just what you think it is, dear.
- What kind of stones are those?
- Exactly what they look like.
Do you know what it feels like to be strangled with bare hands?
Oh, now wait a minute, darling.
I've always been on the level with you, and I always will be.
- Here. - What's that supposed to be?
You put that over on the mantelpiece.
Lovebirds, huh?
Now, so long as that's there... you won't have the slightest, smallest thing to be unhappy about.
That'll be a signal, and we'll never have to mention the subject.
- And that goes for you too. - Huh?
And your friend the princess you seem to be cutting such a groove with.
Princess.
Say, where'd you get the money to fly down here anyway?
Same place you got yours, only I didn't have to kiss him good-bye.
Oh, the Wienie King.
He wanted us to get back together, I guess.
Don't you think we owe it to him?
Why don't you let me go out there and poke that guy in the nose?
Just once.
Because I've left you, darling, for both our good. Now just –
Excuse me.
Mac, did you happen to – You don't mind if I call you "Mac," do you?
- Did you happen to bring a tuxedo with you?
- I did not.
The business I came here to tend to didn't call for one.
- And you can stop pulling my coat. - That's perfectly all right.
- In a pinch, you can wear one of mine. - In a pinch!
That's very funny.
- I won't be here that long. - Why, Mac.
That's too bad, old man. I'd hoped you'd spend the season with us.
I wanted to get to know you better.
There's something I want to talk to you about before you go.
- I'm very glad you showed up when you did. - So am I.
- Good. I needed a male member of Gerry's family. - You have him.
Fine. Now I have a certain thought.
I have a certain thought also, and it's that bracelet.
- Mac!
- I'm very glad you brought that up.
Mac is delighted with it, Snoodles.
- He shouldn't be. - He isn't.
Fine. The first bracelet my sister got, I punched the fellow in the nose.
- Fellow by the name of Wallace. - I can see we understand each other perfectly.
- I didn't like it any more than you do this. - You're reading my mind.
Splendid, but there's a difference between Wallace and me.
- I'm not interested in Wallace. - There's no reason why you should be.
- Now I, on the other hand –
- If I could trust you two boys not to slug each other...
I'd like to make an exit right about here.
I feel like a bone between two dogs.
We're going to get along together all right.
There's nothing the matter with my intentions, as Mac will be the first to admit.
The only thing that could embarrass you... would be the lovely things I want to say to him about you – your face, your form – things that a brother is naturally blind to.
- Is that so?
- Geraldine's future... and this little plan I have which I'd better discuss with you before –
- What's buzzin', cousins? What's the dirt?
- Never mind, Maude.
- It's just a little something I want to discuss with Mac.
My dear, when you hear what it is, you will simply expire.
- Maude!
Maude, please!
- It's too, too excruciating!
He wants a miniature marriage with you.
- A miniature what?
- Go away, Toto. This is not for children.
You know, everything up to the dissolve... and then "Good night, sweetheart.
I'll see you in the morning." - What's this?
- The boy wants to bundle!
Maude.
And then he's gonna make you cook and sew and wash the windows... and then he's gonna get some little brats to see if you know how to change them.
- But how?
- He's going to rent them!
Oh!
Let's you and me go someplace. They want to be alone.
- But just a minute. I –
- Don't take it so seriously.
- They want to bake a cake, dear. - They want to bake a wha –
Well, I –
I don't know what to say.
I didn't realize it was so humorous.
Did you really want to put me through all that?
There's no use trying to conceal it now.
I might have guessed it on the train.
I certainly should have known it in Jacksonville and on the yacht.
The trial was as much for you as for me.
And however ridiculous I may seem... there's nothing ridiculous about the way I feel in my heart.
- I'm madly in love with you. - Aw .
Oh, isn't that pretty?
Why do you keep bothering them all the time?
If you want to bother somebody, bother me.
You know, I'm not sure that Mac likes me.
Oh, no, no, no. He's always like that.
It's just that he doesn't seem to think anybody's good enough for me.
Well, he's right there.
You don't care much for me, do you?
Why, certainly.
Why do you let me flop around?
I'm sorry.
You will care for me though. I grow on people – like moss.
Sit down, Toto. Stop following me around.
Zitz. - Nitz. - Yitz, Toto.
♪ Isn't it romantic? ♪
♪ La-da-da-da da-dee-dee ♪♪
Oh, you have a nice little voice.
Thank you. I used to sing in college.
- With a mandolin?
- I wouldn't play it around the house.
- Would you be around the house much?
- Not any more than you wanted me.
I have an office, not that I do much in it.
Perhaps Mac could come and help me.
That would be wonderful!
- You two could plan the airport together.
- What airport is that?
The most remarkable invention you've ever heard of.
A suspended airport right in the middle of the city... stretched like a tennis racket.
But would it be strong enough? After all, a tennis racket –
- What's Gerry's husband like?
- Who?
Oh, just a flop.
- A big flop?
- Yes, any way you take it.
Well, he won't be such a flop with his $99,000.
Snoodles will give it to him, all right. And why not?
I oughta marry him and get it back into the family.
That would be a big joke. Of course, I'm crazy. I'll marry anyone.
- What's this about $99,000?
- I might be able to help him.
In fact, I will be able to help him. In fact, I'll help him. Why not?
- Will you really?
- Of course I will, up to a certain point.
How much would a working model cost?
Ninety-nine thou – I mean, $100,000 – in that neighborhood.
That shouldn't be a very difficult neighborhood to find.
I think I'll be able to do it all right.
Oh, really?
You've made me so happy.
- You don't know how much trouble he's had. - Is that so?
He won't know what trouble really is till he tangles up with Maude.
Oh, that's rather unkind. I shouldn't have said it.
- You say about a hundred thousand?
- Exactly a hundred thousand.
- It's built. - Oh!
You mean her husband wants $99,000 before he'll give her a divorce?
Oh, I love you like this, with lightning flashing out of your eyes.
- Did she tell you that story?
- Why should we talk about that heel when you're here?
- Did she tell you that?
- Do that again. I love it.
Listen.
Oh, Snoodles, that's wonderful!
Tom – Mac will be wild with excitement.
You know, when you've waited so long.
Not at all. Not at all. I'm delighted to have the opportunity.
- Look – - Darling, I have the most wonderful news.
Snoodles is going to build your airport for you.
- Why should he build it?
I'll build it. - You don't even know what it is.
Quiet, Toto.
That gives us a lot to look forward to, doesn't it?
I don't know as I've told you, Mac... but your sister and I have progressed considerably since this afternoon.
Oh, is that so?
What's all this business about your husband wanting $99,000... before he sets you free?
Oh, that was just an idea that he had.
You know how people are when they're upset.
I'm not sure that he actually meant it. Let's not even talk about it.
No, no, let's face it.
Gerry naturally wants to defend this human bacterium.
That's only natural and gallant. But the fact of the matter is he's asked her for it.
- And as soon as my name comes into it, we're doomed. - Broiled.
As a Hackensacker, I find it cheaper to pay than to fight.
Of course, $99,000 isn't a small sum, but it isn't large.
I should say not. Why, when I think of Stefan, to say nothing of Serge.
Or that big one with the scar –
- What was his name?
- Itsk.
Baron Itsk!
Lucius.
- Itsk? - Nitz, Toto.
I'm awfully sorry to hear that about Tom.
I knew he was a failure and a dreamer, I guess... but I didn't know he was a skunk.
It's very kind of you to want to build the airport – I mean, the model of it.
I guess I was a little too stunned to say thank you... but you know how it is when you've been waiting for something for a long time.
There's only one trouble with the whole setup... something that Gerry neglected to tell you.
That is that I'm not alone in this invention.
That human bacterium we were talking about – her husband – has had exactly as much to do with it as I have.
So, you see, if you help me, you'd be helping him too.
I know nothing could be further from your wish.
How about dancing with your brother?
Shut up, Toto. My brother is thinking.
What did you have to do that for, you fathead?
Don't you ever get tired of being noble?
Everything I build up for you you knock down.
- I've got you the money twice already. - Look, darling –
No, I don't want to listen to anything that begins with "Look, darling"... so that you can get off another noble saying.
Can't you ever learn to be practical?
Don't you know that the greatest men in the world have told lies... and let things be misunderstood if it was useful to them?
Didn't you ever hear of a campaign promise?
The way you are is the way you have to be, honey.
That's the way I am. If I'm supposed to be a flop –
You're not going to be a flop.
Nobody who's been married to me for five years is going to be a flop.
You're going to get your airport... if I have to build it for you myself.
After I'm married.
After you're married.
That's a funny thing to hear your wife say.
I'll build it, and his share will be more than $99,000... so he'll have to release you.
- Whose share?
- That scoundrel she's married to.
Isn't that brilliant?
It's the first bright thought he's ever had.
- That's marvelous!
- It was really very simple.
Now shall we change partners?
It seems a shame... to waste such a beautiful sister upon a brother that doesn't appreciate her.
You said it.
Ah, thank you so much. It was delightful.
Not at all.
Oh, dear!
- What's the matter?
- We must've forgotten Toto someplace.
- Oh, is that so?
- I suppose he'll show up though. He always does.
- Greetings!
- Ah, yes.
Wouldn't he be awful to be married to?
Always hanging around.
Captain, you have renewed my faith in mankind.
Well, there's nothing like saving your faith.
You are too, too divine!
You're a very embarrassing lady.
If I weren't a little bit mixed up at the moment...
I'd take you up on a few of your dares and make you say "papa."
Papa.
How would you like to go to Fort Myers tomorrow?
There's nothing there, but the ride might be nice.
- We might put Toto in the army. - I may not be here tomorrow.
What do you mean you may not be here tomorrow?
I'm a little mixed up, but I sort of have an appointment in New York.
Oh, let her wait, whoever she is.
She's no good for you anyway, while I, on the other hand –
You never think of anything but topic "A," do you?
Is there anything else?
I'll leave you with that thought, Captain.
Bonsoir, Drip-drap.
Oh, dear. You're very kind.
I think this is the happiest night of my life.
- Oh, really, Snoodles?
- Yes.
You've freed me of a certain timidity from which I've always suffered.
And now with you and Mac and the airport...
- I can see great days ahead full of fun and everything. - I'm sure of it, Snoodles.
By the way, I have a little surprise for you in a few minutes.
- So don't be surprised. - What is it?
If I told you what it is, then it wouldn't be a surprise anymore.
Well, I wouldn't do anything too surprising if I were you, Snoodles.
You never can tell how those things are going to turn out.
I'm persuaded you'll be delighted.
Well, I certainly hope I will be.
- If you'll just leave your window open onto the balcony. - What?
What was that?
- Oh, I didn't hear anything. Good night, Snoodles. - I'll see you in a little while.
- Good night. - I'll see you in my dreams.
Yes, that's a very good place.
- You're a fast worker, aren't you?
- You have your nerve to talk.
So you couldn't even wait a decent interval, you and your princess.
I hope you're very proud of yourself, Captain McGlue!
- Wait a minute. - No, let me go, you big pullover!
No, no. I just broke that because it was handy.
Oh! Well, then you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- I'm the one that has the right to –
- I know I'm an idiot.
But I suppose it's when you've been fond of somebody for a long time –
You shouldn't have come down here.
You had no right to come down here.
You should have given me a little time to get used to the idea.
Maybe I should, but you can't blame a man... for trying to hold on to something that he loves... that he always has loved and always will love.
- You're going to make me cry. - Gerry.
No!
You're forgetting the airport.
You're forgetting everything that counts.
- Gerry. - No!
It's all finished!
When you make a decision, you have to stand by it.
You can't let champagne or – or tree toads... or night flowers or memories get in the way of it.
- It's all over. I-I know it's for the best. - But, Gerry, I –
On, no. Now listen to me just this once, will you?
I've always done what you wanted, and it's always turned out a disaster.
Good night, darling. Sleep tight.
It'll be funny sleeping with a sitting room between us.
- And the doors locked. - You won't have to worry about that.
Nevertheless, good night, dear.
- What?
- Well, don't you kiss your brother good night?
I don't know. I never had a brother.
You have one now.
You fool.

- I suppose there's a law against shooting those things. - Yes, ma'am, I think there is.
- Oh, good morning, Toto. - Greetings.
It doesn't seem to matter how much champagne you soak up... you always feel great the next morning.
- Hello. - Thank you, darling.
I suppose it takes an iron constitution to be a houseguest.
- Why don't you go away someplace? - Eh?
There must be somebody else who can use a houseguest.
I can't be the only sucker in the world. Why don't you go to Havana?
That's a nice place, and I'd treat you to a nice one-way ticket.
Havanag?
Youg, meeg – Havanag?
Nog, Toto. Youg – Havanag. Meeg – here.
- Nitz. - I was afraid of that.
Say, Maude, is this all right?
You have to work fast in these matters.
So I just slid down to Margetson's and slid back with this. Hello.
- What is it – the Hope Blue?
- No, no. It's just a chip from it.
Boy, when you fall, you fall, don't you?
- Go away, Toto. This might give you ideas. - It's all right then?
- I think she'll know what you mean. - Good.
How do you think this would look on the captain's vest?
Maude, you're really incorrigible.
No, no, Toto. Naughty, naughty. Here.
I suppose I'll have to give the bracelet back, won't I?
- Why?
- Oh!
Oh, dear.
What are you talking about?
Oh, Snoodles, I'm so fond of you.
You're a lovely, generous, good-hearted man, really a woman's ideal.
- Only you shouldn't have sung last night. - What?
Here's your bracelet. I'm going back to my husband.
- That skunk?
- Oh, he isn't really.
I let you think much worse about him than he is.
You know how a woman likes sympathy.
- But what about the $99,000?
- He didn't want that. I wanted it for him.
But –
- Put it away. - What?
- Put it away. - But, darling –
I'll just take one more look at it, and then put it away forever.
There's a limit to what a woman can stand.
Hello there, Snoodles. How's every little thing?
- I'm very unhappy, as a matter of fact. - You'll get over it.
- Do you know about Gerry's decision?
- Yes.
I'll never get over it as long as I live. I had such hopes, such plans.
Oh, Snoodles, I'm so sorry.
Anyway, we still have the airport. That'll keep us busy.
- What's knittin', kittens?
- Gerry's going back to her husband.
Oh, you poor, dumb thing. I know just how it is. I'll bet he's a knockout.
- I'm awfully sorry about Snoodles. - You still have your airport.
You and the captain and I will be as busy as bird dogs, won't we?
- I'm afraid that isn't possible either. - Why not?
I still have – I always will have – the deepest affection for you.
Certainly nothing has happened to spoil my friendship with your brother.
Being with him will remind me of you.
- Well, you see –
- What now?
- He isn't exactly my brother. - No.
- He isn't exactly your brother?
Hello!
Oh, shut up.
He-He – He's my husband.
- He's your husband!
- That's right.
Well, no wonder!
I thought I was losing my grip.
- You mean the vermin who-who –
- Who-Who what?
- That's right. You said he didn't. - Then who is McGlue?
- There is no McGlue. - Well, thank heavens for something. That name!
Then it's the Jeffers Airport. That's it, isn't it?
Are you still talking about that airport?
You really take it on the chin, don't you?
Why not?
If an idea has merit, it has merit.
Sentiment and business don't belong in the same bed.
After all, Grandfather loathed oil – it made his eyes water – but that didn't stop him from making millions out of it.
You still want to go through with the airport?
Why not?
On a purely business basis, of course.
Right now, I don't like you, although I may get over it later.
Right now, I need something to occupy my mind.
The airport is something, if not exactly what I'd hoped for.
- I'll be very lonely without you, Gerry. - Oh, Captain, and thou.
I don't suppose you have a sister.
Only a twin sister.
- A twin sister!
- Oh, didn't you know about that?
That's how we were married in the beginning, both being twins.
- That's another plot entirely. - Both twins!
- Are you a twin?
- Yes.
- Well, what's he doing?
- Well, what's she doing?
- Well, nothing.
Here come the wolves.
Uh-oh. Bottleneck. Mr. Roosevelt should hear of this.
I'm sorry. Hope you didn't hurt yourself.
My friend says he's sorry.
Okay.
That just goes to show you what a little blonde can do to hold up national defense.
Nice, pleasant guy.
Man! Gee, 100 bucks.
So that's what they look like.
Where'd he go?
I don't know. I wonder what his name is.
Wait a minute. I saw it on the envelope.
Fry. That's it. Fry.
Fry. How do you know my name?
What do you care how I know your name?
I saw it on one of the envelopes you dropped.
Here's something that belongs to you.
The paint shop!
Lt'll go up like dynamite!
Here, take this one. What about me? Don't I get to play, too?
So, I see these two kids, see.
And I yell at them, "The sprinklers are busted,
"the whole shooting match will go up."
And they run right in, the both of them.
And the last thing I saw when I looked back was one kid give the extinguisher to the other kid, and then it was just like all hell comes up.
That's all I see.
Was there anybody else around? No.
Just the two kids.
The poor kid with the extinguisher, and the one who gave it to him. Thank you, Rogers.
We appreciate all you've done.
We needn't keep you any longer now.
You'd better go and take care of those hands.
Who've you got next?
We have a fellow, Barry Kane, waiting.
Send Barry Kane in!
Barry Kane!
Just take it easy.
We only want to ask you a couple of questions, a matter of a routine check-up.
Well, I want to do anything I can to help.
Sure.
Now, suppose you tell us where you were when the fire started. Well, I was one of the first to rush in.
The sprinkler systems weren't working.
Who else was with you?
There were just myself, a fellow named Fry, and my friend Ken Mason.
Go on. Fry handed me an extinguisher, and I started running toward the fire.
I gave it to Ken.
And then he...
Okay. Take it easy. That's all.
Just stick around for a while. We may need you. Send for Fry.
Get hold of a fellow called Fry. What'd they do?
Ask you a lot of questions? No. Hardly any.
Gee, it's awful tough going, seeing it happen in front of you.
Yeah, it is tough.
Ken Mason was your pal, too, wasn't he? Yeah.
Was he married? No. He was living with his mother.
Must be pretty tough on her. Sorry, fellows.
I'll see you later.
Hello, Mrs. Mason.
They... They wouldn't let me see him. It's awful hard to believe.
It happened so quick.
Why, only this morning...
Please... Please don't talk about it now.
Anything I can do? Could I get you something? No.
No, thank you. Not now.
Maybe some brandy.
How is the poor, dear soul?
If you mean Mrs. Mason, she's feeling bad.
Oh, well, she has every reason to. Do you know what?
They wouldn't even let her see him. Her only son.
Yes, I know.
I told her she'd every right to insist on seeing him.
I told her I would, and she as good as told me to get out.
Me that was only trying to help the poor, dear soul.
I think you can help, if you'd tell me where I could get some brandy.
It doesn't seem to be in here.
You come with me, young man.
It just happens that I have a little in the house.
Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Mason, but we're looking for a guy named Barry Kane.
He isn't here right now, is he?
They told us at the plant we might be able to find him here.
Well, what do you want to see him about?
He's in pretty bad trouble, lady.
What is it? I'd like to know.
He was mixed up with that fire at the factory. I...
I don't understand.
There are a lot of things we don't understand, either.
But how is Barry involved in it?
That fire extinguisher. It seems it wasn't just an accident.
It turns out that the extinguisher Barry Kane handed your son was filled with gasoline.
You ought to be able to help us.
Give us a lead on this guy Kane.
Yeah. That's why we want to look around. Well...
I can't talk about it now. Yeah.
Sorry, but, you see, there was a...
I wouldn't give her too much of that if I were you, because it very often makes people weepy. I know it affected me like that...
Yes, Mrs. Moore, I've got to hurry back.
Thank you very much.
Try some of this, Mrs. Mason. It'll make you feel better.
There were two detectives just here.
They were looking for you. For me?
I guess they want to ask me some more questions.
I said that I'd do anything I could to help. Here.
Try, please. No. That wasn't it.
They said that the fire extinguisher that you handed to Kenneth was filled with gasoline, that you killed him.
That I killed...
Why, are they crazy? Why would I want to do a thing...
Why, Ken was my best friend! Haven't they talked to Fry?
Haven't they asked him about the extinguisher?
They said that there was no such man employed at the plant as Fry. Why, I saw him!
I saw him twice!
Ken saw him, too! He was right there with us at the fire. He handed me the extinguisher.
Ken said, "Don't I get to play, too?"
He was kidding. I handed it to him.
Fry was right there with us. I'm sure!
Why, he must have known there was gasoline in it.
He must have known!
He stood right there with us and watched, the...
Please go.
Don't you believe me?
Do you think I had something to do with this?
I didn't tell the police anything.
Oh, I don't know! It's all so confused and so terrible.
I don't know what they're talking about!
Why don't they get this fellow Fry?
You'd better go.
All right, I'll go.
I've got to get Fry.
I've got to find him, or Ken won't be the last one to die. He must be in there.
I saw him go in the back way.
Catchy. What?
That tune you're whistling.
Oh, I didn't even know I was whistling.
That's a sign you must be pretty happy.
Easy to see there's nothing on your mind.
Oops. That must have been Junior. It felt like him.
Junior?
Yeah, that rock we just got.
I know every one on the road from Los Angeles to Reno.
Tough job, driving a truck.
Got any other hot news tonight?
I guess I never realized how tough it was before.
The tough part, you can take that.
It's the monotony that gets you. I've been thinking for a long time I'm gonna get out of this trucking game.
Why don't you?
One of the neighbors told my wife it's stylish to eat three meals a day.
You married? Nope.
Go ahead and whistle.
That thing bother you?
What's doing it?
Here, stick this wad of paper in there, will you?
It's a pretty good thing to have around one of these extinguishers.
I wouldn't be without one.
Now, take the other day.
A big lettuce truck turns over right down the road here.
The gasoline catches and she goes up like a matchbox.
A fellow riding, a friend of the driver's, gets caught in it.
If the driver hadn't had an extinguisher, his pal would've been fried alive right in front of his eyes.
I didn't see it happen. I never see anything happen.
I don't even hear about anything, except what my wife tells me what she sees in the moving pictures.
That's the way she spends the money, moving pictures and new hats.
Buys a new hat so she can put it on to go to the picture shows, so she can take it off.
No, sir. I haven't got anything to whistle about.
Where're you from, bud?
Los Angeles.
Tough.
You work down there? Yeah. Well, I did.
What doing?
I was working in an airplane factory.
They say that's pretty good.
I was wondering why you weren't in the army.
Yeah. I understand that they all go particular about the fellows they hire in those big defense plants.
Well, that's no more than right.
They got to be careful they don't get blown up.
Yeah.
I understand if a fellow would've had any kind of police record, no job.
Is that right? Oh, I don't know.
Hey, buddy, hold the wheel a while, will you?
While I animate this thing. I'm a nicotine addict.
Hey, watch it, bud, will you? Stay on this side of the white line.
Where do you wanna get off when we get to Springville?
It doesn't matter. Just drop me in the middle of town, anywhere, when we get there.
Listen, the minute you get to Springville, you're in the middle of the town.
And the next minute, the place is just a memory.
Whole town isn't a city block long.
You going to one of those big ranches, outside, aren't you?
Yeah.
I'd be glad to drop you off at whatever one you want.
That's it! Deep Springs Ranch.
Hey! Say, that's a whale of a big place.
Got a chance of a job there? Yeah.
I think so.
You ought to like it. Nice climate. The police!
Maybe something's happened!
I'd like to have a little talk with you out here.
Yeah, sure, sure, Officer. Stay here a minute, buddy. I'll be right back.
Hey, bud! Come on. Everything's fixed.
Good night, Officer.
Can you imagine a thing like that?
Cop chasing, the sirens, the whole works!
And what it's all about is one of my taillights went out.
That's the trucking game for you in a nutshell.
Calling all highway patrolmen. Calling all highway patrolmen.
Be on lookout for a man named Barry Kane.
Last seen on Highway 99.
He has dark brown hair, blue eyes, height about 6'2", no hat, around 25 years old.
Calling all highway patrolmen. Calling all highway patrolmen.
How do you do? Is Mr. Frank Fry here?
No, this is Mr. Tobin's ranch.
Oh. Could I speak to Mr. Tobin?
Well, I'll see. Just a minute. You wait here, please.
There. We've got the ball. Now, throw it to me.
A young man to see you, sir.
Throw it to me. Where is Daddy's girl?
What did you say, Adele? Who wants to see me?
A young man, sir. He came to ask for a Mr. Fry.
Oh. Well, have him come out here, will you?
Yes, sir. Throw me the ball. Throw me the ball.
Here comes your granddaddy.
Mr. Tobin will see you. Follow me, please. Hi.
How do you do? I'm Charles Tobin.
This is my daughter, Mrs. Brown. How do you do?
How do you do?
Well, I'm not gonna ask you to excuse the informality of this costume.
We're all informal out here at Deep Springs Ranch.
That's one of the rules of the place. I see.
Do you want me to take Susie with me so you won't be disturbed?
No, Susie isn't gonna disturb us at all.
You just let her play right here, and I'll see she doesn't fall in the pool.
All right.
Well, shall we sit out here?
Yes, sir. It seems a shame to go indoors on such a beautiful day.
Yes, it does.
You wanted to see me about something, huh?
Yes, sir. I'm looking for a man named Fry, Frank Fry.
I met him up in Los Angeles. I understand he lives here.
Oh, no, no.
Fry, huh?
Frank Fry? I'm afraid I don't know anybody by that name.
Wait a minute. Fry. No, no.
I just don't seem to be able to place it. Uh-huh.
There used to be a fellow with a name something like that, worked around here.
No. No. It wasn't Fry.
Well, I'm afraid you found the wrong address.
It couldn't be one of the cowhands, or maybe somebody who is working...
No. No. I know the names of all my men.
Wait a minute. My next door neighbor...
Well, next door neighbor, he lives 20 miles from here.
But he may know your friend.
I'll telephone him.
Oh, no, please don't. No! Not at all.
You look as though you've had a hard journey.
It's just too bad you had to come all this way for nothing.
Now, if you'll just wait a minute, at least we can find out.
Will you see that Susie doesn't fall into the pool? Yes, sir. Thank you.
Hey. Come here.
Come over here.
Oh, so you're a ballplayer, are you? Wanna throw me the ball?
Let me have it. Come on. Throw me the ball.
That's right. Throw me the other one. Come on.
Throw it to me. Come on. Give me the ball.
That's fine. Fine! Now, I'll throw it back.
Where are you going? Uh-oh. Don't do that.
Leave those where they are. Leave them right there.
You wanna be a good girl? Put these back where you found them. No, no, Susie.
The gentleman says put them back where you found them.
The gentleman knows that you must be very careful with letters that don't belong to you.
Probably I'm prejudiced, but it seems to me that Susie is a pretty cute young lady.
Yeah, she's great. Where's Frank Fry?
Well, really, you must do something about that memory of yours.
You know that it wasn't a minute ago that you read a telegram that Fry sent me.
And it said that he was on his way to Soda City.
Don't you remember that?
Where's Soda City?
Well, I haven't given it much thought, but I wouldn't imagine there'd be an overabundance of Soda Citys on the map.
I suppose there's some way of finding out bringing you last-minute headlines.
Los Angeles.
The fire in the Stewart Aircraft Works, in which one man was killed, many injured, and half a million dollars worth of damage caused, has been definitely set down to sabotage.
Police have traced the incendiary origin of the blaze to Barry Kane, former aircraft...
Don't want any more of that.
You'd think you'd be rather bored with descriptions of yourself.
Or maybe you'll never get tired of them.
Well, I am, by this time. I've been listening to those radio reports all morning.
All right, you knew me. What about it?
Oh, quite a lot about it, Mr. Kane. You ought to know that.
You've become too famous to remain so modest.
Tell me one thing.
Why are you covering up Frank Fry?
What's a man like you in this for?
Well, young man, I don't know what you're talking about.
I think maybe you do!
Frank Fry is a saboteur who doesn't mind killing Americans for money.
You must watch yourself, Mr. Kane.
I'm telling you this for your own benefit, but you have the makings of an outstanding bore.
You can't get away with this, Tobin!
Even if I don't stop you, there'll be others who will.
A man like you can't last in a country like this.
Very pretty speech.
Youthful, passionate, idealistic.
You see, I've already sent for the police.
You can't bluff me. You're hooked, and you know it.
Must I remind you that you are the fugitive from justice, and not I?
I'm a prominent citizen, widely respected.
You are an obscure young workman, wanted for the committing of an extremely unpopular crime.
Now, which of us do you think the police will believe, hmm?
Oh, you must think me a very poor host, Mr. Kane.
Now, don't you feel that a long cold drink is indicated?
Well, I guess I've found out everything you're gonna tell me.
I'll have to go on now and do the rest by myself.
You mean you wish to leave us?
Adele, Adele! Mr. Kane is going!
I'm sorry. You'll stop, please.
What does that shoot? Water? Bullets, I'm afraid.
You shouldn't be so anxious to leave us, Mr. Kane.
You'll hurt our feelings.
You make it very hard for me to refuse your invitations. Susie, come on.
No, no, Susie!
Come here. Hello, Susie.
You know where we're going? We're going for a piggyback ride.
That's right. You like piggyback rides?
Get after him! Hurry up! Get him!
Get after him! Hurry up!
Get going. Wait a minute.
You can't take me away like this!
Don't tell us what we can't do, chum. Go on, get started.
I tell you, you've got to get him!
Just because he's got a big ranch and a fancy pool and a lovely house doesn't mean he's a nice guy.
Why don't you find out the kind of things he's been doing? Sure, sure.
We know all about that. Just come on along. The baby had the letters, I tell you.
Oh, of course, Susie would be only too glad to cooperate, but, you see, it'll be quite a few months before she'll be of any assistance.
No, no, Susie. Those are not for Susie.
Those are for the gentleman. All right, let's go.
Where're we going?
We're gonna let you get a little idea of the county jail.
You won't find it the best in the West.
But it won't hurt you to rough it for a couple of days till they come up from Los Angeles for you.
You can't hold me without a warrant.
Chum, do I have to keep asking you not to tell us what we can't do?
You give me a break. There isn't time!
Time's the one thing you don't need to worry about.
You'll have it to burn.
You'll have 20 years, nice and quiet, if you get the right lawyer.
And if you don't, you'll have all the time there is. What's wrong, Mac?
What's holding us up?
Truck ahead, blocking the whole road.
Looks like they're changing a tire.
Got a cigarette? Sure. All you want.
Hiya, bud! Hey, what's the matter?
There he goes! There he is!
Hello there. Hello.
I got caught in this storm. I'm pretty wet, I'm afraid.
Maybe you'd like to come inside and get dry.
Did you leave your car down on the road? Why don't you bring it up and put it in the shed?
I'm afraid it won't do it any good standing in the rain.
I don't have any car.
You might say I'm traveling by thumb.
By thumb? Yeah, I'm a hitchhiker.
Oh, I see.
I've always thought that, that was the best way to learn about this country and the surest test of the American heart.
Yes, I guess it is.
Will you go to the fire and dry your clothes? Thanks.
Thanks.
I think that they'd dry more quickly if you hung them up and put on something of mine.
Oh, no, thanks! This is fine.
We could do with another log on the fire. Would you?
Why, sure.
You must stay until this blows over.
It won't detain you long.
These autumn storms are short.
They yield to none in wetness, but they are short. Yes, I...
I'm sorry, I should have warned you. Those logs are heavier than you'd think.
I drop them constantly.
Yes, they are heavy.
I guess I was too smart trying to pick it up with one hand.
Good job it didn't land on your foot.
That often happens to me. You're lucky. Yeah.
I'm lucky.
Oh, I was forgetting. My name is Phillip Martin.
Oh, I'm Barry... Mason.
I'm glad you found yourself near here, Mr. Mason, when the storm came.
It's a pleasant thing to have a guest sharing the fire when the rain is beating on the roof.
You live here alone, do you, sir?
Yes. Except I really don't think of it in that way.
You see, sounds are my light and my colors. My music, for example.
I compose a little.
And there's nobody to tell me that the results are anything but brilliant, so I live in a comfortable glow of self-appreciation.
I'm afraid I prefer playing the works of other composers.
Undoubtedly, you'd prefer listening to them.
I used to play the triangle in our high school band.
Of course that was a long time ago.
Oh, that's too bad.
It's unfortunate when you let yourself get out of practice on the triangle.
The piano is a boon to me.
The piano can't know that you're blind, so it doesn't embarrass you by trying to make things easier for you.
It does you the compliment to trust you.
Delius, the British composer, was blind too.
That's our only resemblance.
This is his Summer Night on the River.
A very interesting effect, obligato on an apple.
Oh, I apologize, Mr. Mason.
I forgot how hungry you must be after your long walk.
Just a moment. I'll get something.
Oh, no. Thanks. This is fine.
I like apples. So do I. We'll save them for dessert.
It was all ready, you see.
All I needed was a reminder that I was hungry, too.
Are you dry enough?
Just about, sir.
It stopped raining.
Is that a car coming?
Two cars, I think. Excuse me.
One car is my niece's. I'd know the sound of that motor anywhere.
The other is a stranger to me.
There's a couple of men in it.
The girl's standing beside it, pointing down the road. They must've asked her where to go.
This is an easy country to lose your way in.
That's one of its charms.
The car is moving. It's starting off down the road now.
The girl's coming up the path.
That's my niece. She's been staying with me.
She comes from New York to spend a month with me every year.
It's one of my greatest pleasures.
Unhappily for me, she can't stay longer.
After a month she finds the quiet deafening. Oh, Uncle Phillip.
Hello, old boy.
Uncle Phillip, what do you think happened?
You didn't know we had a guest.
You turned your back and see what happens.
My niece, Patricia Martin, Mr. Mason.
How do you do?
Uncle Phillip, there was a car full of detectives down the road.
They wanted to know the way to town.
They're searching for a man that got away from them.
It was on all the radios and everything.
They said he's a really dangerous criminal. He...
My dear, the police are always on the alarmist side.
But they said this man is really dangerous.
I'm sure they did.
How could they be heroes if he were harmless?
Pat, dear, would you mind not having any further quotations from the police?
Their remarks are always so expected.
They kill conversation.
You've probably seen the face of my niece before, Mr. Mason.
Why, yes. I was wondering where I'd seen...
As a matter of fact, you've seen her practically everywhere.
I'm told that billboards she adorns would reach across the continent, if placed end to end.
But I can't imagine who's going to place them end to end, nor why they should consider it the thing to do.
Uncle Phillip never has really been enthusiastic over my career as a model.
Oh, well, relatives are like that.
My, aren't you two mean, going ahead and eating without me.
I'm starving. Would you pass me one of those plates, please, Mr. Mason?
Oh! What's the matter, Pat? Have you just seen his handcuffs?
I heard them as soon as he came in.
Uncle Phillip, he must be the man they're looking for!
Yes, very probably.
But you should have given him to the police.
Are you frightened, Pat? Is that what makes you so cruel?
But you've got to! He's a dangerous man.
Oh, Pat, come on.
Mr. Mason may be many things, but he's certainly not dangerous. In fact, I'm not at all convinced that he's guilty.
Uncle Phillip, it's your duty as an American citizen.
It is my duty as an American citizen to believe a man innocent until he's been proved guilty.
Pat, don't tell me about my duty.
It makes you sound so stuffy.
Besides, I have my own ideas about my duties as a citizen.
They sometimes involve disregarding the law.
But what are you going to do? What are you going to do with him?
I'm going to turn him over to you, my dear.
And you're going to drive him down to Tim, the blacksmith, and have those preposterous contraptions removed from his wrists.
Oh, Uncle Phillip, how could I do a thing like that?
Because, you know, I can see a great deal farther than you can.
I can see intangible things. For example, innocence.
Will you go with my niece, Mr. Mason?
Oh, yes, sir! If you don't mind?
But what'll I tell the blacksmith?
Tell him Mr. Mason is my friend and my guest.
He won't ask any other questions.
Go ahead, Pat. Go with her, Barry.
Barry, I know, is your name.
Your voice explained to me that Mason isn't.
But as I told you before, names are of such little importance.
I don't know how to thank you, Mr. Martin.
Go ahead, Barry.
Go ahead. And do the things I wish I could do.
Good luck, Barry, and for heaven's sake, get back in practice on that triangle!
Is the blacksmith's shop very far?
Not very, right along here. And is he...
Is he really all right?
He and my uncle are great friends. Oh.
I guess he's all right, then.
You needn't worry. He's all right.
He's a darling blacksmith.
Only I'm not quite sure how much experience he's had with handcuffs.
Do you mind if I see them? I wonder what he'll have to do to get them off.
I can't quite see.
Could you hold them a little nearer?
Now I feel better.
I'll bet you do.
I'll bet this just makes you feel great, doesn't it?
In case you're interested, the blacksmith's shop is two miles back.
We're on our way to the police.
Your uncle's certainly gonna be proud of you!
The world isn't full of kind old gentlemen, like my uncle.
You're gonna find that out. Even my uncle wouldn't have been so kind if he'd known more about you.
All right, go ahead.
What did I do? I'd be kind of happy to know.
If it had been any other sort of crime, if a man had stolen because he was starving, even if a man committed murder to defend himself, maybe I wouldn't tell the police.
But there's only one reason why a man commits sabotage.
That's worse than murder.
Surprise for you, Miss Martin, I agree with every word you say.
Please don't talk to me anymore.
That will be my pleasure.
Well! I'll see that she doesn't!
Never try driving this way. It hurts.
I'm stopping the first car I see.
Help! Come on.
I can't get along without you. Let go of me!
Help! Help! Get the police!
Help!
My, they must be terribly in love.
Looks as though this car has been overheated.
Fan's broken.
I'm cold.
Yeah, I know. And you're hungry.
Now mostly I'm cold.
Look, if you'd stop trying to be a hero and decide to be on my side, maybe we could do something about your being cold.
Build a fire?
No, I wasn't exactly thinking of that.
Well, I didn't want to insult you by not even trying.
What do you want to turn me in for?
Haven't you got your picture stuck up in enough places now?
I just want to do my duty.
That's hard for you to understand.
Why won't you believe I'm all right?
'Cause you still don't make sense.
If you really hadn't done it, you would've gone to the police.
I've told you it's a question of time!
If I go to the police, it'd take me weeks to convince them.
If they're as dumb as you are, it'll take me months.
Do you think we're very far from Soda City?
I don't know. We'll ask at the next town, if there's a next town.
Well, anyway, I don't believe that part about Tobin.
You don't believe it because he's got a big ranch and a beautiful pool and...
No. It's just hard to believe that about any American.
Well, you believe it about me!
Well, you're different. You look like a saboteur.
You have a saboteur's disposition.
Don't tell me you've decided to be on my side.
No, I'm cold.
Say, aren't you wasting your very valuable time, sitting up here admiring the scenery?
Hey, look at that.
Looks like we've got company.
What do you suppose all that's doing way up here?
They aren't moving very fast, are they?
You know what we can do?
Oh, no, you won't.
Sorry, honey, I can't take a chance.
You're right. I'd turn you in at the first opportunity I get.
Let go of me! Let me go! Ouch!
Help! Help!
Won't you give me one break?
Won't you wait till we get to Soda City?
All right. I'm sorry I've got to leave you here alone.
But I told you what I've got to do, and I'm gonna do it.
There's only one thing I want to warn you about, snakes.
There're a lot of them out here.
Of course, there's only five or six poisonous kinds, but there are a lot of the long, squirmy, slippery, slimy ones.
Barry!
I'm coming up in the world. Now I'm better than the snakes.
Barry, please!
Are you with me? Yes, yes!
Now, what made you change your mind?
I can't turn you in if I'm stuck out there.
Oh, so that's it. Go back with the reptiles.
Let me go!
Who's there? You've got no right here!
Stop it and get off!
Now, now, Major. Ah, stowaways.
In the middle of this desert sea, we acquire two more vagabonds.
Bedouins like ourselves, eh, Esmeralda? Why, they're just a couple of kids.
Our car broke down a way back, and we walked for miles.
We saw your bus and hopped on.
We didn't want to wake you at this hour.
Broke down, eh?
We didn't pass no wrecks on the highway.
The whole thing sounds like a pack of lies.
You see, we were off on a side road.
I know. A moonlight night and a parked car. That's nice.
Oh, no, really, we were just...
Esmeralda! Everywhere you search for sex.
Get your eyes out of the mud and look up at the stars.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
My name is Bones. I am also known as the human skeleton.
How do you do? And this is Esmeralda, our bearded lady.
Naturally, we're very proud to have her as a member of our group.
You poor kids must be tired.
Come on in and sit down, have a little rest.
We're trying to get to a place called Soda City, a couple of hundred miles north, I think.
Well, then, you won't get there till morning, so make yourselves comfortable.
You must meet our other co-worker,
Tatania, our little human mountain.
A very great lady, indeed. How do you do?
What goes on there?
Oh, did we wake you, honey?
That's too bad. Oh, I was awake.
I wish you'd tell Mignonette to do something about that insomnia of hers.
I've been tossing and turning all night.
I wish you'd tell Marigold to shut her silly old face.
Are you girls not speaking to each other again?
Dear, dear.
Marigold's mad because I got her beau away from her back in the last town we played.
Kindly tell Mignonette I heard that last remark, that I wouldn't have the gentleman in question as a gift.
Nothing but a common novelty-seeker.
Girls, girls! What will our guests think?
Hey, he's cute!
You hear that? There she goes again.
Stop your squabbling.
They are tired. They've been walking for miles!
Nobody gave you a lift?
I know.
The normal are normally cold-hearted.
Stop gabbing and get these tramps off!
A cold heart, partly reduced in size.
I won't take no insults. Get them off. Aw, Major, honey...
Don't "honey" me! I've got a contract.
It provides for safe transportation, and it don't say nothing about picking up hobos.
That's the police, all right.
They must be looking for somebody.
Who could they want?
Me, I guess.
Oh! The carefree youth, and he has handcuffs on.
What do they want you for?
For something somebody else did.
I don't believe he's done anything wrong!
I'll go to bat for him anytime.
I've always told Mignonette she'd get mixed up with the police if she wasn't careful.
They're starting to search at the front.
Well, what are you waiting for? Hand him over to the police.
He's perfectly right.
He's a little stinker.
Seems like a terrible thing to do, but it'd be terrible, too, if we got into trouble...
All right, Bones, call the cops!
Just a minute, Major.
In this situation, I find a parallel for the present world predicament.
We stand defeated at the outset.
You, Esmeralda, have sympathy, and yet you're willing to remain passive and let the inevitable happen.
I have a belief, and yet I'm tempted to let myself be over-ridden by force.
The rest of you, with the exception of this malignant jerk, are ignorant of the facts, and, therefore, confused.
Thank heaven we're still members of a democracy.
We'll put the matter to a vote. No vote.
I'm against voting!
Fascist!
You know how we stand so far.
The twins, as usual, are on opposite sides, and so their votes pair.
Tatania's on both sides at once and therefore neutral.
The Major is for delivering these young people to the police, and I, frankly, am against it.
Esmeralda, the decision is up to you.
Well, I don't want any trouble any more than anybody else, but while you've been talking, I've been looking at something, something pretty fine, too.
I've been looking at that little girl there standing right beside that poor young man.
Never a word. Never a question.
Taking everything he's had to take, stringing along with him, whatever happens.
And I've been thinking, it's the good people that stick when anybody's in trouble, and there aren't many good people in the world.
I think that we, all of us, know that better than most.
And, well, it isn't something you see every day of the week, so I vote...
We don't give them up.
Good girl, Esmeralda.
This is subversive! I won't stand for it!
Oh, no, you don't, cuddles! You'll abide by the will of the majority.
Back into your places and pretend to be asleep.
That's all you have to do.
Here, honey, you sit right down here. Come on, young man, we've got to hide you. Turn all the lights off.
Here. Take off your coat and put this on.
Come on. Wake up in there!
Hey, what is this? Halloween?
Police.
Oh, is that so?
Haven't you got anything better to do than waking up law-abiding citizens in the middle of the night?
We're looking for a young man and his woman companion.
He's got dark hair, between the age of 20 and 25.
The dame's supposed to be good-looking. Have you seen them?
Now, where would I see anybody as normal as that?
Who's this? Doesn't look like one of your troop.
Sure, she's one of us.
She's our little snake charmer.
Right now she's sitting on a box of snakes so they don't get lonesome.
Can you imagine that? And a good-looking gal, too.
Well, I guess you can all go back to sleep now.
A snake charmer! Well, well. You never can tell about women.
It's all right. You can come out now.
Wait, justice, come back!
Sit down here! We're on our way.
I don't know how I can thank you, sir.
It's all right, my boy.
It gives you a good feeling when you can help somebody.
You people have a right to know what this is all about.
It's all right, son. If that little girl of yours can trust you, I guess we can. The baby!
She's had a tough time. Poor little girl.
She's worn out.
I'll take care of her.
Come on. Let's go.
Better let the snakes get some sleep.
They have to look good tomorrow.
I'm sorry.
What for?
For being such a dope. I was scared.
You'd have been a dope if you hadn't been scared.
You're tired, that's all that's the matter with you.
Get some sleep. You'll be fine.
I can go to sleep, all right.
I'm so tired.
I want to tell you something.
I believe you.
Do you, Pat?
You didn't, you know.
It's a free country.
A girl can change her mind, can't she? Sure, she can.
Thank you, Pat.
They made me so ashamed.
They're so nice and trusting.
They're wonderful people, all except that nasty little Major and the mean twin.
I don't suppose you can really blame the fat lady though, when a woman has lost her figure that way.
Welcome to Soda City.
The heart of the bicarbonate belt.
Well, we might as well do the town.
There's nothing here. Come on.
I suppose we are a little late.
I'm sorry, darling. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
I'm not complaining.
This is great, isn't it?
Solution to all my problems.
I was counting on this place.
A dump like this, 5,000 miles from nowhere.
Look at this. It's been in use.
Let's go around to the window.
Careful! Don't cut yourself.
Hello? Hello?
Hung up. What sort of phone is that?
It's a field telephone.
Well, a room with a view.
What do you suppose they cut that for?
I don't know.
Say, look.
Tripod.
Looks like it's the right height.
Yeah. Something else goes with this.
There!
That's it.
See anything?
Not yet.
Let me see!
Why, that's a...
We better put this away. Take that.
Say! The wood.
What about it?
They wouldn't burn that in a stove.
Why not?
The smoke would show.
That's a car. You better hide.
No, not here.
What do you think you're doing around here?
Hiya. I was wondering when you'd get here.
Where are you from? What are you sniffing around here for? Excuse me.
Funny, you knowing about this place. I don't quite get it.
You might have thought it over more carefully.
Your coming here doesn't help us a bit.
The heat's on this guy and he shows up here.
Tobin sent me.
The old man must be off his nut sending him up here.
Be a little more careful, Neilson.
Your criticisms in front of other people. Yeah.
Don't talk that way about the old guy.
I'll watch out for myself, Doc.
Me, too. Don't forget about me. That's why Tobin sent me up here.
He said you'd know how to take care of me. I guess that makes it pretty clear, Neilson.
I don't know.
A guy walks in out of the desert, and right away I get orders.
It ain't so clear to me.
I'm a little better than a stranger, friend, if you'll remember my press clippings.
Yes. Mr. Kane has done pretty well down South.
His accomplishments can't be disregarded, at least I hope not.
A man that has served as well as he has is entitled at least to recognition.
I'm entitled to more than that. Protection, too.
You guys have got to take care of me. I'm sure the firm will do its best.
They're known to be quite loyal to their employees.
Neilson will see to it that the firm's record is maintained.
You got it easy, you guys from back East.
You give orders. You do that, all right.
The big boys with the desk jobs.
All you got to do is reach for a telephone, sit back in a big leather chair, and us guys out here have got to take the rap.
You know, I think I'll go back East and work for a while.
You're not a very good example of loyalty to the firm. Yeah?
Well, I'm getting just a little bit tired, see.
So am I! I'm getting tired of all this talk.
Let's get going! The trip up here was no pushover.
I had to hoof it most of the way.
I got no place to hide you out. That ain't my line.
That ain't your line, huh?
What about you? You don't seem so interested, either!
Or I suppose you're just the big brains!
Or maybe you take a chance now and then just for laughs. Or maybe it doesn't work that way.
Maybe I'm the only guy that sticks his neck out.
Well, get this, both of you!
I pulled a big job and they're after me.
And you guys are gonna take care of me and do it right, or you're gonna have trouble on your hands.
I've got to get out of this part of the country!
The ground's burning up under my feet!
I've got to get back East!
It's a little more crowded back there. A guy doesn't stand out like he does here.
Hey, take it easy. Hang on to your nerve.
I've been hanging on to my nerves! I've been hanging on long enough!
I understand your difficulties.
I'm sorry about all the talk. But in this business, we always have to make sure.
I think I know him now.
I'm driving back East, you know. You'd better come with me.
All right, let's get going.
Get all the things together. After we leave, I want this place cleaned up.
You won't be coming back here.
Why not? You think they got the place spotted?
I'm making sure.
You'll have to find another place and store all this stuff.
Well, it's not gonna be easy.
It's your job. If you can't handle it, I'll have to get someone else.
All right.
I'll handle it.
You'll need some clothes.
Size 42. What'll we do about these? Hmm.
How did you manage to break them?
On an automobile fan.
That's very bright of you.
I think we can even take care of that, but let's get started now. Did you hear something?
Where does that lead to?
Just another room. The way out.
You see, we figure that Kane and the other fellows are probably heading for New York.
If there's anything I can do...
We sure appreciate that.
Why, anyone would have done the same thing.
That's right, this war sure makes a difference.
Everybody wants to get in and pitch.
Now, if you'll just give me your address in New York, Miss Martin, we can contact you back there.
Or maybe you could wire me about which plane you're taking.
We may want to get a hold of you fast.
Well, I can do that when I get back to my uncle.
Okay, Miss Martin, just keep in touch. I'm glad we came this way.
It adds a few miles to our trip, but somehow I've become a little sentimental.
I want to take a last look at it.
Beautiful, isn't it?
A great monument to man's unceasing industry and his stubborn faith in the future.
You'll be moving along soon.
Are you carrying any cameras or firearms at all?
Nothing at all, Officer.
You, sir? No, sir.
They must get a lot of power from this dam.
I think it supplies about 75% for the Los Angeles district, naturally including most of the power for the defense plants there.
Well, do you think there's any... Do you know Tobin very well?
No, not very well. I met him just that once at his ranch.
Did he have the child with him?
His grandchild? Yes. He seemed to be very fond of her.
That's one of the things I like about old Tobin, his love for that little girl.
Evidence of a good heart. I have children, too, you know.
Oh? Two boys. Nice little fellows.
Aged two and four. The four-year-old is naughty at times.
He's quite a problem. We get him a new toy and within half an hour it's smashed to bits.
And then, sometimes, after it's all over, he seems almost sorry.
Sometimes I wish my younger child had been a girl.
In fact, my wife and I often argue over a little idiosyncrasy I have.
I don't want his hair cut short until he's much older.
Do you think it'd be bad for him? Well, I don't know, it might be.
When I was a child, I had long golden curls.
People used to stop on the street to admire me. Things are different nowadays. If you gave the kid a haircut, it might save him a lot of grief.
Ah, we're on our way.

Drive to 401 instead of the office. Okay.
Anything wrong?
Plenty. I've just called the office.
They've disconnected the phone.
Same old phone company. Should have paid the bill.
This is no time for jokes.
They're watching the office. The disconnected phone, it's our signal.
You think they're watching for me?
I don't know. Who'd know you were in New York?
Oh, yeah. I guess you're right.
How about Brooklyn tomorrow?
Do you want me on the job? When are you going to learn to keep your mouth shut?
Sorry.
I thought he was in on it.
Shut up! It's all right. I'm good at keeping secrets.
Let's go.
Good evening, Mr. Freeman.
Hi, Mr. Freeman. Hello.
Ah, pleased to see you, Mr. Freeman. Have a good trip?
Yes.
Thank you, Robert. Madam is upstairs. She's waiting anxiously for you.
Oh, thank you, Robert. We'll go right up. This way.
Who's that?
Hey, is this a hotel? What's the festivity?
It's for a very worthy cause.
Mrs. Sutton often gives her house over to charity affairs.
She's a very generous woman.
I have an idea she isn't going to be really pleased to see us on a night like this.
Idiots, all of you. Stupid, inefficient idiots.
Everything is left to me.
I have to hover over all of you like an old hen.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sutton. The guests downstairs expect me to put in an appearance.
After all, as you say, they want something for their $25!
I will not have my benevolence abused.
My life, my position, they're important to me.
I'll do my best, Mrs. Sutton.
I only wish your best were a little better. Oh.
Mr. Freeman, I'm glad you've come at this time.
I was just telling Edward...
Is this the young man? Must you bring him here, as well? I certainly can't furnish him with sanctuary.
This house is full of guests, important people!
Don't you understand my position, Mr. Freeman, with this young man here?
The police are already watching your office.
Thank goodness they'll never come here.
But a little more of your stupid behavior and even the respectability of my house won't shield you.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sutton.
We can't leave any loose ends. All right!
All right! But for heaven's sake, stop playing the conspirator.
Now tell me all you know about the girl or ask him.
Why didn't you tell me about the young lady back in Soda City?
Oh.
Well, I didn't think it was important.
She was just a girl, like anybody else. She picked me up, she was pretty.
I guess it was kind of risky. Well, there you are.
I'm so sorry to have exposed you to any risk.
What's she doing here?
You're surprised to see me again.
How did you get here?
It doesn't matter how she got here. The point is there was no reason to bring her here at all!
You see, Mr. Kane,
I just learned on the telephone at the gas station that she was most indiscreet after she left you at Soda City.
She went straight to the local sheriff, who, fortunately, happened to be a particularly good friend of ours.
Oh, don't waste time in explanations, Mr. Freeman.
You've got to get the girl out of this house, all of you.
I will not have my benevolence abused!
So you played smart. That's great. That's a big help to all of us.
No, I wasn't smart at all.
I haven't been smart for four days.
Even when I went to the sheriff I hesitated.
I hated to do anything that might get you into trouble.
Yeah, I sympathize. The mistake I made was not leaving you back there with the snakes!
You might have at least learned to rattle.
I was right about you in the first place.
Good evening, Mr. Kane.
I didn't know you were a bookworm.
You must let me choose something appropriate for you.
Something not too difficult for you to understand.
Let me see.
Here we are. This will do admirably.
Remarkable work. Somehow prophetic.
Why are you here, Charles? And what's all this nonsense about books?
I am a refugee.
I have at last joined that revolting group of world travelers.
One ultimately turns into the thing one despises most.
And whom have I to thank for it? You, Mr. Freeman.
The girl was allowed to escape unobserved.
She left Mr. Kane, went straight to her uncle.
And that charming old man went to the police.
As a result, a whole hoard of officers came to my house.
Luckily, I was leaving when they arrived.
And the others, the very loyal ones, well, they're paying for their loyalty.
How appalling! Your charming house.
I'm so sorry, Charles. It's rather lucky.
You might have been sorrier. And you might have been a little more efficient in this whole matter, Mr. Freeman!
What good is it going to do you to insult me?
We're in trouble now.
And so the most important thing is to make sure of everyone around us.
Of Mr. Kane?
I'm just not sure. I want to know that he's all right.
All right? What an understatement. He's much more than that!
He's noble and fine and pure.
And so he pays the penalty that the noble and the fine and the pure must pay in this world.
He's misjudged by everyone.
Why, even the police have a completely erroneous impression of him.
I can assure you that contrary to what is supposed and to what he may himself have told you, that young man is certainly not one of his country's enemies.
Charles, you're joking!
I mean exactly what I say.
Mr. Kane is definitely no part of our little organization.
Your protégé. Well, you've done splendidly.
You bring him here, you idiot.
Now what in heaven's name are we going to do with him?
That's a very appropriate question.
Not much we can do with him.
I made the mistake once of turning him over to the police.
That's even more impossible at the moment.
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do.
You see, the new law threatens all of us with the death penalty.
So, I'm afraid we'll have to apply the ancient axiom.
Tooth for a tooth. Kane for a Tobin.
Please don't discuss things of that sort here.
It's rather nauseating and quite out of place.
Oh, Charles, I'm frightened.
We must take all precaution.
Of course. We must also continue with our work.
It's too risky now. We're already abandoning the dam.
We must remain inactive for a while.
Inactive? You are utterly mistaken.
Once we do that, our organization is finished.
We must carry on at all costs.
What about tomorrow's work?
Tomorrow's work? You can't abandon that after all your preparations.
But, Charles, the risk... Is great. I know that.
Unfortunately, we will have to carry out our orders.
I am leaving for the Caribbean now.
My position here is more impossible than all of yours.
Of course I'm rather looking forward to Central America.
Havana will be very gay this season.
You know, somehow I've suddenly had enough of this country.
The war has made it grim.
You're leaving us here to face everything, and you'll be on a boat sailing along.
It all sounds idyllic. Oh, Charles, Charles, this whole thing, it's impossible.
It's panicky. I'm deeply sorry.
There you are, darling!
How unbecoming for a hostess to hide herself away.
Am I intruding? I am so sorry, but I just must kidnap Henrietta.
She'll be back.
I've had some trouble with these people. They're doing the catering and making rather a horrid mess of it.
Our boy will appear any minute with the caviar!
I assure you. I'll stake my reputation on it.
Don't be a fool! Get to the house phone.
How'd you get here?
They met me at the airport.
I thought they were the police, then they brought me here.
Wait a minute. No use trying the way I came in.
Let's walk right out through the front door! Might as well. Yes, sir.
We'll watch the back exit.
They won't get out.
No good. See the one on the other side? I met him on the way in.
He's one of them. We'll never get out that way.
What can they do to us?
Plenty. They'd grab us. We wouldn't have a chance.
But these people would see them do it.
Of course. And if anyone had a question, we're a couple of gatecrashers.
Barry, this is awful. It's like a bad dream.
All these people here.
Isn't there anyone we can trust?
Sure there is. All of them. Only which one?
Excuse me. This may sound sort of crazy.
In fact, I don't even know how to start.
But this whole house is a hotbed of spies and saboteurs.
I'm not being silly. I assure you. Even our hostess, Mrs. Sutton.
What's the matter with you, sir? You're drunk!
You're not even dressed.
What'd he say?
Oh, he thinks I'm drunk.
When I read in the papers what those Japs are doing...
Beat it out! Beat it out. Keep it natural.
Yeah, man. Stay in that pitch.
Pardon me. Did you pay $25 to get in here tonight?
No, not exactly. My boss gave me a ticket.
Why? I need your help very badly.
We're in the middle of the biggest bunch of fifth columnists in the country.
Are you kidding? What's the gag?
No, I'm on the level. This is it.
Aw, you're kidding.
We got a wag on the joint.
The guy's trying to rib me. Aw, sling him your curve. Beat it out, son.
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like to talk to you about something very important. What is it, Mr. Kane? You know it's hopeless.
Why don't you join Mr. Tobin upstairs for a little supper?
I'll show you the way.
Barry, before they get to us, go out and stop the music and tell them!
Honey, this is the Sutton mansion. I'm just a guy from Glendale, California, wanted by the police.
They'll grab me as soon as I open my mouth.
What are you gonna do?
We can't just stand here. I know where we'll be safe.
Barry, I'm scared.
It's so unreal, all these people dancing and having a good time.
Yeah. And when you try to warn them, they laugh at you.
They think you're drunk.
That gray-haired man you spoke to, he seemed like such an honest citizen. Hmm.
Just a friend of the family.
I guess the room's well sprinkled with them.
They're so smart. That's what frightens me.
Yeah, they're smart, that's because they're ruthless.
It's easy to win when you forget about the rules.
A man named Fry drops a wallet in California and we wind up here, you and me.
That's the only good part of it, I'm with you.
I wish it were somewhere else. The North Pole, I wouldn't care.
We might wind up there yet, too, chasing Fry over the old glacier!
Fry. He seems so small now. I'd forgotten about him.
So had I.
Well, we can't just go on dancing like it's Saturday night at The Palladium.
We can't just wait till they come and get us. What do you think they'll really do?
Oh, right now they're probably haggling over the price with Murder Incorporated.
Oh, Barry, please! Sorry, Pat.
I hate to be out of it now there's still so much to do.
If ever there was a time when staying alive was important, you heard what they said.
Something about a job they are going to do tomorrow in Brooklyn.
The Navy Yard. One of us has got to get out of here.
Maybe if I start something, you can make a break for it.
Well, what about you? You can't worry about me. We got to take a chance.
Oh, Barry, why couldn't I have met you 100 years ago on a beach somewhere?
Bathing suits looked awfully funny 100 years ago.
I'll bet you'd look beautiful, though.
Afraid we're not behaving very well.
What's the difference? We weren't invited anyway.
Pat, this moment belongs to me.
No matter what happens, they can never take it away from me.
Oh, pardon me. Do you mind?
Oh, excuse me. Would you care to dance?
Why, yes. Certainly.
Oh, you're really a much better dancer.
Thanks. Who was the man you were dancing with?
I have no idea. I never saw him before.
No, I mean the man that just left you.
I know. That's who I'm talking about.
I never saw him before in my life.
Oh, what a pity. That was lovely. I hope you will ask me again.
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
Well, young man, you seem to be enjoying yourself.
Charming party, isn't it?
Where is she?
You mean your young lady? I thought you were taking care of her.
Perhaps she has a headache and lying down somewhere.
Would you like to come with me and look for her?
Hold on.
Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen!
Your attention, please.
I have something to tell you.
Something you ought to know about this house and about your hostess.
I beg your pardon, sir, but before you go on,
I think you might like to take a look at the curtain on the balcony.
I'm not much of a public speaker, ladies and gentlemen, and some of you are probably wondering how I can tell you anything about your hostess that you don't already know.
Her graciousness, her kindness, her many charities.
Well, I want to tell you that you have a big surprise coming, ladies and gentlemen.
Tonight, in this house, for the benefit of this great cause for which she's already done so much, our hostess, Mrs. Sutton, is putting up for auction one of her most treasured possessions, one of the famous Sutton jewels.
Mrs. Sutton, would you kindly step forward?
Thank you.
Mr. Kane, the young lady is asking to see you.
Are you sure? I wouldn't keep her waiting if I were you, sir.
Yes.
Will someone please...
Admiral, how about you? Would you take over for me, please? Excuse me, please.
I'm wanted on the phone. Delighted, sir. Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I will entertain your bids for this beautiful bracelet, which has been donated by our hostess, Mrs. Sutton.
What am I bid? $1,000.
$1,000 has been bid.
Do I hear any more?
$1,500. $1,500 has been bid.
Do I hear?
$1,750.
$2,000. $2,000 has been bid for this beautiful bracelet.
Where is she?
You seem to have a soft spot for that young lady.
You can't afford to make yourself that vulnerable, not when you're out trying to save your country.
Why is it that you sneer every time you refer to this country?
You've done pretty well here. I don't get it.
No, you wouldn't. You're one of the ardent believers, the good American. Oh, there are millions like you.
People that plod along without asking questions.
I hate to use the word stupid, but it seems to be the only one that applies.
The great masses, the moron millions.
Well, there are a few of us who are unwilling to just troop along.
A few of us who are clever enough to see that there's much more to be done than just live small, complacent lives.
A few of us in America who desire a more profitable type of government.
When you think about it, Mr. Kane, the competence of totalitarian nations is much higher than ours.
They get things done. Yeah. They get things done.
They bomb cities, sink ships, torture and murder, so you and your friends can eat off a gold plate.
It's a great philosophy. I neither intend to be bombed nor sunk, Mr. Kane.
That's why I'm leaving now.
And if things don't go right for you, if we should win, then I'll come back.
Perhaps I can get what I want then, power.
I want that as much as you want your comfort, or your job, or that girl.
We all have different tastes, as you can see.
Only I'm willing to back my tastes with the necessary force.
You certainly make it sound smooth and easy. Well, that's a trick.
I know the results of that power you believe in.
It killed my friend, and it's killing thousands like him.
That's what you're aiming at.
But it doesn't bother you, I can see that.
Because you really hate all people.
Let me tell you something.
The last four, five days I've learned a lot.
I've met guys like you and I've met others, people that are helpful and eager to do the right thing, people that get a kick out of helping each other fight the bad guys.
Love and hate.
The world's choosing up sides.
I know who I'm with. And there are a lot of people on my side, millions of us in every country.
And we're not soft.
We're plenty strong. And we'll fight standing up on our two feet, and we'll win.
Remember that, Mr. Tobin.
We'll win, no matter what you guys do.
We'll win if it takes from now until the cows come home.
Mr. Kane, I think we've discussed the rights of man sufficiently.
I'm feeling a little tired. You must be, too.
Robert, do you think you can arrange for Mr. Kane to sleep somewhere tonight?
Yes, sir. Certainly, sir.
That's enough, Robert.
Very good, sir.
Think you can take care of this? Yes, sir.
Will that be all, sir? Yes, thank you.
It doesn't matter what arrangements we've made, to what trouble we've gone.
This whole job hangs on one thing, timing.
If the section of the slipway goes up before the actual moment of launching, then all our efforts have been wasted.
If you blow her too late, well, then you just scare the crowd.
Timing, timing, timing.
That button must not be pressed until the ship starts to move.
What arrangements have been made for getting out of there?
As soon as the camera cables are unhooked, this truck goes.
We got a fix at the gate to get through without failing.
Who's handling the camera near the slipway?
The wires to the explosives were laid last night. All I have to do is hook them up to the camera.
Too bad we have to lose a good camera.
Well, everything seems to be taken care of. I'll be waiting for you at the newsreel office. Good luck.
Have they gone? Yes.
How is she? Okay. She's having her breakfast.
Any trouble keeping her quiet?
No. I made a deal with her.
You see, she got tired of having that adhesive tape over her eyes and mouth.
Well, I hope we get rid of her soon.
I promised to take my kid sister to the Philharmonic.
Give me the key. There it is.
I'm sorry we couldn't keep you at the house last night, but Mrs. Sutton has a limited number of guest rooms, and I suppose Mr. Kane was first in line.
Where am I?
Oh, that's a trade secret.
I only hope it isn't too high for you here.
Mr. Kane's quarters are nearer the ground, but he's being well looked after, and, like you, is probably enjoying a hearty breakfast.
Whose place is that?
That's Mrs. Sutton's house. Oh, who's she?
Some rich dame.
Saw something in the paper about her doing things for charity.
Right here somewhere. Here.
What about tomorrow's work?
Tomorrow's work? You can't abandon that after all your preparations.
But, Charles, the risk... Is great. I know that.
Unfortunately, we will have to carry out our orders.
What's the time?
10:50. Thanks.
Brooklyn Navy Yard, quick!
How much? 15.
Got change? Yes.
Courtesy of the Navy Department, we are now able to take you to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where over a national hook-up we will endeavor to bring you a description of the actual launching ceremony of the Navy's capital ship, the USS Alaska.
And so without further ado, we switch you now to the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
Here we are at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
It's rather a windy autumn day, but still it's a pretty good day for a launching.
I guess any day is a good day for a launching in these times.
Our microphones are located in several key spots, so we'll be able to bring you...
What's holding us up? Traffic, buddy. What do you think?
Here. I'll walk. Okay.
Well, I guess the main speaker is about to begin.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am now turning you over to Bill Donnan, who is located on the actual platform.
Go ahead, Bill. This is Bill Donnan, ladies and gentlemen.
We're located up here on the platform, right below the bow of the great ship.
It towers over us like some enormous monster.
This platform on which we have...
Take me to the guy in charge!
Okay. I'll take care of this.
What do you want? Something's gonna happen at the launching, sabotage.
Where'd you get your information?
I can't say now.
There isn't time. What can I do?
We got to have a little more than that to go on. Better come in the office and talk to the chief.
I tell you there isn't time!
What do you expect me to do? Take me to the guy in charge of the launching.
No, you got to go through the office first.
That's all. Towley, 1050.
Very crowded at the moment with all kinds of Navy officers...
Wait here. ...and Navy personnel. I can see in the group to my left
Rear Admiral Pierce and Mrs. Pierce. It is Mrs. Pierce who will perform the actual bottle breaking today.
She is shaking hands with a great many people down there right now.
Just a second, ladies and gentlemen. I see Rear Admiral Pierce moving toward the microphone.
Yes. I think he's going to begin his speech now.
We'll switch you over to the speaker's microphone.
The launching of a ship in a time of war is always a solemn occasion.
Today, when our fleet is fighting on all the seven seas, this ceremony gains magnitude for it represents, for the American people, a victory.
Where'd that guy go? I don't know. He just stepped outside.
...by the strong, diligent of hands of American workmen.
Let us rejoice, then, at this moment.
Let us be confident working for this great country to show the world what America can do.
Our American soldiers, who are freely giving their lives, so that we in this country can live in decency, security and peace.
This is Bill Donnan again, ladies and gentlemen.
You've just heard Rear Admiral Pierce speaking from the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
His speech is being received with great applause...
Lock the back doors, quick!
I can handle this! Be ready to pull out as soon as she goes.
The naval officer is handing her a bottle of champagne that is tied somewhere above it.
The crowd is tense. It is indeed a solemn occasion.
I switch you over to our microphone near the bow of the ship so that you may hear the actual launching.
Now I can see that Mrs. Pierce is moving towards the bow of the ship.
I'll switch you over now to Mrs. Pierce.
In the name of the people of the United States,
I christen thee Alaska.
What's the trouble?
Don't know. An explosion somewhere.
George!
Everything okay?
No, give us a hand. We got a guy.
Better scatter. Go down the corridor and through the iron door.
It will take you to the music hall. We'll go this way.
You must go, go at once, before Henry catches you here.
See here, I thought you wanted to make the old boy jealous.
Not anymore. He's threatened to kill you on sight.
Oh, I say, you don't think he'd go that far, do you?
Of course he will.
Oh, will you go before it's too late, before he shoots you to death?
See here, are you trying to tell me Old Henry's got a gun, a real gun?
Oh!
What do you think this is?
I've caught you at last, you rat in the grass!
Stop that! Run, Wilbur, run! Before he gets your range!
I think I got it now. Get out before I shoot again!
Run, Wilbur, run!
Quick! It never touched me!
I'll get you this time.
My husband! He's shot!
I'll kill the rat if it's the last thing I do!
He was only kidding.
And I'm only kidding, too! Get out of here!
Get out of here! He's gone mad! Mad!
Get out! Get out! Not that way!
He'll kill you! Stop him! Help!
Murder! Help! Run, for heaven's sake!
There he goes!
He's the one you're after.
You're the one we're after. Come on!
I tell you, he's the one. He'll get away! Come on!
Downtown.
Whereabouts? Anywhere. Just keep going downtown.
May I have change for the telephone, please? Yes, ma'am.
Operator? Give me the FBI headquarters, please.
Federal Bureau of Investigation. Hold on, I'll put you through.
Make sure he doesn't leave by the next boat.
Talk to him, follow him. Do your best to keep him there until our men come along.
A girl says she thinks she's traced Fry to Bedloe Island.
She's crazy. He'd never go there. Where did you pick up Schultz last month?
In that museum, that modern art place.
And Renaldo? You caught him looking at the fish in the aquarium, didn't you?
Yeah, but the statue's a dead end.
That's why he's smart. You better get going.
Let me take him along in any case, just to make sure the girl hasn't made a mistake.
Burke, you're one of the most obstinate men I've ever met! Get going. Come on.
Pardon me. Could you tell me which is Brooklyn?
I've seen you before, haven't I?
Sure.
On that boat coming over.
What'd you ask me?
About Brooklyn, I was wondering where it was. I've heard so much about it.
Over there.
Where are you from?
New York. What are you handing me?
Oh, no. You see, I work in a store downtown.
Now, I never get a chance to get out.
I just sit around all day, and I never see anything.
So I said to myself, the first vacation I get,
I'm going to see the Statue of Liberty.
This must be a big moment for you, huh?
Oh, it is. And it means so much to us now.
Why, I was just reading here in this booklet.
Did you know this statue was given to us by the French?
Do you know what they had written on it?
"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses,
"yearning to breathe free,
"the wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
"Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me."
And just look at the French.
Isn't it sad? Yeah. Very sad.
Oh, it's such a beautiful statue.
I could just sit up here all day thinking about it. Couldn't you?
Some other day, maybe. Not right now.
Right now I got to catch that boat back.
You coming?
Well, there's another boat in 15 minutes.
Couldn't we wait?
All the people have gone, and we'd be alone, just you and me.
Sounds cozy.
But I...
I haven't got the time.
Oh, on a nice autumn day like this, you couldn't spare 15 minutes for me?
I don't like autumn.
You're not being very nice to a lonely girl.
You look as though you might be lonely, too. Yeah.
I got to catch that boat.
Fifteen minutes shouldn't make such a big difference, Mr. Fry.
Who are you?
Come on. Quit stalling.
Who are you? I think I told you. A working girl on her day off.
Don't kid me!
What are you doing here?
It's rather a long story, Mr. Fry.
It all started with an unknown blonde, an aircraft worker at a factory in Glendale, California.
I get it.
Little Miss Liberty, carrying the torch.
Why'd you follow me?
Why do you think? Take a look down there.
If you can't figure it out for yourself, they're coming for you.
Do you see him in this bunch? No. Barnes, you stay here and watch this end.
The rest of you fellows, come with me.
You two, watch that side.
I'm going up.
Barry! Pat, where is he?
He started down!
Are you sure? Yeah.
He's up here! Come on!
Come on, Fry!
I'll get your sleeve.
Don't you go over.
If you slip, that will be three gone. Quick!
Can you get a grip with your feet?
I can't.
Kane, I'm getting a rope! They're getting a rope.
Hold on, Fry. I'll clear you. I swear I will.
I'll clear you. Hurry up with the rope!
Tell them quick. The sleeve. Sleeve!
Kane!
Hey, you in or aren't ya?
Get out!
Get out!
Keep your dirty hands off me.
Ah!
You!
You and your cat!
Go on, beat it.
Look at my dress.
You oughta buy me a new one.
Beat it, I said!
Cheapskate!
Hello, mister.
Albert Baker?
Yes?
Come in, friend.
Come in.
Don't worry.
My secretary.
You've, uh, brought the money?
We're having coffee.
Try a cookie.
They're very good.
It's lucky they sent you today.
By tonight, this would've been on its way to Washington.
That would've been just too bad for your boss, wouldn't it?
Especially the little, uh, prescription?
I'm even willing to forgive your boss that nasty little word "blackmail. "
So then, here you are and...
the money, please.
They said he'd be alone.
Hi, mister.
Mister?
I dropped my ball.
Thanks.
It was very nicely handled, my boy.
I compliment you.
Taught Mr. Baker a lesson in morality, didn't you?
Ugly people, blackmailers.
Only one way to pay them off.
Won't you have a sundae?
I'll have my cut, Johnson.
I'm broke.
Here's your end.
No, I'm not through with that.
Oh, lovely.
Dainty but sculptured.
I'll bet you read palms.
I'm an expert.
How'd you guess?
I guessed.
Oh.
My client is most grateful.
He must have plenty of lettuce.
Who is he?
Oh, he's very shy.
I couldn't discuss him.
Say, Johnson, what is your line, anyway?
You're not a finger man.
I'm shy too.
Why, Mr. Gates!
My name is not Gates.
You mean, you're not Will Gates of Los Angeles?
I'm not.
I'm sorry.
So annoying.
Second time today.
Peppermint?
They're all 10s.
You didn't expect a thousand ones, did you?
Don't you trust me?
Who trusts anybody?
Direct from the bank, as I promised.
Oh, I see your point, of course.
If the bills were bad, you couldn't very well complain to the police, could you?
I'm my own police.
What do you mean?
What would you do?
First I'd find out who you're stoogin' for... the shy boy.
Then I'd give him what I gave Baker.
Don't! I...
I can't stand violence.
Then I'd whittle off a little of that blubber.
Such a warped sense of humor.
Oh, I forgot.
A little gift from me.
Orchestra seats to the best show in town.
I oughta know.
It cost me plenty.
That's my one vice...
backing leg shows.
No, thanks.
Go ahead, take your girl.
You... must have a girl or a friend.
Why?
Live alone, work alone, eh?
Raven, how do you feel when you're doing... this?
I feel fine.
Well... be good.
Lieutenant Crane?
Yeah?
I'm Willard Gates, Nitro Chemical Corporation of Los Angeles.
My firm wants to know what the police up here are doing, if anything, about the man who robbed our paymaster.
They're working on it.
He's been reported here in San Francisco.
Don't they know that?
Yes, of course they know it.
That's why I'm on the case.
I'm from the Los Angeles force, up here on my vacation until this happened.
Well, I hope you can get some results.
It's been a week since the robbery.
The stolen bills are all new and all 10s.
Why hasn't an arrest been made?
I'll tell you why.
The man may not even be here.
All we can do is wait for him to pass one of those hot bills.
If he does that, we've got him.
I hope so.
You know we're offering a reward?
Yeah.
5,000 for a 20,000 bundle.
It's kind of unusual.
Is it?
Well, it's just because... the president of our company is so upset over it.
Well, it's his dough.
Remember we want him, dead or alive... preferably the former after what he did to our paymaster.
And quickly, too, or we'll go higher up.
Go milk a duck!
Five thousand dollars.
Mmm.
I could buy myself a farm, get a couple chickens and lay my own eggs.
That's a neat trick if you can do it.
Thanks.
All right, Miss Graham.
This is the gal.
Have you ever seen the love lights
In a lady's eyes
And then suddenly watch it vanish away
If there's trouble in your love life
Well, my friend get wise
For as we magicians would say
Now you see it
Now you don't
It goes hocus-pocus Alagazam
That's love
Try to kiss her
First she won't
And then presto, chango fiddle-dee-dee
You're hand in glove
One moment she's making you see
Canaries in the air
Next moment instead of her heart
The ace of spades is there
Now you see it
Now you don't
Because hocus-pocus Lo and behold
You get blinded by that moon of bright gold above
That's love
Now you see it
Now you don't
Because hocus-pocus Lo and behold
You get blinded by that moon of bright gold above
That's love
Thank you, McGillicuddy.
How ya been?
She's terrific.
Caught her act in St. Louis.
Yes, very clever and very attractive.
She's audience-proof.
Gets 'em bug-eyed.
Her fishing number's even better.
Fit right into your Neptune Club.
What do you say?
By all means.
Oh, Miss Graham!
You're hired.
Rehearse in Los Angeles tomorrow morning.
He'll do the talkin'.
I'm Willard Gates.
I own the Neptune Club.
There isn't a producer on the coast who doesn't know that I'm the perfect sucker.
Your act is very charming.
Thank you.
I wonder if we two might have dinner together tomorrow night in Los Angeles.
McGillicuddy?
My manager says no.
I don't like your manager.
Well, I don't always take his advice.
And people ask me why I back shows.
Thank you, Mr. Fletcher, very much for digging her up.
For 10%, I'd dig up my wife's mother.
Well, uh, tomorrow night then.
How was I?
Okay.
He's hooked.
Come on, change your duds.
We're late.
Why don't you tell me what this is all about?
Talk takes time.
Hurry up.
I'll be right back.
If this is a snatch, don't take me over the state line.
Miss Graham, Senator Burnett.
Senator?
So you're the mystery.
No mystery about me.
Just a hick lawyer the voters got stuck with.
- Miss Graham get the job?
- Yeah, and I think Gates is hooked.
I shouldn't wonder.
I am too.
Now, Senator, I have a boyfriend.
And she don't mean me.
Well, good-bye.
Do senators usually have conferences in automobiles?
Hotels have walls and walls sometimes have Dictaphones.
Oh.
Know about my committee?
Read the papers?
Mm, movie columns, gossip columns, football.
How about your history books?
Remember Benedict Arnold?
Sure.
The first all-American heel.
There's a handful of those heels in this country today.
And they're powerful enough to sabotage our defense.
We're trying to expose them.
It's okay by me.
My committee thinks Gates is one of them.
Him?
The nightclub angel?
In the daytime, he's an executive at Nitro Chemical.
In between times, he's been seeing men... that are suspected of being foreign agents.
Yet our investigators can't turn up anything definite.
- And that's where I come in?
- Will you give it a try?
Well, it isn't exactly like deciding to go to a beauty parlor.
But if you go through with this, you can't tell anybody, not even him. Ooh.
Worried about the boyfriend?
I don't know what he'll think when he sees me with four other fellas.
I don't either.
What do I do?
Can I show you somethin'?
How much?
$8.98.
Isn't it beautiful?
It's one of our best numbers.
What size you lookin' for?
I've got all si...
A girl named Annie will be down for it.
Give her the change.
Mama.
Mama!
Mama, I just made a sale.
The dress in the window to a man!
Can you imagine?
That dress?
Hey, Mama.
Mama, the number.
Oh, Mama.
I feel sick.
Are you sure?
Look.
Come on!
Come on, folks!
I'll be about five minutes.
If you need me, honk.
Right.
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Over here.
Step up!
Play the scale.
Eight shots, 10 cents.
Win a carton of cigarettes.
Come on, step up!
Hi, angel cake.
Hello, Michael.
Got some good news for you, sugar.
Me too.
Hello, Slukey my friend.
You're no friend of mine.
Go on, take the cigarettes.
Why bother to shoot?
What a beefer!
I've only been coming here once every other day.
That's twice too occasional.
Load for me, sugar, and start with your news.
You don't know it, but I'm in a big rush.
What do you mean, rush?
Our date's for the whole afternoon.
It was.
That's my good news.
Vacation's over and I'm on a case.
Don't you get it?
I don't have to go back to Los Angeles yet.
You're here.
Well, it's perfect.
Except for one thing.
I'm going to Los Angeles.
You missed!
Oh, I lived to see the day!
What for?
A job.
That was my good news.
I thought we'd be down there together.
How long you gonna be there?
I'm not sure yet.
I'm leaving tonight.
Look, sugar, what does it take to get you to darn my socks, cook my corned beef and cabbage... and sort of confine your magic to one place and one customer?
Oh, Michael, I would've died if you'd let me go away without saying something.
I want my guy.
I want a home, some kids.
Honey, you've got your guy.
But I understand kids take time.
...and the girl is expected at the store.
Detective Crane, proceed immediately.
Okay.
Do some magic.
Tell that horn to go away.
Go away, horn.
I didn't hear a thing.
I'm sorry.
I've gotta run, darling.
How 'bout it?
Say when.
Two bucks and the justice of the peace, huh?
Sunday?
But my job!
No, no, no, that's out now.
I can't quit on them.
Why not?
Just give them a week's notice starting last week.
Listen, darling, it isn't really the job.
It's something else.
I'll marry you the minute you get to Los Angeles, but it must be there.
Why?
I can't tell you why.
Well, this is a fine start!
Michael, listen!
One of the hot bills was passed in a dress shop.
We've got to get there quick.
The guy's girl's coming up.
I've gotta leave, darling.
Come on.
Michael,
I'm leaving on the 7:00 Southern Pacific.
Please come.
If I can.
He's acted funny ever since he came here.
He don't talk to nobody, he don't look at nobody.
Like he's got a secret.
I haven't looked up his record yet, but I wouldn't doubt it.
The girl ain't lying';
His name is Raven.
Is he in now?
I think so, Officer.
What do you know about him?
I can tell you.
He's no good.
You took a present from him, didn't you?
It wasn't a present.
He tore my dress, that's why.
Anyway, I was gonna sell it back and take the money.
How'd he happen to tear your dress?
All I did was chase his cat out of the room.
And you know what?
Just for that, he hits me right in the face.
He treats everybody like that.
What's his room number?
Room 9.
Here.
Here's a key.
Okay.
And you, don't leave.
When I can see him in handcuffs?
Don't worry.
I'm going up to his room.
Wait here.
Annie, my wife would never forgive me.
She'd have triple fits if she missed this.
I'll call home, and you try her at Sissie's.
Okay.
Don't put in that nickel.
Lift the receiver.
Dial.
Pretend you're talkin' to the old lady.
Say, " Hello, Mrs. Stewart.
" Hello, Mrs. Stewart.
Louder so the cop can hear ya.
Tell her what's up.
They're after Mr. Raven.
Why?
Because he passed a stolen bill in a dress shop.
What do you mean, stolen?
You oughta know.
Talk into the phone.
Yes, Mrs. Stewart.
The dress shop had the number from the police department.
Gates.
Stolen from where?
I don't know, Mrs. Stewart.
You do know.
I don't remember, Mrs. Stewart.
You better remember!
I gave you a dress, didn't I?
Yeah.
It could've landed me in jail.
Shut up!
He's not there.
Phone headquarters, Charlie.
Oh, that phone's busy.
There's one in my office.
Annie, did you get my wife?
I'm tellin' her now it's no use to come over.
That's right.
Say, I know something that'll help you.
His left wrist, it was badly broken.
The bone is big.
He never smiles, neither.
I wouldn't keep him, only he pays.
I'm respectable.
Hmm.
Well, don't touch his room.
We want fingerprints.
I'm going to put a man in the alley.
If Raven comes in, go to the window and give it this with the shade.
Huh?
Raise it and lower it.
Oh.
Okay, sir.
I'll cooperate.
I'm respectable.
I heard you the first time.
Annie, what are you gabbin' about?
And what's happened to that light in there?
Get back!
I oughta plug the both of ya.
Stay in there and keep quiet.
Hey, wait a minute.
You're under arrest.
What?
You're under arrest!
Southern Pacific.
Stay with that cab.
Yes, sir.
Compartment C, car 189.
Through to Los Angeles.
Thank you.
'Board!
'Board.
Michael!
Hey, Michael!
Oh, honey, I'm so glad you came.
Please say it's all right for me to go.
Gimme a kiss.
Hey, where's your magic?
Stop the train a minute.
Say it's all right.
Sure.
I just got a little hot under the collar.
You will hurry down, won't you?
Soon as I finish this job.
Why aren't you in a Pullman?
Did they chisel you out of a berth?
I took cash instead.
Why?
He has to go to college, doesn't he?
Who does?
Junior!
Oh!
Taken?
Are you that broke?
Come on.
I know you're not asleep.
You talkin' to me?
What do you want?
It was the only one I had, and one corner was torn off.
Don't make me call the conductor.
Hand it over and we'll forget it.
I'm no pickpocket.
Gotta find somebody in L.A. Short of cash, or I wouldn't have taken it.
Wanna borrow a dollar?
I'll get along.
Well, I hope your friend owes you something.
I owe him.
I don't get it.
If you're broke, how can you pay him?
I can pay him.
He's a fat man who likes peppermints.
You're gonna pay a debt with peppermints?
Yeah.
First I find out who his boss is.
Then I pay both of 'em, see?
I don't see.
That's all right.
Well, I'm turning in.
First call for breakfast!
First call for breakfast!
First call for breakfast!
First call for breakfast!
Morning.
You're sure this wire will reach Los Angeles ahead of the train?
Oh, yes, sir.
Uh, keep it.
Thank you very much.
Next stop, Los Angeles.
Let me see your left wrist.
Okay, thank you.
Wait a minute.
Lookin' for me for a job I didn't do, and they're not gonna get me.
You're gonna help.
Can we see your left wrist?
Can we see your left wrist?
Let me see that wrist.
Thank you.
Can we see your left wrist?
There won't be any shooting, will there?
That's up to him.
Can we see your left wrist?
Why, it's only me, boss.
Tommy, take these bags and don't let me out of your sight.
Don't worry, boss.
I'll be right here holding your hand.
All right, get goin'.
Can we see your left wrist?
Can we see your left wrist?
Let me see it.
They got him!
I tell ya I cut it.
I'm a machinist.
Yeah?
No, no, no!
You sure?
Of course I'm sure.
You've let him get away.
Easy.
He's still on that train.
Dig him out!
Well, you made it.
Sorry I can't have breakfast with you, but I've got a dress rehearsal.
You, uh, won't be needing the baby anymore, will you?
Good luck.
I got a job to do.
Nobody knows you're here.
Go ahead.
Somebody does know.
Keep walkin'.
Look, I...
In there.
Turn around.
Turn around!
Hey, what are you doin' in here?
Do you wanna get hurt?
We're tearing this dump down!
What's cookin' here?
Everything is prepared for the gas mask rehearsal, sir.
We're ready in the processing plant, sir.
At 8:00 tomorrow morning, everyone will be wearing a gas mask.
The same with packing and shipping, Mr. Brewster.
And my department, sir.
I didn't quite hear you, sir.
That's excellent.
Mr. Brewster says, "That's excellent. "
For their own protection, see to it that all my employees take this rehearsal seriously.
They're the only family I have.
That's all.
Mr. Brewster, I don't know how to quite tell you...
You're a bungling idiot, Gates!
I gave you a job to do involving millions and you botched it.
I didn't botch it, sir.
Here's Baker's letter and the formula.
Raven got those, and then you let him slip through your fat fingers.
Is that all?
As a matter of fact, I don't know whether they're working together or not, but there was a girl on the train with Raven.
You know anything about her?
She's... a performer I just hired for my nightclub.
Apparently you want to commit suicide.
I didn't know that when I hired her, and now I'm afraid to turn her over to the police.
They wouldn't believe anything Raven said, but they might believe her.
You're a fool!
Get down to that club of yours!
Uh, take her out somewhere.
F-Find out all about her.
And get out of here!
Yes, sir.
When you get to L.A., you're to see Mr. Brewster, president of Nitro Chemical Corporation.
Old King Chloride, huh?
Headquarters said you're to go straight to the plant.
Brewster is screaming because we didn't get Raven.
I'll see him. So long, kid.
Happy landings.
Hey.
Ellen!
They told me you were coming down.
How are you?
I don't know yet.
Where's the telephone?
Come on, I'll show you.
Pardon us.
What's the matter?
You look like you've been on a hayride with Dracula.
You're not kidding.
Long distance, please.
Who are you calling?
A cop.
On long distance?
My cop.
He's in...
San Francisco, please.
Person-to-person call, Lieutenant Michael Crane, police headquarters.
Say, what's this all about anyway?
Five thousand bank notes.
Places, girls!
Places!
Ruby, places!
See you later, honey. Come on, girls.
Hurry up, line up.
Yes?
He just left town.
No, couldn't tell you.
But...
- Miss Graham, please!
- Coming.
I've got you right where I wanted you
Dangling on my line
I've got you and I'm enjoying it fine
You had me right where you wanted me
That's the way I learned
You had me Ah, but the tables have turned
I was one out of 50 in your address book
Oh, what a spot you had me in
But today you're the sucker for the shiny hook
And you'll never wriggle off You can bet your bottom fin
That I've got you right where I wanted you
Dangling on my line
I've got you and I'm enjoying it fine
'Cause I'm not yours anymore
You're mine
'Cause I'm not yours
You're mine
Say, do you know anything about this Graham girl?
What's the matter?
Don't you like her act anymore?
Charming!
Break rehearsal for a few minutes.
I want to talk to her alone.
All right, girls.
Ten minute break.
How's Mr. Angel today?
Fine.
Fine.
Is our date still on?
I'll be with you the minute rehearsal is over.
Suppose we have dinner at my house in Hollywood?
I'll drive you back in time for the first show.
Peppermint?
Thanks.
I'll pick you up.
The Hotel Wilshire.
Right.
Oh, uh, I beg your pardon.
Hey, Walt!
That guy!
It's him!
Yes?
Will Gates?
He's in the shop.
I'll get him.
Yes?
Are you Will Gates?
What can I do for you?
Not a thing.
He's right in there.
Get back.
Yes?
Hello, Mr. Gates.
Did a man just come in here?
He had the wrong address.
I sent him around the corner.
Thanks.
Thanks, pal.
Now, don't worry.
We'll get him.
I do worry, Lieutenant.
Tell him, Mr. Collins.
The man's a maniac.
Why, he threatened to kill me if I gave the police his description.
Look what he did to me.
You see?
One of my oldest employees.
I want him protected.
We'll put a man with him night and day.
That's not enough.
This man Raven is a professional killer.
None of us is safe.
- When'd you find that out?
- This report came in 10 minutes ago.
Take it.
Read it.
Check on it.
My men are at your disposal.
Hmm.
Very interesting, Mr. Brewster.
Thank you.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
I am sure we understand each other.
And for the sake of my employees and your own men, this man Raven should be shot on sight.
Good day, Lieutenant.
Well, I...
Good day, Lieutenant!
This getup is giving me arthritis.
Do you know where this is?
Yes, indeed.
That's Hollywood...
way up in the hills.
You can hitch a ride if you're broke.
Thanks.
You know, when I was a little boy and the rain came down like that, my mother used to say, "God is angry at someone. "
He couldn't be angry at you, could he?
Mmm, I don't remember bending any commandments.
You know, you're a very intriguing girl.
I want to know all about you.
That's a big little word, "all. "
Well... practically all.
I looked for you on the train last night.
I thought we might be in the same car.
I tried the observation car, the diner, the Pullmans...
- I was in the chair car. - Oh, really?
Isn't that uncomfortable?
Not for an old trooper.
That is, of course, unless you're unlucky and your neighbor snores.
Were you... unlucky?
Oh, no!
I sat with a very charming old lady.
She told me about her farm in Iowa, how her grandmother came out in a covered wagon...
What's the matter?
So you do know him?
What are you talking about?
- You were with Raven on that train. I saw you!
- What have you to do with him?
He's after me and you're helping him.
He'll use that gun, the gun he used on Baker!
Why did you get mixed up in this?
I'm a peaceful man.
I hate violence.
But don't think I won't protect myself.
I don't understand it.
That girl's so nuts about you, I'm sick of hearing about it.
Now all of a sudden she rambles off with that fat wolf.
Why?
If I were you, lover, I'd scram right out there.
That girl's wrestling by now, or I'm no judge of character.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Never even scratched her.
We're a cinch.
In a couple of hours the bridge over the reservoir will be deserted.
Look... Don't tell me!
I don't want to know anything about it.
This is a work of art.
The ropes come off.
I tie sash weights to her ankles with soft catgut.
Please, that's a horrible word.
Now get the angle on this.
She disappears, two weeks, maybe three.
Then up she pops.
None of this stuff on her anymore. No marks.
A suicide.
Now, isn't that beautiful?
That's loathsome!
Be sure no one sees you. Don't worry.
I'll take the other car.
And when they find her...
Don't tell me!
Okay.
Between me and the reservoir.
I'll wait down at the Neptune 'til you come.
You're all upset over nothing, boss.
Eat a good dinner.
It'll calm you down.
Such a lovely body.
It's revolting!
That's a relief.
Come to the club as soon as possible.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, no, sir.
Miss Graham's been gone about two hours.
I thought she was having dinner here.
Not that I know of.
Mr. Gates go with her?
No, sir.
He just left a few minutes ago.
I'd like to use your phone.
Certainly, sir.
Excuse me.
It's right over there.
Thanks.
Here you are, sir.
This is Police Lieutenant Crane.
Give me the Hotel Wilshire right away, please.
Miss Ellen Graham.
Oh, she did?
What's the forwarding address?
Huh.
Thank you.
Do you know where Mr. Gates went?
No, sir.
But he generally has dinner at the Neptune Club.
Miss Graham is not in any trouble, is she?
Personal matter.
I see.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
All right, get 'em up.
In the back way.
Say, what is this?
Against that wall.
Now, where is she?
Oh, the girl?
Oh, she-she left.
Why'd you dump this, then?
Well, she was here, see, but...
Take it easy.
What's Gates got against you?
He saw us on the train.
He thinks I'm your girl.
How'd he catch up with you?
I work in his nightclub.
You got one of those dressing rooms, haven't you?
Mm-hmm.
Come on.
What for?
He's eating there tonight and I want to talk to him alone.
Look, I'm not gonna hurt you.
You treated me okay.
But you do what I tell you.
Come on.
All right, but you'll have to help me.
So you're a copper's girl.
Who told you that?
He was here lookin' for you, and he better stay away from me.
Have you tried her hotel?
They said she checked out.
Then I'm afraid I can't help you.
For you, sir. Oh.
Thank you.
Hello? No.
Yes!
He's got your car.
The girl's with him.
Get out of there fast, boss.
Watch that cop.
He's her boyfriend.
Uh, right.
Excuse me, uh... that was business.
I've got to leave.
I'll walk along with you.
We've got some more talking to do.
Good evening, sir.
Go straight to your dressing room.
Michael!
Ellen, where have you been?
Watch it, copper. It's Raven.
Do what he says.
You stay where you are.
There's a dragnet out for you, Raven.
It won't do you any good to hurt her, so use your head.
You better stay put.
Stop Gates!
Tell him to stay in town.
Where'd that couple go? What couple?
I didn't see anyone, sir.
Come here!
Get on that radio and tell them to round up every police car they can spare.
Cover this whole district.
Hey, Mike, I told Gates what you said, but...
Wait a minute.
Hey!
These are Ellen's!
She's blazing a trail for us.
Tell them to look for cards with these initials on 'em.
Right.
I've got to rest a minute.
It's the gas works.
We'll hide out inside until morning.
You stay up on top until I get there.
And don't try to run.
Who do you think I am?
Whirlaway?
Hey!
Here's one.
Meet us at the other end of this alley.
Hey, look at this.
If we go after him in the dark, somebody's gonna get hurt.
Ellen maybe.
But if we keep him cooped up until morning, then we can spot him easy.
Let's flood these walls with searchlights.
Yes, sir.
Steve, you and I will go after him alone.
Maybe I can talk him into the open.
Not him! I said "maybe.
" Give us a boost over.
Come on, boys, let's go.
I've been thinking about what you said.
We both took a beating from the same guy, didn't we?
Yeah.
I think I know where he'll be in the morning.
Where?
You've got to tell me something first.
I want to know what you've got against him.
I did a job for him.
He paid me off in hot money so he could put me where I couldn't talk.
What was the job?
Your turn now.
You haven't told me.
Your turn now.
He's at Nitro Chemical.
Thanks.
Get up on the catwalk.
Be careful of Ellen, but if he starts to blast, let him have it.
Raven!
I want to talk to you.
You're bottled up.
You can't get out.
We're moving in when it's daylight.
We don't want to shoot unless you make us, so come on out and talk it over.
Raven!
Do you hear me, Raven?
That cop of yours.
We've got to move again.
Hey, have you seen anything?
I've looked everywhere and I haven't seen a thing, sir.
Wait.
Get in there.
You're sure there's no place he can get out?
That must come out someplace.
Go on.
Where's this go?
To the railroad yards over there.
You stay here.
I'm gonna beat him to it!
Go ahead.
When you get on the new bridge, turn your searchlights into the yards.
When we spot that drainpipe, we've got him.
All right, step on it.
There's some sort of light ahead.
Keep goin'.
What's down there?
Looks like a railroad yards.
Look out.
Get on those searchlights.
Over to the right.
Turn the other one.
Right away, sir.
All right, turn around and drop down.
Some fun!
Keep every foot of the yard covered.
Yes, sir.
Swing the beam to the left. Lower.
Yes, sir.
Okay, we'll keep 'em here 'til morning.
Still bottled up.
Why don't you hop a rattler and get out of this?
I've got that job to do.
Come on, we'll find an empty.
Take it easy.
I've got a twisted ankle.
Hogan, take 15 men and stop every train going in or out.
You certainly pack an arsenal.
Something I took from Gates' chauffeur.
What happened?
Drain pipe wire.
You'll get dirt in it.
Have you got a handkerchief?
Forget it, will ya?
That's it, boys.
Cover the whole yard.
That's enough.
You're a funny guy.
You like my doing that, but you won't admit it.
That's sucker talk.
You killed Baker.
Gates told me.
Who's the man behind him?
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Maybe I can help.
You must have some idea who it is.
Baker was blackmailing the guy behind Gates.
He was going to send a letter about him to Washington.
I gave it to sweet-tooth.
What was in it?
Piece of paper with some kind of arithmetic on it.
A prescription he called it.
Like a chemical formula?
How do I know?
Was the letter going to Senator Burnett?
Huh?
Yeah, that was his name.
Hey, this is good luck.
Cats bring you luck.
And it's hungry.
Ain't got nothin' for you, Tuffy.
You like cats, don't you?
Yeah.
They're on their own.
They don't need anybody.
Well, this one could do with a friend.
So could you.
You're tryin' to make me go soft.
Well, you can save your oil.
I don't go soft for anybody.
I could put somebody else in charge.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't.
What about your girl?
That's just the point.
This guy's a killer, all right.
I've checked Brewster's information.
That's why I want to wait 'til morning and gas him out.
They'll move in in the morning.
Every flatfoot in town.
You know, I've been figuring something.
That chemical formula.
Yeah?
I bet I know what it is.
What?
Gas.
Poison gas.
They're selling it to our enemy.
So?
So tomorrow they'll ship it back in bombs.
Japanese breakfast food for America.
Did you hear what I said?
It's important.
This war is everybody's business.
Yours too.
Mr. Gates is still eating his peppermints.
That's my business.
Why don't you stop thinking about yourself for a minute?
Who else is gonna?
Hey, look out for that clothesline!
Some doings tonight.
A cop wherever you spit.
Yeah.
How'd you like to be worth 5,000 smackers dead or alive?
Wouldn't care for it dead.
Did you hear that?
That meowing?
Come on.
They don't pay off on cats.
Let it up.
They've gone.
Let it up.
It's dead.
I killed it.
I killed my luck.
You got the break, Tuffy.
I'd like to crawl down there with you and sleep.
Why don't you sleep for a while?
It's no good.
I'd only dream.
Every night I dream.
I read somewhere about a kind of doctor, a psycho-something.
If you tell your dream, you don't have to dream it anymore.
That's right.
You...
You wouldn't laugh if I told ya, would ya?
It's a woman.
I dream about a woman.
She used to beat me.
To whip the bad blood out of me, she said.
My old man was hanged.
My mother died right after that, and I went to live with that woman... my aunt.
She beat me from the time I was three 'til I was 14.
One day she... caught me reaching for a piece of chocolate.
She was saving it for a cake.
A crummy piece of chocolate.
She hit me... with a red-hot flatiron.
Smashed my wrist with it.
I grabbed a knife.
I let her have it... in the throat!
They stuck a label on me... killer.
They shoved me in a reform school, and they beat me there too!
But I'm glad I killed her.
What's the use?
There's nothing I can do.
There is something you can do.
Don't kill anymore.
You're just killing her all over again.
That's all you're doing.
You don't really want to get Gates.
What do you want me to do, send him some candy?
I want you to make him spill the whole works.
Who's behind him, names, everything.
I want a signed confession.
That's more important than killing him.
It's important to your country.
Come on, take your hands off of me.
Button up, will ya?
I'll take care of Gates my way.
No, please!
Get away from me.
Go on, get away.
Gonna wait for it to lift?
We'll have to.
It's thicker than gravy down there.
No chance for a getaway.
An eel couldn't get through.
We've got every foot covered.
They're waitin' for my whistle the minute it clears.
No soap, huh?
Too many of' em.
But I got a proposition for ya.
You still want that stuff from Gates?
Of course I do.
Help me outta here and I'll get it for you.
Or was that hot air last night, that flag-waving?
Come on, make up your mind.
Okay, I'll shoot it out with 'em.
I hope your copper gets the first slug.
No, wait a minute!
Promise me you won't use that anymore.
All right.
It's a deal.
You go first, across the yard.
Don't run or they'll know it's a woman.
Here, take this.
Wait 'til they spot you, then get under something.
Stall as long as you can, then come out with your hands up.
Now?
Let them go first.
Wait for the whistle.
We'll give it another minute.
You're gonna marry that copper?
Right guy for ya?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
All right, go ahead.
Look!
Spread out, but watch me.
Send Glennon up the embankment.
Right away, sir.
He's underneath there.
All right, boys, let's use the gas on him.
Chuck.
So old man Brewster was right.
She is Raven's girl, huh?
All right, Crane, I'll take over.
Drop it!
The other one.
You boys stick here.
Come on!
Hey, get outta there!
Ellen, you've got to tell me.
Where'd he go?
Mike?
He got Glennon.
Yeah?
Dead?
Yeah.
He promised me he wouldn't.
Where'd he go?
Now use your head!
That guy's a killer!
How did you meet him?
What were you doing with him?
I can't tell you.
This isn't a cop asking.
It's me.
He saved my life.
Where?
At Gates' house?
What was he doing there?
So that's who he's after.
He's headed for Nitro!
Well, so are we.
What's the matter?
Did I scare ya?
This is no time to be funny!
I'm sorry, boss.
Take it easy.
Did you see the rehearsal? It's started.
Yes, it gives me the shivers.
Any news from the police?
They're waiting for the fog to lift.
What's the matter with them?
It's lifted!
Then everything's okay.
I hope so.
But you stay out there in front of my door.
No visitors.
Leave it to me.
Will ya take it easy?
You only got one life.
Ladies and gentlemen, we will first visit the processing plant.
This way, please.
What?
When?
Raven's escaped!
He's coming here!
Phone the company police, and tell Tommy not to budge from that door.
Tommy?
Tommy!
Mr. Gates, Tommy isn't there.
Isn't there?
Well, f-find him!
Tommy, where have you been?
Mr. Gates wants you in his office.
Hurry!
Tommy, you're getting very lax.
Don't you realize that maniac could've walked right in here?
The old man wants to see me.
While I'm up there, get me a bottle of Scotch.
I need it.
This hot money too?
What?
Miss...
No, you don't.
I'm not to blame.
You wouldn't... kill an innocent man, would you?
It's all his fault.
I was acting as his agent.
Quiet.
We'll both see the old man.
Get up.
Come on.
Yes. Yes.
Tell Mr. Brewster he'll be right up.
Mr. Gates.
Hello, Tommy.
Have you heard about Raven?
He escaped from the railroad yards.
And Mr. Brewster is having a fit about it!
Well... what delayed ya?
What's the matter with ya?
Put that thing away.
That's him, huh?
What do you want?
My name's Raven.
Don't answer it.
What is that?
This button, it rings the alarm and opens the doors.
For 15 years!
Dressing you, nursing you, cleaning you, listening to your dirty deals.
Go ahead, wipe him out!
We got business to do.
Come on, give him that pad.
Can you get to that office from the roof?
No, sir.
Wait a minute.
There's a painter's scaffold up there.
- Come on!
- Who are you selling that gas to?
You look like a young man who knows a good thing.
Why don't you...
- Do what he says!
He'll kill you!
- Stop whining!
I'll tell you.
That new gas formula, he sold it to the highest bidder.
You've just committed suicide, Gates.
To the Japanese!
You know this stuff.
You write it, and he'll sign.
I will not sign it!
And don't you think I will, young man!
You'll sign.
Let her go.
There.
If you want any more, there's the medal for services rendered... from his boyfriends abroad!
H-How much do you want, Raven?
I'm a rich man.
Take that pen while you still got a chance.
Oh, h-h-how foolish young men are.
All right, you're next.
Oh, yes, yes, I'll sign.
Look out!
Dead.
His heart.
One final double-cross.
Believe me, it was Brewster!
There's something else.
You tried to kill that girl. No.
No!
That girl's my friend. She's not your friend.
She told the police.
- Shut up!
- They called me up!
- You're lying!
Why are they here?
She told them!
She...
So this was it.
You didn't tell the cops, did ya?
Did I do all right for you?
Oh, Michael, my darling, hold me.
Lubinski, Kubinski...
Lominski, Rozanski and Poznanski.
We're in Warsaw, the capital of Poland.
It's August, 1939. Europe is still at peace.
At the moment, life in Warsaw is going on as normally as ever.
But suddenly, something seems to have happened.
Are those Poles seeing a ghost?
Why does this car suddenly stop?
Everybody seems to be staring in one direction.
People seem to be frightened, even terrified.
Some flabbergasted.
Can it be true? It must be true. No doubt.
The man with the little mustache, Adolf Hitler.
Adolf Hitler in Warsaw when the two countries are still at peace... and all by himself?
He seems strangely unconcerned by all the excitement he's causing.
Is he by any chance interested in Mr. Maslowski's delicatessen?
That's impossible! He's a vegetarian.
And yet, he doesn't always stick to his diet.
Sometimes he swallows whole countries.
Does he want to eat up Poland, too?
Anyhow, how did he get here? What happened?
It all started in the General Headquarters of the Gestapo in Berlin.
Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler!
- Colonel, we have Wilhelm Coetze here.
If you'd like to look into his record.
- I hope he'll talk.
- He'd better.
- Send him in.
- Yes, sir.
Wilhelm Coetze!
Heil Hitler!
And now, Wilhelm, I understand you want a little tank to play with.
Yes, my father promised me one if I got a good report card.
But our Führer heard about your report card... and decided to give you just what you want.
Heil Hitler!
You are going to tell your father who gave it to you, aren't you, Wilhelm?
Sure, our Führer.
And then maybe he will like the Führer a little better, won't he?
Sure.
- He doesn't like him now, does he?
- No, he doesn't.
And sometimes he even says funny things about him, doesn't he?
Well, he said they named a brandy after Napoleon... and they made a herring out of Bismarck.
- And Hitler's going to end up as...
- A piece of cheese.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- How did you know?
- Well, it's a natural thought.
A natural thought?
I hope you don't misunderstand. I always, that is...
You see, Colonel, I hope you don't doubt my...
Heil Hitler!
The Führer.
Heil Hitler!
Heil myself.
That's not in the script.
- But, Mr. Dobosh, please.
- That's not in the script, Mr. Bronski.
- But it'll get a laugh.
- I don't want a laugh here.
How many times have I told you not to add any lines?
- I want...
- You want my opinion, Mr. Dobosh?
No, I don't want your opinion.
All right, then let me give you my reaction.
A laugh is nothing to be sneezed at.
Mr. Greenberg, I hired you as an actor, not as a writer.
Understand?
What does the script say?
- I make an entrance.
- And what do you say?
- Nothing.
- Then say nothing.
Here am I sitting, waiting for my scene, all eager to go... and I have to wait and wait to be driven out of my mood... just because two little actors in the cast want to enlarge their parts.
Mr. Rawitch, what you are, I wouldn't eat.
How dare you call me a ham!
Folks, I want everybody to understand this.
This is a serious play, a realistic drama...
- Good morning, Dobosh.
- Good morning.
- How do you like my dress? - Very good.
It is a document of Nazi...
Is that what you're wearing in the concentration camp?
- Don't you think it's pretty?
- That's it.
Well, why not? I think it's a tremendous contrast.
Think of me being flogged in the darkness.
I scream, the lights go on... and the audience sees me on the floor in this gorgeous dress.
- That's a terrific laugh.
- That's right, Greenberg.
You keep out of this!
That a great star, an artist, could be so inartistic.
You must be out of your mind.
What do you mean by talking to my wife like that? How dare you!
I'm sorry. I lost my temper.
Sweetheart, the dress stinks.
You're only afraid I'm running away with the scene.
I afraid? Why should I be?
Of course not. You're the best actor in the world.
- Everybody knows that, even you.
- Don't be a prima donna.
Any chance to take the spotlight away from me, it's ridiculous how you grab it.
Whenever I start a story, you finish it.
If I go on a diet, you lose the weight.
If I have a cold, you cough.
If we should ever have a baby, I'm not so sure I'd be the mother.
I'm satisfied to be the father.
Mr. Dobosh, look, if you'll just give me a chance...
- Who made you up?
- I did, Mr. Dobosh.
- What's wrong with it?
- I don't know. It's not convincing.
To me, he's just a man with a little mustache.
But so was Hitler.
Wait, it's not just the mustache. It's... I don't know.
- I just can't smell Hitler in him. - I can.
I know.
That picture. That's what he should look like.
But that picture was taken of me.
Then the picture's wrong, too.
Now, see here, Mr. Dobosh, I'm a nobody and I have to take a lot.
But I know I look like Hitler, and I'm going to prove it right now.
I'm going out on the street and see what happens.
And that's how Adolf Hitler came to Warsaw in August, 1939.
May I have your autograph, Mr. Bronski?
- Bronski?
- Why, certainly.
I know it would get a laugh.
Then Dobosh said to me, "Bronski, you're going to play Hitler."
I thought that was the real start of my career.
Don't worry, Bronski. They can't keep real talent down forever.
And the day will come when you'll play Shylock.
The Rialto scene.
Shakespeare must have thought of me when he wrote this.
"Have I not eyes? have I not hands...
"organs, senses, dimensions, affections, passions?
"fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons...
"subject to the same diseases.
"If you prick us, do we not bleed?
"if you tickle us, do we not laugh?
"if you poison us, do we not die?"
You'd move them to tears.
- Instead, I have to carry a spear.
- That's all we do, carry a spear.
Carry a spear in the first act, and in the second act.
Carry Rawitch off the scene in the last act.
How I'd love to drop that ham right in the center of the stage.
Would get a terrific laugh.
Hello, this is Mr. Tura.
Please order me a salami and cheese sandwich and a glass of beer.
Right away, please. Thank you.
- The audience is a little cool tonight.
- Not to me.
I know I'm giving a rotten performance.
I always do when we quarrel.
- Say something nice.
- You faker.
I watched your scene with Polonius.
You were never better.
I'd give you a kiss right now, but I'm afraid I'll ruin my makeup.
Darling, you were right this morning.
I felt so rotten after the rehearsal, I went to Dobosh and told him... when he advertises the new play to put your name first.
Did you, darling? That's sweet of you. But I really don't care.
That's what Dobosh said, so we left it as it was.
But, darling, you know how I feel about you.
Why I'd even...
- Flowers?
- Aren't they beautiful?
- Don't be casual. Who sent them? - I don't know.
There was no card. No card again?
That's three nights in succession.
I'm sure this has nothing to do with me personally.
This man probably loves theater, an art fanatic.
Someone sitting in the gallery night after night...
Just one of those poor boys who can't afford a ticket... but inherited a lot of flowers and is trying to get rid of them.
Three nights in a row.
Even Shakespeare couldn't see Hamlet three nights in succession.
- You forget you're playing Hamlet. - That's right.
Mr. Tura on stage!
Maria, darling, I'm going into my big scene.
Joseph, sweetheart, I swear I don't know who it is.
Thanks, darling.
It's true, Anna, I don't know who it is.
But I'm positive who it might be.
- You mean that young aviator?
- Yes, he's very young.
He's in the second row again. He gets better-looking every night.
Don't misunderstand me. I love my husband dearly, and why not?
He's wonderful.
Only he gets so unreasonable, so upset about little things.
Like the little thing in the second row.
Waiting for an answer.
Stanislav Sobinski." I was right, it is a young aviator.
- Is he suffering very much?
- Yes, he had to break his silence.
- He couldn't bear it any longer?
- No, he couldn't.
- Poor little thing.
- He's just a mere boy.
- Oh, no.
- What's he want you to do, adopt him?
He's dying to see me, even if it's just for a minute. Of course I won't.
Definitely not.
Yet, I don't like to be rude to him.
I think it's a mistake to ignore people who admire one and buy the tickets...
Darling, don't waste any more time with excuses.
If you want to see him, see him while he's still young.
Yes, I think I owe it to my public.
Dear Lieutenant...
Wait till you see him, Anna.
Unfortunately my time is completely taken up.
But if you insist on seeing me, come back to my dressing room... when Hamlet goes into his soliloquy, "To be or not to be."
- How does it sound?
- Safe.
"O heavy burden!"
"I hear him coming
"Let's withdraw, my lord."
"To be, or not to be:
"that is the question:
"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
"The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune...
"Or to take arms..."
Thank you, Mrs. Tura, for receiving me.
If you knew how I was looking forward to this moment...
- And now you're probably disappointed.
- Mrs. Tura.
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.
So you are the gentleman that sent me those lovely flowers. Thank you.
Somehow, I pictured you quite differently as a dignified old gentleman.
And now I see you...
I wonder if it was the right thing to ask you back here.
You see, I never see strangers in my dressing room.
But you are no stranger to me.
I've seen you in everything you've played.
I'll never forget how I laughed when I saw you as Kiki.
Some people thought I was funny.
But you certainly weren't funny when you played Lady Macbeth.
- Thank you.
- I was really scared of you that night.
Of poor little me? I wouldn't hurt a fly.
Or a goldfish. By the way, how is he?
- Who?
- The goldfish.
- What goldfish?
- The one you're so attached to.
You see, I read all your interviews.
Oh, yes, of course.
When I saw that picture of you at the farm, behind the plough...
- By the way, where was that?
- In The Chronicle.
No, I mean, where is the farm?
No, I think we've talked much too much about me.
Tell me about yourself.
There isn't much to tell. I just fly a bomber.
How perfectly thrilling.
I don't know about its being thrilling, but it's quite a bomber.
You may not believe it, but I can drop three tons of dynamite in two minutes.
- Really?
- Does that interest you?
It certainly does.
I don't want to overstep myself, but I'll take a chance.
Would you permit me to show you my plane?
- Maybe.
- When shall I call for you?
Tomorrow at 2:00 at my home.
No, I'd better meet you right at the airport.
Goodbye.
I hope you forgive me if I acted a little clumsy... but this is the first time I ever met an actress.
Lieutenant, this is the first time I've ever met a man... who could drop three tons of dynamite in two minutes.
Bye.
Tomorrow at 2:00, I'm gonna look down on Warsaw.
He's gonna take me up 10,000 feet in the air.
There's nothing wrong in that, is there?
No, not at all. As long as Tura doesn't find out.
After all, what a husband doesn't know won't hurt his wife.
It happened.
What every actor dreads.
What, darling?
Someone walked out on me.
Tell me, Maria, am I losing my grip?
Of course not, darling. I'm so sorry.
But he walked out on me.
Maybe he didn't feel well. Maybe he had to leave.
Maybe he had a sudden heart attack.
- I hope so.
- If he stayed, he might have died.
Maybe he's dead already. Darling, you're so comforting.
- What's going on?
- Hitler's speaking to the Reichstag.
- How do you do, Mr. Dobosh?
- How do you do, Doctor?
This is Dr. Voyawski from the Foreign Office.
How do you do, gentlemen?
I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
The government feels it would be unwise to go on with this play.
What?
You mean, we cannot open tonight?
- I'm afraid that's what it comes down to.
- But why?
- We all have a right to know.
- I know the play has artistic value.
It has much more than that.
That's exactly what the government is afraid of.
It might offend Hitler.
Well, wouldn't that be too bad.
Have you ever read what he says about us?
Do you ever listen to him?
I'm sorry, gentlemen, but the order is final.
"To be, or not to be:
"that is the question:
"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
"The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune..."
Anna, I'd like to speak to Mrs. Tura alone.
Now look, Stanislav, I usually tell my maid when to leave the room.
I have so much to tell you.
When we're in the plane, we can't talk.
When we're in the tearoom, we can't do anything but talk.
When we're in the dressing room, we must be very careful of my makeup.
You know, Maria, the other day in the plane... you didn't think I was watching but I saw you looking at me.
It was a very sympathetic look, I thought.
I had the feeling you like me. Was I wrong?
No, not at all, Stanislav.
- Tell me, Maria. Be frank. You still like me?
- Well, of course.
You still like me, huh? You think you'll always like me?
I don't see any reason why not.
That's wonderful.
What are we going to do with your husband? - What?
- We must tell him, of course.
Tell him what?
That we love each other, that we're mad about each other.
He has no right to stand in our way.
I'm sure he'll realize the situation. So will Mr. Dobosh. - Dobosh?
Where does he come in?
- You don't want to stay on the stage?
I wouldn't let you. You're tired of it, anyway.
You want to live a quiet life. You said so in The Chronicle.
Darling, you're really going to enjoy that farm now.
You won't have to use that plough. I'll buy you a tractor.
I'll build a swimming pool for your goldfish.
You're really a darling... but you don't realize that I'm a married woman.
- That's why I must talk to your husband.
- But I love my husband.
No, you don't.
You're just decent, you're kind, and you feel sorry for him.
Now, don't you worry. It's a situation between men.
- I'll wait here for him.
- Stanislav, you must listen to me.
This is all my fault, but you must understand that I... - Mrs. Tura!
- Stay out, Anna.
Mrs. Tura, it's war!
"Without any declaration of war...
"German troops crossed our border at several points this evening."
Without a word of warning.
They'll pay before they're through. We'll fight them. War.
It's really war.
People are going to kill each other and be killed.
Goodbye, Maria.
- Stanislav, come back. - I have to.
I have to see you again.
- Maria, have you heard?
- Yes, it's war. It seems impossible.
It's incredible.
- Does the audience know?
- No, I have to tell them.
It's a conspiracy. A foul conspiracy!
- It's worse than that. It's a crime! - Absolutely right.
Walking out on me for the second time.
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you understand? It's war!
It's an air alarm!
Close the window! Hurry up, to the basement. Quick!
Anyway, we don't have to worry about the Nazi play anymore.
The Nazis themselves are putting on the show now. A much bigger one.
There's no censor to stop them.
Unhappy Poland.
Attacked without a word of warning by a ruthless conqueror.
Warsaw destroyed for the sake of destruction.
The curtain had fallen on the Polish drama:
a tragedy with no relief in sight.
There was a Nazi tank against every Polish hope... and the people were stunned and helpless.
There was no censor to stop them.
"If you prick us, do we not bleed?
"if you tickle us, do we not laugh?
"if you poison us, do we not die?"
What a Shylock you would have been.
All I had to do was to carry a spear.
I wonder if we'll ever carry a spear again.
Let's hope so.
But a new spirit had come over the people of Poland.
Hate and more hate was the answer to the Nazi terror.
Rebellion against suppression.
Determination to fight at any moment, anywhere, everywhere.
The battle was on. "V."
"V" for "victory!"
Down with the Nazis! Down with Hitler!
The Warsaw underground striking back... sabotage, destruction.
But the real fight for Polish freedom was led somewhere in England.
Young men of Poland avenging their country... the Polish squadron of the RAF.
Well, it's gratifying to see that you still keep your sense of humor.
We are even much funnier over Berlin.
I wish that I were young enough to do for our country what you're doing.
Come on, Professor.
One of your radio speeches is worth 10,000 bombs.
When do we hear you again, Professor Siletsky?
I'm afraid it might be quite some time. Why?
What's the matter? Nothing.
I just happen to be going on a little trip.
And anybody that buys a return ticket these days is decidedly an optimist.
You are going on a secret mission, Professor? I see it's no use.
You boys are too clever for me. Now I know.
He's going to Berlin to call on Hitler.
Not exactly. And I certainly hope that Hitler doesn't call on me.
Thank you for honoring me with an excellent dinner.
- Professor, are you going to Warsaw? - That would be risking your neck.
After all, you boys risk your lives every day, don't you?
So you are going to Warsaw.
Please, I can't tell you any more. I'm sorry that I even mentioned it.
- But you didn't.
- We got it out of you.
After all, if I can't trust you, whom can I trust?
And I know it will be buried right here.
Warsaw.
I'd give my soul to be there for just one hour to see my mother.
If she's still alive.
I only wish it were possible for me to find out.
Could you find out, please? My mother...
I understand exactly how you feel. But you must realize...
I cannot possibly jeopardize the purpose of my trip.
Why don't you tell me where I can reach your people... and I'll try my best?
- Professor Siletsky? - Yes.
My people are fortunately out of Poland... but there is someone in Warsaw.
- A lady? - Yes.
It's a very confidential matter.
I'd appreciate it if you'd tell her...
- But don't tell her husband. - I know exactly what to tell her.
Just say, "To be or not to be." She knows.
A code message?
What's the name of the lady? - It's Maria Tura.
- Just a moment.
I'll write it down.
What did you say the name was?
T-U-R-A.
Is that correct?
Don't tell me you've never heard of Maria Tura? Why?
Should I?
- Well, you lived in Warsaw...
- Yes, of course. The name is familiar.
She's quite well-known. - Well-known?
She's famous. - Yes, indeed.
Here, it's the name of my brother. I don't know if you can read the writing.
- All right. - Lieutenant.
- How do you do, sir? - Gen. Armstrong.
- Major Cunningham.
- How do you do?
Now what did you want to see me about, Lieutenant?
I was thinking about coming here for a couple of days.
I'm probably doing an injustice to an important man. Whom do you suspect?
You see, sir, the other night...
Professor Siletsky was addressing us at the camp... and I mentioned the name of Maria Tura and he'd never heard of her.
Neither have I.
But he's supposed to be a Pole who lived in Warsaw.
She's the most famous actress in Warsaw.
Young man, there are lots of people who are not interested in the theater.
There's only one actress I ever heard of.
And I certainly hope I'll never hear from her again.
Sir, Maria Tura's more than an actress. She's an institution.
You couldn't buy a newspaper without reading about her.
You can't buy a package of cigarettes without her picture inside. They name soap after her.
You couldn't move around in Warsaw without popping into her.
I thought it was my duty to tell you before the professor leaves.
- He left already, didn't he?
- Yes, he was due in Sweden yesterday.
Just a minute.
How'd you know he was leaving? - He told us.
- Told you what?
- That he was going to Warsaw.
- That seems incredible.
After all, we were all Poles together, nobody saw anything wrong in it.
Otherwise, the boys wouldn't give him the addresses.
- Of the relatives in Warsaw.
- He took them?
- Yes, sir.
How could he do such a thing?
If they fall into the hands of the Gestapo... they can take reprisals against all the families.
When does Professor Siletsky get to Warsaw?
He probably took the boat today for Lithuania.
And from Lithuania, that's uncertain. I shall say, three or four days, sir.
How long will it take you to fly to Warsaw?
About six or seven hours, sir.
- You mind waiting outside a minute? - Yes, sir.
I hate to believe it. So do I, sir.
We can't take any chances.
The fellow came here with the highest recommendations possible.
And we checked again and again, sir.
This man is carrying instructions to the underground in Warsaw.
If he delivers them... to the Gestapo instead of the underground... it means, not only the death of hundreds of people... but the destruction of our organization in Eastern Europe.
Of course.
But I hate to condemn a man on such vague evidence.
We're not condemning him.
When Siletsky told those fliers of his trip to Warsaw, he wrote his own sentence.
Of course, he may be just a fool. Then he's just as dangerous.
And I know Siletsky.
He's no fool.
Well, sir, what are your orders?
- Call in the young man. - Yes, sir.
Now look here, Lieutenant... as soon as you get to Warsaw... go to Sztaluga's bookstore... and give him our instructions.
Sztaluga will then inform the underground.
But if someone happens to be in the store, don't mention anything.
Just ask for a copy... of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.
And put Siletsky's picture on Page 105. - Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
- Ten minutes.
- All right.
Halt!
Too bad we missed him.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Have you by any chance Anna Karenina by Tolstoy?
I think I have.
Yes.
Here it is.
- How much is it?
- 20 zloty.
That's much too expensive, I'm sorry.
Goodbye.
- We'll take these stamps.
- How much?
Eight zloty 75.
Goodbye, gentlemen. Come again.
Yes, can I help you gentlemen?
- We are looking for Mrs. Maria Tura.
- I am Mrs. Tura.
You have to come along with us.
I haven't done anything. Why do they want me?
Just come along. Let's go.
205, 206.
Mrs. Tura is here, sir.
Yes, sir.
- Let her wait in 206. - Yes, sir.
Good evening, Mrs. Tura.
- Good evening.
- I'm Professor Siletsky.
It's a great pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Tura.
Won't you sit down?
- Cigarette? - Thank you.
I really must apologize for the manner in which you were brought here.
When a man wants to see a lady so badly... he backs up his invitation with bane.
That's very well put.
As a matter of fact, I'm not responsible for your being brought here at all.
There's a charming young man in England...
Gave me a message for you.
A rather strange message.
"To be or not to be."
You, no doubt know its deeper meaning.
Yes, I have a vague idea.
I really...
Will you forgive me, please?
Hello? Yes.
How do you do, Colonel Ehrhardt?
Yes, the trip was a little bumpy... but I'm certainly glad that you sent that plane to Sweden.
Otherwise...
Whenever you wish, of course.
10:00 tomorrow morning at Gestapo Headquarters... unless I hear from you tonight.
Very well.
I'm looking forward to making your acquaintance.
Goodbye, Colonel.
- I'm sorry.
- Well, I won't keep you any longer.
Thank you for the charming message.
- Mrs. Tura, you're an actress, aren't you?
- Yes.
Naturally, in the theater it's important that you choose the right part.
Very.
But in real life, it's even more important that you choose the right side.
The right side.
What is the right side?
The winning side.
I don't quite understand.
Here in Warsaw, there are a lot of people... that we know very well and a lot of people... that we don't know quite so well and would like to know a great deal better.
That's where you can help us, Mrs. Tura.
You want me to be a spy?
Now, come, that's rather a crude word.
I once played a spy, it was a great success.
I had wonderful notices. It was really an exciting part.
Wouldn't it be exciting to play it in real life?
I got shot in the last act.
I suppose that happens to most spies.
My dear Mrs. Tura, we would never dream... of subjecting anybody as charming as you to danger.
All you'd have to do would be to entertain a little.
For instance, invite certain people...
I can see myself giving a great banquet in my one-room mansion.
Of course, they took my lovely apartment away from me.
I assure you that can be very easily remedied.
Life could be made... very comfortable for you again, Mrs. Tura.
Well, what do you say?
Naturally, it's all very attractive and tempting.
But what are we going to do about my conscience?
We've simply got to convince you that you're going to serve the right cause.
I wonder if you really know what Nazism stands for.
I have a slight idea.
In the final analysis, all we're trying to do is create a happy world.
People who don't want to be happy have no place in this happy world.
That makes sense.
We're not brutal, we're not monsters.
Tell me... do I look like a monster?
Of course not, Professor.
You say that as though you really meant it. - I do.
- We're just like other people.
We love to sing, we love to dance... we admire beautiful women.
We're human. And sometimes...
- very human. - I'm convinced of that.
Why don't you stay here for dinner? I can imagine nothing more charming.
And before the evening is over, I'm sure you'll say, "Heil Hitler."
I would like to accept your invitation... but just as you want to represent the Nazi case in the very best light...
I would like to represent the Polish case in a more suitable dress.
I understand perfectly. Please don't let me wait too long. - Au revoir.
- Just a moment.
- I'm looking forward to it.
- So am I.
- This lady is permitted to leave. - Yes, sir.
This is a very difficult place to get in, but it's much more difficult to get out.
I'm terribly frightened and terribly thrilled. - Bye.
- Bye.
"To be or not to be."
I'm feeling much better. I'm glad at that.
Who are you? How did you get here?
Parachute. I jumped from a plane. Right into my bed?
How did you get into my apartment? Your wife...
Isn't she back?
I'm getting worried. - You're worried?
I'm worried.
- Not so loud, you might endanger all of us.
- After all, we're all in the same boat. - Oh, the same boat?
Then let me ask you something as one sailor to another:
What ill-wind blew you into my slippers?
- Siletsky is here. - What?
At the Hotel Europe.
They took me to him.
- What'd you do at the book store?
- I warned them against Siletsky. Siletsky here.
Then everything's over.
There's still a chance, Siletsky hasn't seen the Gestapo. We have to get to him.
It's impossible.
It's an armed camp. Soldiers everywhere. Does he know I'm here?
No, but he wants me to become a Nazi spy.
- Who wants you to become a Nazi spy? - Siletsky.
- Who is Siletsky?
- A spy.
- And who is he?
- Lieutenant Sobinski.
What are you doing here?
What does that matter?
Don't you understand? Siletsky's here.
It's unbelievable!
I come home to find a man in the same boat with me... and my wife says, "What does it matter?"
But Mr. Tura, this is zero hour.
You simply don't want me to waste time giving you a long explanation.
No, but a husband is entitled to an inkling.
Siletsky wants me to have dinner with him... if we don't get another idea... maybe I'll have to kill him, because only I can get to him.
This wouldn't have happened if the Lieutenant arrived before Siletsky.
But they sent a plane for Siletsky, so he arrived before the Lieutenant.
- Is that clear?
- No.
You're going to have dinner with him?
That's our only chance.
I'll decide with whom my wife has dinner and whom she'll kill.
- Don't you see, Poland's at stake?
- Have you no patriotism?
First, you walk out of my soliloquy, and then you walk into my slippers.
And now you question my patriotism.
I love my country and my slippers.
- I hope your country comes first. - So do I.
- This is an emergency...
- Look...
I don't know much about the whole thing, but is Siletsky a real danger to Poland?
- A catastrophe.
- He must be taken care of.
- And he will be taken care of.
- Who's going to do it?
- I'm going to do it.
- But how?
Where?
I'm going to meet Herr Siletsky at Gestapo Headquarters.
And after I've killed him, I hope you tell me what it was all about.
It took a bit longer than I thought, I wonder if the effect was worth it.
I'm willing to die for our Führer at any moment...
- except for the next few hours.
- Thank you, Professor.
The last time I wore this gown...
It seems like ages.
And I haven't seen such food. Caviar, it still exists.
Yes, on the winning side.
I must admit, you put some very convincing arguments on this table.
It's nice being here, Professor.
I ordered a buffet. We don't want to be interrupted by orderlies.
Naturally. After all, this isn't a fair State.
The best thing is to start your training as an agent... with a glass of champagne.
Shall we drink to a blitzkrieg?
I prefer a slow encirclement.
You know, Professor, I'm a little scared of you. But why?
You shouldn't be. Maybe not.
Maybe there's something very gentle under that beard of yours.
I think you might have a boyish quality, and yet I don't know.
- Why don't you find out?
- I will.
Here, write your name and I'll tell you everything about you.
The first time I saw my husband's handwriting... was on the marriage certificate, then it was too late.
I'm taking an awful chance.
But remember... if a fortune-teller wants to stay in business... she must only tell her client what he really wants to hear.
Professor, if I'd known you made an "S" like that, I wouldn't have come here.
- You're a very determined man.
- Yes, very.
But you have great charm, yes.
I only hope you live up to that "Y," Professor.
You'll see.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.
I am Capt. Muhm, Colonel Ehrhardt's staff.
Please come in.
Just a moment.
I'm sorry, there's been a change in Colonel Ehrhardt's plans.
He'd like to see you immediately.
Yes, of course.
I'll be with you in a minute.
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't tell me you have to leave.
Yes, but I'll make it as quickly as possible.
That's terrible.
I came up here with such doubts in my mind... and now you're going to leave me here just as the cause is getting me.
I won't be long.
Gestapo is so busy these days, I'm sure they'll be glad to get rid of me.
- I'm so sorry.
- Well, it can't be helped.
Just a moment. What's your name? - Mrs. Tura.
- Whom were you visiting?
Professor Siletsky.
Professor left no instructions.
You'll have to wait until he comes back.
- But that's impossible. - Sorry.
There is nothing I can do about it. - 206.
- Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
- Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler.
Wait one moment, I'll announce you to Colonel Ehrhardt.
Goodbye, Colonel.
- Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler.
Isn't this the gentleman from England, Captain?
- Yes, General.
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Professor.
A very great pleasure.
You certainly fooled the English, didn't you?
The British lion will drink his tea... from saucers made in Germany.
- Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler.
How did he ever become a general?
He's Göring's brother-in-law.
- I'll announce you to the Colonel. - Thank you.
He brought the papers with him. Now remember.
Who were his helpers in England?
- When you find out call me, I'll do the rest. - All right.
- Tura, you're playing for our lives.
I'm going to do the impossible.
I'm going to surpass myself. Don't.
Take it easy and don't draw out the scene please.
Come on, let's go.
I hate to leave the fate of my country in the hands of a ham.
Send him in.
- Professor, please. - Thank you.
- Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler.
Professor Siletsky, I'm glad to see you.
And I'm glad to see you, too. - Sit down, please.
- Thank you very much.
I can't tell you how delighted we are to have you.
May I say, my dear Colonel, that it's good to breathe the air of the Gestapo again.
You know, you're quiet famous in London, Colonel.
They call you "Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt. Yes.
We do the concentrating, and the Poles do the camping.
Yes, indeed. Well, here's the report... and that's the end of the underground movement.
Let's see this.
Excellent.
They're as good as dead.
I assume, there are no supplementary documents still at the hotel.
- No, that covers everything. - Good.
And I'm sending the duplicate to Berlin the first thing in the morning.
The duplicate? Yes, of course, the duplicate.
If you ask me, it's a lot of red tape.
But since they want it, well, all right. Naturally.
You know, Professor...
Warsaw is a dangerous place these days.
But I suppose you have the papers in the hotel safe?
No, they're locked in my trunk. The whole hotel is a safe.
Yes, of course.
Naturally.
I want to get the machinery started on this report right away.
- I'll be back in a moment. - Very well.
- All right, I'll get this wrapped up. - No.
He still has papers in his trunk.
Papers in his trunk?
I'll kill that dirty dog any how.
How are we going to get into his hotel?
Get back there and keep him there. We'll try to figure something out.
Colonel, is there anything else you want to ask me? Lots.
Sit down, Professor. There are many things I want to ask you.
So many things.
Anything you want to know, I'd only be too happy to oblige. Thank you.
So they call me "Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt?
You know, Professor...
- there's something I wanted to ask you. - Yes?
That's the way it is. A thousand questions on your mind... yet you can't think of anything to ask.
But it will crystallize.
Maybe there's something you like to ask me?
No, I can't think of anything, Colonel.
So they call me "Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt.
Well. Excuse me a minute, I'll be right back.
- I'm running out of dialogue.
- We got it.
- Put this gun in your pocket.
- Take him to the hotel.
As soon as you're in his room, hit his head with the butt of the gun.
Then, take his keys, open his trunk and burn the papers.
Then you shoot him.
All right. Just a minute.
What'll happen to me? They'll kill me.
- We're going to keep our fingers crossed. - Good.
Wait a minute.
You go to the hotel and I'll cross my fingers.
Here, think of something else.
So they really call me "Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt?
Colonel, unless there's something urgent, I'd like to relax a little.
Relax? Oh, Mrs. Tura.
Tell me, how is Mrs. Tura? Sit down, Professor.
You see, my Gestapo men are very efficient.
I simply thought she might be of some value to us as an agent.
And besides that, she's very good company.
Very good company?
Colonel, if you'd like to meet Mrs. Tura, I'd be glad to introduce you.
Well, thank you.
And if you happen to take a liking to the lady...
Maybe you'll even put in a good word for me?
I'd be delighted.
Well, thank you.
- Tell me, hasn't she a husband?
- Yes, but what does it matter?
Yes, what does it?
By the way, I believe her husband is that great Polish actor...
Joseph Tura. Of course, you've heard of him?
No, I haven't.
As a matter of fact, I never even heard of Maria Tura before, either.
You didn't? Then how did you get in touch with her?
It's rather a delicate story.
There's a young Polish flier in England, I think his name is Sobinski.
- Asked me to deliver a message to her.
- Well... that's very interesting.
What was the message?
I had to swear to this young Romeo not to tell the husband.
That gives you a rough idea of the message.
Yes.
- It is a little rough.
- Seems they have a secret love code.
- Am I boring you?
- No, I find it very interesting.
This flier gave me the message, and I couldn't make head nor tail of it... and neither will you.
But Mrs. Tura seemed to understand it perfectly.
Well, what was the message?
- "To be or not to be."
- To be...
- To be or not to be!
- Colonel, it's nothing alarming...
- it's only Shakespeare.
- That's what you think.
Professor Siletsky, you amaze me.
You, a Gestapo man, bringing a message to a Polish woman from the enemy.
And when I say enemy, I mean enemy!
You think they had a romance?
I couldn't swear to it, but I don't doubt it. Do you?
No!
And I'm going to find out if I have to mobilize the whole Gestapo.
But, Colonel, I don't understand... suppose these two did have a romance, that's nothing you have to worry about.
The only person that has to worry is the husband.
And that's enough! I'm going to arrest this Maria Tura.
I guess you're right, Professor.
I've been with the Gestapo so long...
- I get suspicious of everyone.
- And so do I.
So they call me "Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt.
- Coming back to Mrs. Tura.
- Let's forget about her.
There's nothing mysterious about her, she's just a cheap, little...
I think I know what you mean.
Then I don't have to say it, do I?
Do you mind if I'm repetitious, Colonel Ehrhardt?
Why? No, not at all.
As I said before, Colonel Ehrhardt... the only one that has to worry about all this is the lady's husband.
That great Polish actor, Joseph Tura.
- Well, that's none of my concern.
- But it should be, Mr. Tura.
Raise your hands, quickly, please.
- Did you ever play a corpse, Mr. Tura?
- What?
You're going to be one unless you do exactly as I say.
Get to the door and tell your friends to clear away from there.
I won't do it.
Turn around. Get over there and face that wall.
Now, stay there.
Sure you won't change your mind? I'll give you one more chance.
Farewell, Mr. Tura.
Long live Poland!
- What happened?
- I don't know, he must have gone out.
There he is!
Get him!
Get backstage. Raise the curtain.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
- Professor Siletsky.
- Professor Siletsky isn't here.
- You expect him back?
- Yes, certainly.
Do you mind if I wait here for the Professor?
No, not at all.
Thank you.
- Good night, Professor Siletsky.
- Good night.
- Good night, Professor.
- Good night.
- Professor Siletsky?
- Yes?
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
I'm Capt. Schultz of Colonel Ehrhardt's staff.
Well, I'm glad to meet you, Captain.
Mrs. Tura.
I thought you had left, Madame.
You forgot to leave word for me to get out... but now I don't regret that I've waited.
And how is Professor Siletsky?
Dead. Absolutely dead.
I had to take care of some business. How about a glass of champagne?
No, thank you. I don't drink.
- Cigarette?
- Thank you. I don't smoke.
- Just like our Führer.
- Yes.
Well, Captain, I'm terribly sorry to have kept you waiting.
I tried to entertain the Captain, but he seems to be the suspicious type.
I admit I was a little surprised when I came in.
And I don't blame you.
Here the whole Gestapo has been working for a long time, day and night... trying to find out every little thing about everybody... and I arrive, and in a few hours I find the most attractive lady in town.
You didn't know Madame before?
Well, no. Not exactly. But the explanation is very simple.
I just asked Mrs. Tura here to deliver a message.
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.
There's a young flier, a very good friend of the Turas... and particularly of Mrs. Tura.
But he's no particular friend of mine.
Nevertheless, a friend. It was a code message.
Code message?
Mrs. Tura has nothing to hide from the Gestapo... but she has one tiny little secret.
If her husband ever found out, he would murder her.
By the way, he is that great Polish actor, Joseph Tura.
- You've probably heard of him?
- No, I haven't.
Professor, Colonel Ehrhardt... Yes.
I'm going to meet him promptly, 10:00 tomorrow morning.
There has been a change in the Colonel's plans.
You're not going to take him away?
I'm sorry. But the Colonel is expecting the Professor now.
Those are my orders.
Well, it looks like I'll have to go. Excuse me a moment.
Sweetheart.
Darling.
Open the trunk. Burn all the papers. - All right.
What did you do with Siletsky?
- What did you do with Sobinski?
That's unimportant now, don't you realize... you're going into the hands of the Gestapo?
Yes, the scene is loaded with dynamite. One little slip and I'm a dead man.
You know I'm never any good unless I have my peace of mind.
Maria, be honest, be frank. I've got to know.
Did you tell that fellow to walk out of my soliloquy?
Sweetheart, darling, I love you.
Don't you know that?
Don't you feel it? If anything happened to you...
You think I can do it?
You're a great actor. Nobody can play it but you.
You can, and you will do it.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye.
If I shouldn't come back, I forgive what happened between you and Sobinski.
But if I come back, it's a different matter.
- Yes?
- Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler.
- Professor Siletsky is here.
Have him come in.
Didn't you understand what I told you?
Did you arrest him? Why not? You have no proof?
Now, that's a fine excuse. Arrest him, too.
Whenever in doubt, arrest him.
How many times do I have to tell you, arrest him? Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
Professor, at last we meet.
Please make yourself at home. Won't you take off your coat?
Thank you. Colonel Ehrhardt...
I can't tell you how happy I am to breathe the air of the Gestapo again.
Thank you very much. Cigarette, cigar, glass of brandy?
No, thank you.
There was a sudden change in my schedule.
Confidentially, big news.
A very old friend of yours is coming to Warsaw. The Führer.
I know you will be delighted to see the Führer again.
- Who wouldn't? - That's right.
How long since you've seen him, Professor?
- Too long. Much too long. - Of course.
Tell me, is Berchtesgaden really as beautiful as they say it is?
Yes, I think I can say that without any risk.
But it isn't the architecture or the landscaping... it's the presence of the Führer that lends the real beauty to the place.
Naturally. Well, what news you bring from London? London?
Oh, yes, London.
Colonel, you're quiet famous in London.
You know what they call you? "Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt.
They do, do they?
So they call me "Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt.
I thought you would react just that way.
Well, Professor, let's have your information.
I think I can stand a glass of brandy, after all.
Certainly. Brandy.
That makes me think of a very funny story which is going all over Warsaw.
A story about our Führer. Now, how does it go?
Yes. They named a brandy after Napoleon.
They made a herring out of Bismarck.
And the Führer's going to end up as a piece of cheese.
Don't you think it's funny?
No. Neither would the Führer.
I don't believe Adolf Hitler will go down in history as a delicatessen.
Professor, I was only joking, just repeating what I heard.
After all, I'll never...
Please don't misunderstand me.
- See, I'm loyal. Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
Professor, do you intend to tell the Führer about this?
- Why should I ruin you?
- Of course, that's very nice.
I can promise you the Führer will never hear it from my lips.
- My word of honor.
- Thank you.
Please, Professor, if you'd be so kind, what about the underground movement?
- What exactly are your plans?
- You want to know?
Yes, if you don't mind.
I have the key in my hand, all I have to find is the lock.
It's better having the lock than the key. How does it sound?
Promising. Most promising.
But tell me, what exactly do you intend to do?
- Well, let's get down to details.
- Yes, if you please.
There are no details. At least, not yet.
The important thing is...
I have the name of the leader of the whole underground movement.
- If we play our cards right and carefully...
- I understand.
If you watch the shepherd, you're bound to find the flock.
- What's the name of the shepherd?
- Boguslaw Revanski.
Send Capt. Schultz in.
So, they call me "Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt?
Capt. Schultz, there's a man in this town...
- What's his name?
- Revanski.
- You mean, Bogoslov Revanski?
- Yes.
- You don't have to worry about him.
- What?
We shot him two days ago.
Revanski shot? I refuse to believe it.
Don't you realize whom you shot, Capt. Schultz?
I tried to get the key man of the underground movement... and just when we were ready...
It's sabotage!
I resent that, Professor.
Why did you shoot him?
We have proof that this man was telling some outrageous stories about the Führer.
- That's no reason to shoot him.
- I agree with you.
At least not right away.
You shot Revanski like that.
Would it have been better to look him over first?
Why don't we look over people before we shoot them?
I'm sorry, but you signed the order of execution yourself.
I sign so many every day.
I can't rely on my own people anymore.
Please, Colonel, maybe we can still save the situation.
There's one other man. A possibility. A good possibility.
Maximilian Pietrowski.
Maximilian Pietrowski?
Don't tell me you...
Yes.
Colonel, all I can say is, you can't have your cake and shoot it, too.
It can't be done.
If they hear about this in England, they'll give you the Victoria Cross.
- I resent that, Professor.
- That's all, Schultz.
Yes, sir.
I didn't like the way Capt. Schultz shifted the responsibility back to you.
Neither did I. There's always something wrong... with a man who doesn't drink, smoke, or eat meat.
- You mean our Führer?
- No, please, Professor.
- Hope you won't...
- Why should I ruin you again?
Thank you so much.
I suppose you want to go back as soon as possible to London.
- London? Yes, certainly.
- When did you plan to leave?
- I'd like to get out as soon as possible.
- Under the circumstances, that's best.
We have a plane leaving on Thursday for Sweden.
- I'll make a reservation for you.
- That's fine.
- Better make that two reservations.
- Two? My trip was successful in one respect. I made a discovery.
A certain Mrs. Tura.
She'll be the most valuable assistant I've ever had.
- Frankly, I don't believe in women agents.
- You'll change your mind if you meet her.
Why don't you? Form your own opinion?
If you say "no," it's no.
I'll call you at the hotel. What was the lady's name?
Mrs. Tura.
Her husband is that great Polish actor, Joseph Tura.
- You've probably heard of him?
- Yes. I saw him on the stage when I was in Warsaw, before the War.
Really?
What he did to Shakespeare, we are doing now to Poland.
- Goodbye, Colonel.
- Goodbye, Professor.
I'm Colonel Ehrhardt. Will you sit down, please?
- Mrs. Tura, I sent for you.
- I'm very grateful.
I can't make up my mind.
Yes, it sounds very intriguing and exciting...
Mrs. Tura, I have bad news for you.
If you don't think I'm the right person... it will be disappointing, but the cause must come first.
No, Mrs. Tura. It isn't that.
Prepare yourself for a shock.
Professor Siletsky is dead.
- Dead?
- Murdered.
I can't believe it. It can't be.
- When did this happen?
- We haven't found out yet.
I only got the report just now.
- Was it at the hotel?
- No. He was evidently trapped somewhere.
The Führer has just arrived in Warsaw.
The men are planning a great reception... for him tonight.
A performance by the soldiers.
They opened the Theatre Polski.
They tried to arrange some scenery.
One of the props broke and out fell the body of Professor Siletsky.
Who could have done such a thing? Have you any idea?
We're certain, the bullet found in his body came from a British service revolver.
Yesterday, the British landed someone here by parachute.
So the only mystery left is, where is this man?
Believe me, we're going to get him.
- I hope so.
- My poor Professor.
I had an appointment with him this afternoon.
He was due here any minute.
Thank you very much.
I won't take up any more of your time. Goodbye.
Mrs. Tura, I want you to know that your ties with us are not broken.
- You might be very valuable to us.
- Thank you.
It doesn't have to be London. I might have something here in Warsaw.
Colonel, whatever you decide, if you want me...
Naturally, I would have to know you a little better.
That is my duty and if I may say, my pleasure.
That's nice of you, Colonel.
- But at the moment...
- It doesn't have to be today.
When you feel a little better, maybe we can have dinner together.
- Why don't you let me know?
- I will.
And don't take it too hard, little woman.
- I'll try not to.
- That's the spirit.
Mrs. Tura seems to be rather upset.
Naturally, it's very unfortunate what happened to Siletsky.
- After all, he died for the Führer.
- Naturally.
Hello. Good morning, Professor Siletsky. I have...
You will be a little late.
Yes, I understand.
Will you please announce me to Professor Siletsky?
- The Professor left quite a while ago.
- He did? Thank you.
- Was Tura here?
- Yeah.
- Did he say anything?
- He just rushed in... punched me in the jaw, and rushed out.
- Dobosh, you know what happened? - Yes.
It's all right, Joseph just left.
- What do you mean?
- He had trouble.
Somebody must have grabbed his beard.
I fixed it up and gave him an extra beard.
Just in case. You can't tell with Tura.
He's lost. They found the body in the theater.
- They know everything.
- What?
- Who opened the theater?
- The Nazis.
- Who gave them the key?
- You idiot you, shut up!
They're gonna kill him. You've got to do something. Help him.
Rawitch, do something.
Everything is all right.
- The Professor is here.
- We will be delighted.
Professor, please.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler. How is the Professor?
- Fine, thank you. How is the Colonel?
- Excellent. May I?
Tell me, Colonel, what was your impression of Mrs. Tura?
- Wonderful.
- I'm glad you feel that way.
Yes, indeed.
This is Capt. Mueller and It.
Brundt of our Special Investigation Squad.
Or what we call the Hotfoot Department.
- How do you do?
- It's a pleasure.
I think we should have a good talk before you leave.
I have to take up a few things with these gentlemen.
Would you mind stepping into my living room?
He should have cracked by now.
Give him a little time. Let him enjoy his goose pimples.
Colonel, do you really prefer this procedure to our usual methods?
I would say with intellectuals, the mental approach is more effective... and much quicker.
But if he shouldn't turn out to be an intellectual?
Then we try a little physical culture.
I don't want to hurry you, but do you think it will be much longer?
- Did you get bored?
- No, I tried to open up a conversation... with your friend in there, but he seems to be dead.
No. Really. Let's go and see.
It looks like murder.
If I'm wrong, Colonel, please correct me.
There seems to be a slight resemblance between me and your late friend.
- Has that struck you, too?
- Definitely.
I have a terrible suspicion that one of us must be an imposter.
Now that you mention it, I think you're right.
Now, just for fun, Colonel, which one of us do you think is the imposter?
I hope you won't consider it impolite, Professor... but there's a general feeling in this room that it's you.
Please forgive me.
- Certainly. You mind if I play detective?
- Go right ahead, Professor Siletsky.
Thank you.
- Edmondson's London.
- The real Siletsky came from London.
The suit was bought in London.
- You think it looks bad for me?
- Terrible.
His watch is still running.
Which means he was killed, since the real Professor Siletsky arrived in...
This really looks bad for me. I'm liable to get shot.
There's a distinct possibility.
There's no doubt there was a definite purpose.
- He wanted to look like me...
- Or you wanted to look like him.
That's right.
Our hair is cut alike and even the shape of our beards is somewhat similar.
Not similar. Exactly alike.
- How long did you know each other?
- I just meet him here.
Now you're lying.
Plain lying. You must have observed him for months.
It takes that long to grow a beard of that kind.
- Very good, Schultz.
- Excellent, Schultz.
Except you forget I may be wearing a false beard.
Very funny.
No, Professor. I'll tell you a better story.
- Maybe he is wearing a false beard.
- I hardly think so.
Why don't you convince yourself?
Why don't you pull his beard?
- I can't do it.
- No, you can't.
Too sensitive. You can murder a man, kill in cold blood... but you cannot pull a man's beard!
I can't believe it.
How dare you put me in this position?
I can't rely on anybody.
- You gave the order yourself...
- Shifting the responsibility on me again?
That's all, Schultz. Bye-bye, gentlemen.
- Professor, I don't know how to apologize.
- You were only doing your duty.
If there's a slightest doubt in your mind, why don't you pull my beard?
- Please, Professor.
No. - Come on. Just once.
Don't rub it in.
I assure you, I never believed it for one minute... but this Schultz...
And, Professor, if you see the Führer...
You'd appreciate it if I didn't tell him.
- I won't tell.
- Thank you so much.
Now, the important thing is to get you to London as quickly as possible.
- With Mrs. Tura?
- Of course. Anything you say, Professor.
- Get me the airport.
- Where's Colonel Ehrhardt's office?
- Heil Hitler. Colonel Ehrhardt?
- Yes, sir.
I'm in charge of the Führer's Safety Squad.
I ride with the Führer this morning, and in one hour...
I uncover a plot against his life. Can't I rely on anyone?
- But, General...
- Arrest this man.
- No, General.
- This man's an imposter.
- Are you crazy?
- He is Professor Siletsky.
What do you have to say for yourself now?
Here is a man with a beard, and you didn't even pull it.
I never saw a more gross neglected duty in my life.
- General...
- I've no confidence in you anymore.
I'm taking charge of this case myself.
There will be a reorganization here, and your head will not be spared.
- And furthermore...
- General, may I remind you... of your appointment with the Führer?
Yes. You'll hear from me.
Take him out.
Piece of cheese?
Schultz!
I had a plane arranged, but Mr. Rawitch had a burning desire to act again.
When Mr. Rawitch acts, someone has to suffer.
Please, Mr. Tura. Forgive me for trying to save your life.
Who really bust the whole thing up?
If you hadn't been so stupid...
- and jealous of your wife.
- I hope it's true.
- But it isn't.
- We'll talk about that later.
- Friends...
- Romans and countrymen.
We know you want to play Mark Antony, but that doesn't help us.
In 24 hours, they'll know everything.
Then we're caught like rats in a trap.
Just a moment.
Hitler, of course, will be sitting in the royal box tonight.
You remember two years ago, we played Murder in The Opera House?
- It was a flop.
- It might be again.
But we have to take the chance to get out of here.
The situation is very similar.
There'll be soldiers in the corridor... guarding Hitler's box.
If we can get them away for just one second...
That means we need a confusion, a commotion among the Gestapo.
I have started a commotion on every Gestapo man I've met.
No, we can't use you. There'll be no ladies.
Greenberg.
Yes, Mr. Dobosh.
If we can manage that Greenberg suddenly pops up among the Nazis...
- It'll get a terrific laugh.
- No, it won't.
Greenberg, you always wanted to play an important part.
- What do I have to do, Mr. Dobosh?
- If you don't play it right, we're all lost.
And if you do play it right, I still can't guarantee anything.
- What do I have to do?
- All right, let's rehearse.
- How does it look?
- Excellent.
Sobinski, it's time to go.
- I'm ready.
- Let's see.
- Looks all right.
- Yes. He looks very good.
- I'll pick you up about 9:00.
- Oh, darling. Goodbye.
If anything should go wrong, if you shouldn't come back...
- Then Sobinski won't come back either.
- Goodbye, darling.
I guess you want to say goodbye. Go ahead.
This may be the last time we'll see each other.
I can only say it was wonderful knowing you, Maria.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Tura.
- Goodbye, Mr. Sobinski.
- Heil the Führer.
- Heil.
- How did you get here?
- I was born here.
- What made you decide to die here?
- Him.
- What do you want from the Führer?
- What does he want from us?
What does he want from Poland? Why all this? Why?
"Aren't we human?
Have we not eyes? Have we not hands...
"organs, senses, dimensions, affections, passions?
"fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons...
"subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means...
"cooled and warmed by the same winter and summer.
"If you prick us, do we not bleed?
"if you tickle us, do we not laugh?
"if you poison us, do we not die?
"if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?"
- Lieutenants Lange and Schneider.
- Yes, sir.
Take charge of him and bring him to my headquarters.
I want to question him.
Men, I don't want a word to leak out about this incredible incident.
- Who's in charge here?
- I am, sir.
How could this have happened?
- I don't know, sir.
- You don't know.
That's just it. That's how you safeguard our Führer.
My Führer, it is my duty to advise you to leave immediately.
To the airport. We have to make a stop on the way.
I'll tell you where.
Greenberg, he always wanted to play Shylock.
And he got his chance at last.
And he'll play it again.
Not in the corridor, but on the stage of the Polski theater.
- The railroad station.
- The underground is still alive.
Yes. We saved the underground.
Bronski, now we belong to history.
- They might even erect a monument to us.
I can see myself sitting on a horse for the next century.
Yes, and sometimes when...
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I am such a nervous wreck, I'm imagining things.
- Imagining what?
- I thought you were wearing a mustache.
- I am.
- No, you're not.
Are you crazy?
Where's my mustache? This is a catastrophe.
We've got to find it.
I can't get out without it. I've got to get Maria.
- What did you do with it?
- My mustache!
We got to find it.
Good evening, Mrs. Tura.
I suppose you're surprised to see us?
I'm delighted, gentlemen, but unfortunately I have an appointment.
We have several things we want to find out.
Couldn't I see you tomorrow at your office?
No, I'm sorry. It is very urgent.
The Colonel and I were talking things over.
Mrs. Tura, we consider you a women of enormous appeal.
Thank you. But what's so very urgent about that?
It struck me as rather peculiar why anybody like you could be...
- attracted to Professor Siletsky.
- You never can tell about those things.
For instance, you're attractive yourself.
Perhaps my taste is a little peculiar.
But I haven't Professor Siletsky's distinguished beard.
- That's what fascinated you so much.
- Yes, it did intrigue me.
Brought out the child in me.
I always felt like pulling it, but I didn't.
- What do you mean by that?
- It was a false beard, you know that.
He fooled me and he certainly fooled you, Colonel.
How do you know all this?
- Gen. Von Seidelman.
- What do you know about him?
He asked me to his office, and I had to answer a million questions.
He thanked me for the information and...
Gentlemen, do you by any chance suspect me?
- Mrs. Tura...
- General thought everything was all right.
If Gen. Von Seidelman thinks it's all right, then it is all right.
- What are you trying to get me into now?
- Colonel, it was your own idea.
Shifting the responsibility on me again.
- Good night, Schultz.
- Good night, Colonel.
This Schultz! Oh, Mrs. Tura, I'm so sorry.
I don't like to be impolite, but I have an appointment.
I'll drive you there.
You don't understand. Someone is coming.
- Someone is coming here.
- If he should find you...
I am here on official business. There is nothing to worry about.
Mrs. Tura, consider yourself in the arms of the Gestapo.
- Colonel, I'm a married woman.
- But you're expecting someone.
- Now I have to stay here.
- Colonel...
I have to protect your husband.
- No, Colonel, you mustn't do this.
- Mrs. Tura, I'll give you a bracelet.
- I confiscated a beautiful one today.
- I don't want a bracelet.
I can make life worth living for you.
I can give you extra butter rations.
I'll give you three eggs a week.
I don't want any eggs. Colonel, please go.
Maria.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- How could I? Don't you understand?
Haven't you any tact?
My Führer!
Schultz!
Gentlemen, the Führer wants to talk to both of you himself.
The Lieutenant will take the control.
- Yes, mein Führer.
- Jump.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
Two very obliging fellows.
Now let's go to England.
First it was Hess, now it's him.
Everybody, a nice smile. Thank you.
And you, Mr. Tura.
You played the real hero in this amazing play.
I did my best and I was very ably assisted by my colleagues.
Thank you, my friends, for everything you did.
As little as it may have been.
I am sure England will want to show its gratitude.
What do you desire most, Mr. Tura?
- Well, I...
- He wants to play Hamlet.
After all, we are in the country of William Shakespeare...
He wants to play Hamlet.
"Than is my deed to my most painted word.
"O heavy burden!"
"I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my Lord."
"To be or not to be."
THE DEVIL'S ENVOYS
...and so, in the lovely month of May, 1485, the Devil sent two of his envoys to this world to drive humans to despair...
There it is.
Tell me, my good man.
Would the lord of this castle welcome two minstrels who've traveled far to entertain him?
- I believe so.
You're in luck.
Baron Hugues loves music and soon Miss Anne will be wed to Sir Renaud.
Since the engagement, it's been banquet after banquet.
In festive times, my skills aren't needed, so I fish to pass the time.
Thank you, good man.
No, let me thank you for calling me "good man"!
In spite of everything, it's nice to hear!
Come to me, pretty frogs!
Make up your minds!
Afraid of the executioner?
Then come to the "good man"!
My lords!
Kind lords!
How heavy is my heart!
A beast who never hurt anyone, a beast who made the whole castle laugh!
He was just crossing the courtyard and the guards shot him, just for sport.
This is all I have left!
He's dead, kind lords.
He was my brother!
What will I do?
Woe is me!
- Why bother, Gilles?
- I enjoy doing good sometimes.
Why bother?
These performers are putting me to sleep.
Let's hope this one is more entertaining.
You're hard to please. I found the juggler quite amusing.
He has a sad face.
Father, isn't his face sad?
- Shall I throw him out?
- I don't wish to cause him harm.
It'd be a shame to lose such a face. I agree!
His hollow cheeks make me hungry! Stand up.
Show us what you can do.
Nothing myself, noble lord, but I can display three extremely rare creatures.
Few have ever seen them.
Commoners are naive and easily frightened.
Only the great can properly appreciate these oddities of nature.
You're too sensitive, Anne. Take a look.
I assure you, they're very funny.
I don't want to.
Look, just to make me happy.
Then look back at me. You'll only love me more.
I don't want to see them. I feel sorry for them.
Take them away.
I don't want you to be sad, dear child.
These banquets are to make you happy.
Think you're pretty enough to mock them?
I'm no beauty, but compared to them, I must seem pretty!
I believe my daughter would like to hear sweet things that touch the heart.
Stories of romance, the yearnings of simple hearts.
Are there any singers in the hall?
Demons and marvels
Winds and waves
Far away already
And you Like seaweed
Caressed by the wind
In the dunes of your bed
You stir in your sleep
Demons and marvels
Winds and waves
Far away already
But in your half-open eyes
Two little waves
Demons and marvels
Winds and waves
Two little waves
To drown myself in
You sing well, young man. Who are you?
My name is Gilles.
This is my brother, Dominique.
Sing us another song.
The tender and dangerous face of love
Appeared to me one night after an endless day
Perhaps it was an archer with his bow
Perhaps a musician with his harp
I know no more
I know nothing
All I know
Is that he wounded me
Perhaps with an arrow
Perhaps with a song
All I know
Is that he wounded me
His shot hit my heart wounded forever
Burning Ardently burning
This wound of love
With its little sighs and big deceits!
Before, at least we had songs about war, hunting, the urge to fight, to kill.
You're too harsh, Renaud.
I might not have loved Baroness Berthe like in the songs, but she meant so much to me.
So much.
But my wife is dead and times have changed.
Now everyone speaks of love. Too much!
I don't like it.
You look proud of yourself.
How dare you gaze into a lady's eyes while crooning such nonsense?
Renaud, please!
If I had you hung, would you sing as sweetly with a rope around your throat?
I doubt it.
Then sing no more if you value the pitiful thing you call your life!
Your mind is elsewhere, Anne.
Are you sad because of how I spoke of love?
No, dear friend.
I'm not angry with you.
You know, I also used to dance when Berthe was still alive.
My creatures are tired. Where may they sleep?
I'll show you the room reserved for the performers.
- What are you thinking of?
- Nothing.
Then who are you thinking of?
Did I ever give you reason for jealousy?
Fortunately, no.
I simply wish to remind you that soon you will be mine.
Did you hear me?
- Yes, Renaud.
Your every pleasure, desire, even sorrow, if you have any, should be given to me.
May I at least dream?
As little as possible!
Dreams are dangerous and useless.
I never dream myself.
As soon as I saw you, I knew why I'd traveled so far.
I thanked Heaven for leading me to you.
As soon as I saw you, I knew you'd come for me.
I knew it.
I'm sure my life will change.
Do you regret it?
No.
Will you regret it?
Never.
Even if it makes me suffer.
Those who love never suffer.
Look at them.
Do they suffer?
No.
They feel marvelously alone, the moonlight shines on their love.
And those two star-gazers, what are they thinking of?
Nothing.
Not even the stars.
They are together, in love.
They are happy.
And that solitary man.
So sad, so hopeless.
Surely his beloved has left him, or he her, and so the moon, the stars, the birds, the very trees of this garden no longer exist for him.
He hears nothing, he sees nothing.
He's all alone.
His love is gone.
If you ever left me,
I'd be in despair, like him.
My page Guillaume, with Agnès?
I didn't know they were in love.
They're not.
For them, it's a game.
They toy with love.
That's the one who truly loves Guillaume.
Louison?
She hides and watches them.
She wants to cry.
She's ugly, no one loves her.
If she loves him, why is she ugly?
It's not fair.
It makes me sad, too.
I don't want you to be sad tonight.
She's so pretty now!
It's nothing.
The devilish beauty of youth.
I don't believe in the Devil!
You're lucky.
My name is Anne.
Anne... you're the most marvelous creature I ever met.
I'm so happy.
I'll never forget you.
If this is just a dream,
I hope I never wake up.
Why do you laugh?
Isn't it funny?
You just met me, and already, you say you love me.
Time is unimportant.
I love you. That's just how it is.
How can I believe that?
Before, you had nothing but scorn for love.
"Before" is already far away.
Now you're near me.
That's what matters.
I must be dreaming!
Where did you come from?
Who are you?
Who am I?
You just said it.
A woman who's near you, in your arms.
Come, Anne.
Renaud?
With another woman?
As soon as I saw you, I knew why I'd traveled so far.
I thanked Heaven for leading me to you.
Alas, I must leave soon.
I don't want you to leave.
Take this ring.
If we're ever apart, it will remind you of me.
Your mind is elsewhere.
Your thoughts also seem far away.
Who gave you that chain?
Who gave you that ring?
You're in a pitiful state.
Gilles and Dominique Dominique and Gilles
The Devil treats his children well If they obey him well
Remember Remember
What's written is written!
You signed a pact with him!
Gilles and Dominique Dominique and Gilles
Who pretend to love
Remember
You must continue It's your destiny:
Seduction, Corruption, Villainy Then to leave in despair
Those who believed your sweet whispers!
Monsters.
Always monsters.
We won't sleep tonight.
Did you want to?
- Don't laugh.
- Why not?
If I find it amusing, what's wrong with that?
You haven't given me much reason to laugh since we've lived together.
Be quiet!
Why stir up long-dead things?
Who killed them?
Did I?
Did you?
Or both?
Who nipped in the bud Our story of love?
Enough!
You know we never really loved each other.
We'd known too many before we met, played at love too many times.
- Be quiet!
Why?
Remorse!
Too bad. I've heard it helps pass the time.
If I felt remorse, it might help, wouldn't it?
But why would I?
Men have loved me, as they like to whisper in my ear.
I let them.
Is it my fault if they wept, gave everything for me, even their lives?
The young men were passionate, the old men crawled at my feet.
When did I ever cry or throw myself at your feet?
You're different.
Greedy, stubborn, proud.
You just want to be loved, to take without giving, to keep it all and leave.
Like you!
You hunted me like a cat hunts a mouse.
But we're both cats, there is no mouse.
It's not our fault. We both thought we'd caught a tender new victim.
Two executioners, face to face and no one to torture!
How sad!
- Enough!
If you'd truly loved me,
If you'd truly loved me,
I, too, might have loved you.
Go on.
Scare me.
Hit me.
Kill me. Slit my throat.
My handsome love.
What's the point?
What is signed, is signed.
Aren't we happy?
Others love us, they suffer for us.
We watch them and we go away.
A lovely trip and the Devil picks up the bill.
Good night, Gilles.
Want to know where I'm going?
I already know.
Where will you spend the night?
Obviously!
It'd be a shame to disturb her dreams.
Such tender creatures should be wooed in daylight.
Baron Hugues!
What do you want at this hour, young man?
How dare you knock at my door?
I don't know, a sudden impulse.
Don't be angry, even if you can't understand.
I'm in grave danger.
I feel so alone, so helpless.
Touch my heart.
Feel how it pounds!
Alas, it's true, I belong to the weaker sex.
So weak!
You alone know my secret.
As soon as I saw you, I knew why I'd traveled so far.
I thanked Heaven for leading me to you.
Who are you?
Where did you come from?
I abandoned everything to escape a terrible fate, but I'm still so troubled.
I need help and advice.
How can I help you when I myself live in the past, in my memories?
It's not good to live in the past.
I try to forget everything.
Alas, my brother is only my brother and I am so alone.
So am I, child.
When my wife died, I lost my desire to live.
How you must have loved her!
Yes.
We loved each other.
Love is a beautiful thing.
It was long ago. I'm old now.
Don't say that.
If one is young at heart, that's true youth.
She's in her bed
She sleeps and dreams she is yours
You must make her wait
The more she waits The more she'll love you
The more she loves you The more she'll suffer!
What is your desire, now that I've confided i n you?
What is my desire?
Why ask such a question?
What do I desire?
I desire you, totally, completely, and you know it!
You're so blunt.
Sorry to offend. Perhaps it's no way to woo women, but I speak my mind.
I said you were blunt, not that I didn't like it.
Too many who call themselves men tremble and sigh for their sweethearts.
And you said you don't know how to talk to women!
The way you talk, who'd believe your wedding is so near?
Leave the wedding out of it.
It's cruel of you to remind me.
Is it true that traditionally, the newlyweds' chamber is prepared and left open well in advance of the wedding?
Yes, that's our custom.
A lovely tradition. I'd love to see the chamber.
How commendable, this bedroom awaiting a young couple destined for each other.
Be quiet.
Everything about it expresses peace and happiness.
Peace... happiness.
Since I met you, they don't matter.
Peace and happiness no longer matter to me.
It's a shame to rise so early when we're so happy in bed!
Alone in bed, how can I be happy? Why alone?
The castle's full of pretty girls.
Take a look.
And my heart is yours
Will we have the pleasure of Anne's company? I doubt it.
My daughter doesn't enjoy hunting.
You seem troubled. Did you sleep well?
It's been years since that happened.
What a shame, for isn't night made for sleeping?
Did you sleep well, my lady?
I had a marvelous night.
Why so gloomy? It's a joyous day.
Why not invite those two minstrels whose songs you so appreciated?
You didn't seem to appreciate them last night.
I can admit when I'm wrong.
Agnès!
Quickly, dress me!
How kind of you to join us! It's a lovely surprise.
Should not all your pleasures become mine?
I hope you also know hunting songs.
We have songs for every hour of the day – and night.
That minstrel has a peculiar voice, doesn't he?
He's young. He laughs like a child.
Hunting is so sad.
I love birds! Don't worry. No bird shall be caught.
I promise. The birds are my friends, too.
It's strange, you show no fear or surprise at things that surprise others, that frighten them.
Why be frightened?
Life is full of mysteries, isn't it?
A bird, an apple, a beast, the sun, the trees in these woods...
Even us: we don't know from whence we come or where we go.
Isn't that marvelous?
The water is so sweet.
Your lips are sweet, too.
I love you, Anne.
Gilles! What's wrong?
I don't know.
I was so happy, then suddenly, I thought of Renaud.
He also said, "I love you, Anne."
But with the same hard voice in which he says:
"I love my dogs. I love hunting. I love killing whatever flies or leaps."
"I love you, Anne. You'll be mine forever."
Forever.
Is it possible for a person to totally belong to another?
Some call that love.
Then is love like death?
We no longer exist? It's all over?
If you love me, don't hurt me, don't lock me up, let me live!
Love me as I love you – simply.
It's impossible!
What would your daughter say?
And Renaud? Nothing. It is not their place to speak.
When I speak, people listen and remain silent!
I want – Do you hear me?
I want you to take off these men's clothes.
- Right now?
- What are you saying?
Nothing.
You speak, I remain silent. Don't laugh.
I want them to bow to you in awe of your beauty when they see you in a dress.
See me in a dress?
Is that all you desire?
Why tempt a man whose life is over?
Do you cling, like ivy, to your memories?
I implore you...
How can you be so unfeeling?
Do you wish to make me unhappy?
Me?
Make you unhappy?
Since you're here, I feel 20 years younger.
I'm a different man.
Why do you blame me?
I blame you for nothing, dear child.
I'd lost my quarry, so I was looking for you.
Like you, undoubtedly.
Obviously, you wouldn't understand, but...
Dominique, here with us, is a woman.
Truly?
Truly.
She's in grave danger. She requested my protection.
Only you and I know her secret.
Truly?
Truly.
I hear our friends.
We'd better join them.
What game are you playing?
What do you mean?
He kneeled, he kissed your hands.
Don't I deserve homage?
Women like to please.
Dominique! I'm only teasing.
The baron was suspicious.
He questioned me and I answered.
- That's all.
- That's all?
Are you jealous of an old man?
Me, jealous?
Now do you believe that a person can totally belong to another...
- Gilles. - ...without being unhappy?
I'm happy.
And you?
Me?
Why would I be happy?
Because I'm here with you?
Because I held you in my arms?
To me, that's happiness.
Happiness!
How boring!
It's incredible, the only thought in such a pretty head, always the same thought:
Happiness!
It's all so terribly absurd, tragic, monotonous and banal!
What "Gilles"?
What do you want from "Gilles"?
What does "Gilles" mean?
Maybe my name isn't even Gilles!
I beseech you... don't laugh that way!
Such a sad laugh!
Would you rather I burst into tears or roll at your feet because you love me?
I love you and I know you love me too.
Listen carefully.
Anne, my friend,
I don't love you.
Be quiet. It's not true!
You don't know what you're saying!
Please don't look at me that way.
Is it my fault if I've never loved?
- Be quiet.
- Hush!
It isn't worth a single tear, it's nothing but a story invented to amuse the Devil.
Believe me, no one loves anyone.
Everyone pretends!
And happiness – since you believe it exists – might be, especially for you, to avoid those traps.
You're leaving?
Yes.
If you knew how much I love you, you'd have no choice but to love me.
I now reveal this secret, which previously, only Renaud and I knew.
A woman?
Remember, Baron? I noticed this minstrel's "peculiar" voice.
They aren't minstrels.
They are of noble birth and deserve to be honored.
They'll dine at my table, and at the tournament, I'll wear their colors!
- Well said!
- Yes, truly.
Curious story, isn't it?
Were you aware of it?
- No. The young man didn't tell you this afternoon in the woods?
Did the young lady tell you last night in the garden?
During their stay, it is your duty to amuse them.
An easy task, for they seem well-equipped to amuse us.
Why are you so ill-humored?
Why have you suddenly recovered your desire to live?
Is it possible that Dominique is truly your sister?
Such an innocent question...
Answer me.
If Dominique were my sister, do you think I'd squander my time and pleasure to travel with her?
You love her?
To speak truly, she is my only love.
Why take such pleasure in seeing me suffer?
Why?
I knew you loved me!
Alas!
We are under a spell and once it dissipates, you'll see me as I truly am, miserable and alone.
I love you!
I belong to the Devil.
I'm among his friends.
If you love me, it's probably thanks to him.
Why torture yourself like that?
I believed myself utterly alone, yet since I've found you,
I'm even more lost, more alone, more desperate.
To me, you are all the love in the world and all I can bring you is sorrow and despair.
Hold me in your arms.
Once more, tell me you love me.
You are so simple, so young,
so sweet and so alive!
Protect me.
Teach me to live.
Before I met you, I only pretended.
My heart was like ice.
My love, be happy and at peace.
My body is close to yours, your heart beats with mine, our bodies, our hearts are one.
Nothing can ever separate us!
I love you.
And no one – Do you hear?
No one can stop me from loving you!
What strange weather!
It's true!
You should've moved your knight!
Too late. I've made my move.
What is it?
A lord caught in the storm requests hospitality for the night.
Excuse me, I must welcome this unexpected guest.
I'm honored to welcome you to my home.
Thank you.
- You come from afar?
- Very far!
I'm quite a traveler!
The storm caught me by surprise.
I don't fear lightning, but getting soaked to the skin is terribly unpleasant.
Such a lovely fire!
I like fire.
It likes me too. The flames are so attentive.
They lap at my fingers like a hound.
A pleasant sensation!
Forgive me for not introducing myself, although, coming from afar, my name and title mean little to you.
Forgotten in my homeland, unknown abroad, such is the traveler's fate!
But I'm delighted to find myself in such gallant company!
- I hope you'll join us for dinner?
- With pleasure!
Did I interrupt your game?
No matter. I'd lost from the start.
You think so?
Checkmate. You win.
Chess is so simple!
I didn't know your daughter will soon be wed!
Forgive me for intruding on this family occasion!
I hope your fiancé isn't vexed by my ill-timed visit.
Dominique is not my fiancé.
No?
You'd make a lovely couple.
Don't you agree?
You look astonishingly like one of my daughters.
I'm flattered.
- You have daughters?
- Yes!
I have many children, boys and girls, but I must admit, I prefer girls, especially ones like you.
I prefer girls. Boys are ungrateful.
No sense of duty, disobedient.
I'm not a hard man, but I detest...
I detest being disobeyed!
We all have our foibles, don't we?
Tell me, Baron, where is your daughter?
Shall we see her tonight? I doubt it. She's already retired.
I think it's a caprice.
Already?
It's tragic to leave her all alone in her room with her "caprice."
What a shame! I'd have loved to meet her.
Since you resemble my daughter, would you intervene in favor of someone fetching the sweet bride-to-be?
Please, Baron? It'd make me so happy.
What wouldn't I do to make you happy?
Come, Renaud. You'll talk to her.
Why do you laugh?
Why?
How curious!
You laugh, yet don't know why!
Perhaps you laughed simply because it's good to laugh once in a while.
Surely you laughed because you sensed something will happen that's absolutely tragic!
Alas, even the best of us rejoice in the troubles of others!
It's only human.
But you wouldn't have dared to laugh if I hadn't laughed first.
Don't be surprised by my clairvoyance!
I only use my talents for the good of all.
There's no need to peek through keyholes to know what happens in ladies' chambers and men's hearts!
A lady is to wed a young man, but she loves another.
A banal story!
He joins her in her room, but he gets caught!
How sad.
If they are caught together, what happens?
Her lover is beaten, arrested by the guards!
They drag him to the stairs.
He stumbles, then gets up, only to fall under more blows!
This man has odiously abused my hospitality. He will be punished.
- You summoned me?
- This man is a dog!
Treat him as such! So be it.
Chain him up with the other dogs!
Not a bad start!
How can I ever forgive you for this?
And you, sire, do you hold the sister responsible for her brother's crimes?
My heart is in shreds.
Your suffering pains me.
Forgive me, we've just met, but it's sad to see you in such a state.
Let's stroll in the garden.
The fresh air will do you good.
I don't know why, but that man scares me.
I'm glad you don't blame this young woman for her brother's unfortunate conduct.
It's the mark of a generous soul and a chivalrous heart.
She's so fortunate to have found here all the affection she deserves.
- We care for her a lot. - Quite right!
She merits every respect.
And why not love?
What a pretty ring!
May I?
I adore jewelry.
Marvelous craftsmanship.
Judge for yourself.
This initial, this D!
It's so finely engraved, this D!
Don't you agree?
Who are you?
How did you get in?
I'm the Devil!
I could care less.
What?
Don't you understand?
I'm the Devil!
Yes, the Devil.
How else can I be here and elsewhere at once?
Yes, elsewhere.
For example, in the garden.
If Dominique loves me, what can you do about it?
Absolutely nothing!
Please, there's no need for violence!
What's so marvelous about that?
I'm here, locked in my room, but am I not also at the fountain where my beloved held me in his arms?
You speak like a child, for you don't know my power.
Just watch.
- You're jealous, that's all!
- Me?
It's written all over your face.
"Dominique, what wouldn't I do to make you happy? "
You cling to her skirts, cater to her whims.
You smile like a kind father, but your eyes betray your desire!
Wretch!
What's wretched and laughable is an old man begging for love!
You shouldn't have done that.
Gentlemen!
Surely you won't kill each other in the garden, under your daughter's window?
You're right.
- Tomorrow we shall duel as knights.
- To the death!
Excellent idea!
If something terrible should happen, everyone will consider it an unfortunate accident.
- It's awful!
- Not at all!
Nothing will befall your father. I'll watch over him.
Leave me alone.
I'm not listening. For me, you don't exist.
Maybe not for you, but for others...
Gilles, for example.
Poor, miserable Gilles.
Be quiet.
Gilles is no longer miserable.
He'll never be miserable because we love each other.
Rejoice, Gilles! It seems you're miserable no more!
Here you are, chained up like a dog, waiting for the executioner to rip out your nails, gorge you with water, sew your eyelids shut, break a few bones!
Naturally, none of this will trouble your happiness, the glorious happiness of love.
It's true. I'm happy.
Poor fool! You won't get away with it.
That'd be too easy!
If you possess someone even once, they belong to me forever!
Do what you will with me, but Anne belongs to no one.
She is free.
You have no power over her.
You think she's all yours?
For always?
Poor Gilles, look what you're reduced to!
A brilliant boy like you, caught in the pitiful traps of love.
You should know better. Want an example?
This place is full of them. Listen, instead.
Can't you hear the Baron tiptoeing through the castle?
Excuse me, I was simply passing by.
Returning to my room after a moonlight stroll.
Lovely night, isn't it?
I couldn't sleep.
So I got up and went for a walk.
I understand completely.
I sleep like a baby, so I pity those who don't.
Excuse me, Baron, but I'm exhausted.
Good night.
I'm grateful you didn't hide this from me, but now I'm frantic with worry.
I'm afraid to lose you.
Death in a duel is simple and swift, with barely time to suffer and none to think.
I admire how you speak of death so lightly!
I'm not talking of my own death.
Since I met you,
I'm filled with a ferocious lust for life.
A life with you.
With me, close to me.
In your arms, forever.
When the Baron struck me, I lost all respect for him.
Tomorrow, after the duel, we'll run away together.
Truly?
You'd abandon everything for me?
Once the Baron is dead, do you think I'd stay here with Anne and your brother's lovesick wailing under our window each night?
Please, don't talk about poor Gilles!
I'm already so afraid... for your life. Don't add to my pain.
Have no fear.
Look how fine the links are in this Italian chain mail!
Here we can't make them this pretty or this strong.
With this and a bit of luck, even the worst blows can't harm me.
A fine proof of love, if you're in no danger!
Don't you see?
It's only to reassure you. I'd fight bare-chested if you wished it.
I fear no man, nor the Devil, nor death!
"Nor the Devil, nor death."
You please me well, Renaud.
So confident, so dangerous!
Tomorrow, wear this under your doublet.
You'll remember the warmth of my body as you fight to keep me.
Anne, my love, my true love!
Anne, you are as beautiful as the day!
I love you madly!
Give me your lips!
Leave me alone.
You aren't Gilles.
- What? You aren't Gilles.
You look like Gilles, you have his voice, but Gilles would never say such things.
If you say so. Then who am I?
It's easy to guess.
You're the one who came yesterday.
You called yourself the Devil, the Demon, the Deceiver.
Since you can't be fooled...
It's true, you are the Deceiver.
You may even deceive yourself.
There are some things that escape you.
Escape me?
Poor idiot! Nothing escapes me.
No one can escape me, not even you!
You don't know my powers!
I hold the world in my hands!
That's right! Storms, rain, hail, wind, shipwrecks: that's me!
Sickness, war and all its pleasures, pestilence, famine, misery, murder, hatred, jealousy.
That's me, always me!
And death.
Me, again!
With such an existence, I can see why you're not happy!
Me, not happy?
I'm so easily amused!
I find the troubles of this world most entertaining.
They warm my heart, make me laugh.
Yes, they make me laugh. But I hate laughing by myself.
Do you hear me?
Why don't you answer?
What are you thinking of, wretch?
A song my governess once sang, she said it was the fairies –
I detest fairies!
I detest stories like that!
When the two lovers' hearts
Beat as one
Enough!
If you ever sing that again, I'll turn you to stone!
Even if you turned me into a hag, or a dead serpent, it wouldn't matter to me because my love would still live.
"Her love."
She dares mention her love!
Don't forget, treacherous creature, that you've done wrong.
If it's a sin to give myself to the one I love,
I don't regret it.
Truly?
You should be ashamed! Ashamed?
Why?
I don't even know what shame is!
Shame... is what we hide.
If you're not ashamed of your love, why not shout it from the rooftops?
Why not tell the whole town?
Why not?
Listen!
I've been locked in this room to keep me from the one I love.
I've no wish to wound anyone, but I love Gilles.
Not only do I love him,
I have but one desire:
to be near him, to share his fate, for better or for worse.
"For worse."
You can count on that, dear girl.
The sin of scandal is the greatest sin.
Your poor daughter must be possessed by a demon!
Poor Anne.
It breaks my heart to treat her like this, but as the shame was public, so must be the punishment.
Sad lost children
We wander through the night
Where are day's blooms?
Love's pleasures?
Life's radiance?
Sad lost children
We wander through the night
The Devil treacherously whisks us away
The Devil whisks us away
Our youth is dust
And our loves too
How beautiful to hear it sung with such sadness!
It melts my heart.
It's true, and I enjoy it.
Sing some more, for me.
You don't want to?
You don't want to hurt me, to make me cry, to make me as tender as a little lamb?
Too bad!
You're determined not to please me.
So be it!
But take heed, I'll be back.
Renaud ordered me to modify your face and body so terribly
that no woman will ever love you!
Forget such things.
Close your eyes, like I close mine.
Forget your chains.
Take me to our fountain.
It's so like you to forget your chains, to take refuge in happy memories!
Alas, I am here!
I have no ill intentions.
Memories are lovely, but the past is gone forever!
The present is what counts and right now, some surprising things are happening!
Look how clear the water is, like a cloudless sky.
What silence!
A deathly silence.
A grand tournament. Lovely ladies, fine weather, noble lords.
There's your humble servant, seated on Dominique's right.
What a show!
Everyone is enjoying it.
Gilles, they'll fight to the death, I know it.
It's true, one of them must die.
As a favor, I'll let you decide.
Give me a name.
Don't answer. There's no point. He's already decided.
You see?
A little blood can ruin the clearest water!
You should get some rest.
You're exhausted.
Renaud...
I already considered him as a son.
This is the hand that struck him...
These things happen.
It was just bad luck. He died at my hand.
Bells, always bells!
What an odd custom!
Yes, a man is dead, but why make so much noise?
Those bells are exasperating!
And Baron Hugues!
Poor Baron, isn't he exasperating with his empty words, his suffering, his remorse, his heavy sighs?
Dominique, you should take him away.
Where?
I don't know. Anywhere.
To the Devil, as they say! Out of my sight, out of everyone's sight!
It'd be pleasant to stay here for a while.
And Anne...
What do you think of her?
She's a charming creature, isn't she?
I've never seen anyone like her.
Do you think she really loves Gilles?
If she loves him, she's capable of loving someone else.
Who?
Are you jealous, my dear?
I was a child when you met me.
You know I'm incapable of suffering.
I feel no pain, no joy, no pleasure.
Is it really necessary for me to take this old man away?
Yes, his time has come.
He's lived long enough. He's had his fill.
It's a shame.
I'd have preferred to take the other one.
At least he was young.
You shouldn't take these affairs so seriously.
They're as old as the world, and just as worn out.
Yes, it'd be very pleasant indeed.
Anne... may your chains fall.
Appear in the garden, on this bench.
What's going on?
Never happened before...
Finally!
You kept me waiting, dear.
You know I'm not here of my own will.
I'm so terribly sorry, but do me the pleasure of sitting with me.
Please don't cry!
It hurts to see such a pretty face twisted in sorrow.
Leave me alone.
My heart is sad, so sad.
I'm not used to unhappiness and now Gilles is in prison, threatened by the executioner,
Renaud is dead, and my father is in despair.
Could you be the cause of all these troubles?
What do you expect?
No one loves me.
I amuse myself as best I can.
If you only knew how sensitive I am, how the slightest thing wounds me!
Whenever there's a new joy in the world, or a new love shines, you can't imagine my suffering!
I'd cry... if only I had tears.
I assure you, if someone loved me, it'd help so much.
Life would be so easy and pleasant if only you tried to understand me.
Truly, the love Gilles offers is derisory!
Whereas I...
But that's quite impossible, for I love Gilles.
Gilles! What use is he?
Do you think he hears you?
Yes, he hears me because I love him.
Anne, have no fear. I love you!
Don't listen to him!
He has no power over you!
Anne, my love!
My life!
Alas, I fear my poor brother has lost his wits.
It's possible.
Sometimes I think I'm losing mine.
My guilty love for you made me kill Renaud.
Why are you dressed like that?
I'm leaving.
I feel guilty, too.
And yet, my wrongdoing was involuntary.
Who can blame you for being beautiful and desirable?
You don't know the whole truth.
Renaud fought without chain mail to please me.
That's why your blow killed him.
How horrible!
Why did you do it?
You have to ask?
I believed Renaud quicker and stronger than you.
I feared the worst, I feared losing you.
Dominique. Yes, my lord,
I did it out of love for you.
You say you love me, yet you are leaving?
I must go.
My life is yours now.
You know I can't allow you to go alone.
Wherever you go, I'll go.
Alas, my lord, how could I ask you to abandon everything for me?
Don't forget your promise, my lord. "Wherever you go, I'll go."
You'll be mine because you love Gilles and it's the only way to save him.
If I wish, I can make him the most miserable creature in the world!
Impossible! Surely, you couldn't?
Yes!
I can transform him into any horrible thing I choose!
No, I beg you!
I can also make him forget you and send him on his way, carefree, without memories or regrets.
Alive, like everyone else.
He can't forget me.
Everyone forgets! He'll forget immediately.
You'll forget later. But I don't want to! If he forgets me, I'll never love another.
You prefer the company of a monster who remembers you?
At heart, I'm not a bad devil.
I can make you happy, believe me.
Your every wish will be my command.
I have only one wish:
to return to Gilles in the prison where he calls me.
- Be quiet! - I want to be with Gilles.
Anne... Can't you hear him calling?
She makes a fool of me!
And yet, I love her!
I was too sweet, too obliging.
That's no way to win a woman! All that will change!
Why so sad, Anne?
Look at me, think of me
as if it were the last time.
What do you mean?
Nothing.
I don't know.
I love you so much that I fear one day you'll forget me.
Forget you?
But, Anne, I'd rather forget to breathe, forget to live...
I hope I'm not disturbing you!
Excuse me.
I'm waiting for your answer. I don't know the question, but don't answer.
It's a trap.
Nothing keeps you here, dear child, now that your father is gone.
- My father?
- Don't worry about him!
He left with Dominique.
All's well that ends well.
There is a slight age difference.
But what does it matter? They love one another.
Enough about them. Let's talk about us.
And him.
Since he still interests you...
Be quiet!
Leave her alone!
I know my fate is in your hands, but what do I care?
I love her and you have no power over her.
How do you know?
Anne, let's talk seriously.
Gilles wrote this himself and signed it in his own hand with his blood.
It was wrong, but he did it.
It's too late now.
Give me your answer.
If I say yes to you, he'll be free forever?
As free as a bird, like a fish in the water.
Don't listen to him!
Please, Anne.
Will you accept to follow me, to try to love me?
Yes.
Finally!
What gorgeous sunshine!
And what a lovely castle!
What? I'm imprisoned?
No, you're not.
You're free, totally free!
That's much better!
Can you tell me where we are, who this castle belongs to?
Is it yours?
It doesn't matter! I've no wish to know you.
I don't like how you smile at me.
Anyway, none of this matters.
I feel like laughing, for I'm alive!
The sun is shining, what more could I want?
You're so beautiful!
One only sees such creatures in dreams.
You're the prettiest girl in the world.
Why are you so sad?
- This is no place for you.
- Is she your daughter?
No, she's not my daughter.
I understand, and I understand her sorrow.
Life can be unfair.
Youth should be spent with other youths.
Perhaps she loves you.
Anyway, it doesn't concern me.
Excuse me.
I kept my promise.
You're mine now. Forever!
No.
What do you mean, "No"?
I can't believe it!
You promised.
You swore.
I lied.
That's impossible.
You don't know how.
You couldn't lie!
All the same, I lied. That's the truth.
It's impossible!
Anne, pure as snow, clearer than spring water,
Anne, the only person in the world I trusted!
Why did you do such a thing?
How dare you!
All's fair in love.
To save Gilles, I'd have done much worse.
I've lost him.
I'll never love again.
And yet, without recognizing me, he found me beautiful and told me so.
Be quiet!
If you keep talking like that, there's no telling what I'll do!
Do whatever you wish, but please, let me return once more to the fountain where I was happy.
So be it.
Is that you?
What luck has led me here?
Are you alone?
Yes.
The old man with you is gone?
Yes.
Now I'm even happier.
Are you thirsty?
The water is so sweet!
Your lips are sweet, too.
My love.
I knew I couldn't lose you.
Get away from him!
No.
Nothing can separate us now.
For the last time, get away from him!
To stone, do you hear me?
I'll turn you to stone!
The silence I adore...
Deathly silence.
What's that?
What's that noise?
It's their hearts!
Their hearts beating!
Still beating!
Beating!
This picture you're about to see is the first cinematic study of the preparation, arrival and establishment of permanent cover for secret agents.
We're fortunate in having with us for this occasion Colonel Robinson, Chief of Schools and Training.
Colonel, before we start the picture, perhaps you wouldn't mind saying a few words.
All right, Lieutenant.
I will make this short because I know that you are all just as anxious to see this movie as I am.
I wished that it were possible for me to meet all of you men personally, but since it isn't, I'll take this opportunity to say hello and to tell you that I'm glad you're with us.
Many of you are going to desks in this country or to assignments in neutral countries where you may not be faced with the problems portrayed in this film.
But if this brings you just a little closer to those men who are going into the hottest spots,
I hope that it will help you to do a better job.
This picture does not presume to give you all of the answers, of course.
I do think, however, that it will provide a foundation on which to do your own building.
For after all, no more service provides a greater scope for individual initiative and imagination than this job for which you have volunteered.
All right, Lieutenant, take it away.
Thank you, Colonel. Okay, Al, let her go.
Yes, this is an undercover agent-- at least, the popular conception of how such a fellow looks and behaves.
He is inconspicuous.
He blends with his environment.
He is, in short, the ideal agent...
from the enemy's point of view.
He's just the kind of agent the enemy is waiting for with open arms, and for that reason, just the kind of agent you aren't going to be.
-Student Al?
-Right.
You seem to have made a good impression at the schools. Nice work.
Thank you, sir.
Pull up a chair.
Cigarette?
Thanks.
I think you were told something about your assignment before you went, weren't you, Al?
Yes, to obtain intelligence on aviation production and the position of vital targets in the capital district of Enemy Area.
Correct.
You're to set up an intelligence organization which will gather information for an S.O. operation.
Are you set on your cover?
Not definitely. I've narrowed it down to two:
either a government inspector or a chief mechanic.
Government inspector.
Better for a native agent than a planted one.
In these days, when Enemy Area is using every available man under 50 in the army, people might wonder what special pull you had.
Anything that makes people ask questions, even innocent ones, is bad cover.
Then you think the mechanic's the better bet?
If you're a good mechanic.
You know nothing will blow you quicker than not knowing your job.
Well, I put in seven years with General Motors.
With a little brushing up, I think I'd be all right.
A mechanic in an airplane plant near the capital.
That might be the ticket.
We know they need good mechanics so badly now, that it might not take you too long to establish good permanent cover.
Now if I could get a job on the night shift,
I'd have plenty of time to devote to my hobby during the day.
Good.
I like the way you're thinking.
Now go to work.
The background's familiar to you.
You'll be able to get the latest material at the Farm, the most recent laws and local restrictions, even the latest slang our intelligence has picked up.
I've already made up a list of things to check off. If there's anything you don't get, that you think you need, the door is always open. Good.
And by the way, I'll get right to work on those financial details for you.
Hope to have that insurance for your family pushed through before you leave.
That's very kind of you.
No, it's not kind.
It's my job to do everything I can to help you think about nothing but your job.
Well, I'll let you know when I'm ready.
Right.
-Good morning. -Good morning.
I'm Student Charles.
Lawyer, eh?
Pretty good cover.
Thank you. Sit down.
I've been going over your evaluation from the schools.
Oh, that stuff.
I've spent enough time on the other side to know my way around.
That's what you told them after they took your pants off at their Thursday night roundtable.
If you set me down in a real spot, it'll be another story.
We're considering you for a real spot.
We're trying to establish a man in one of Enemy Area's chief seaports, to observe the naval concentration there and to find out whether or not there's a submarine base in that vicinity.
Now you could do it, if you went in with the right attitude.
Look, if you think I've got the ability, don't worry about my attitude.
Which port is it?
El Porto.
El Porto?
My old stomping grounds.
I could draw that coast with my eyes closed.
Well, this job calls for you going in with your eyes open.
Now you know the locale all right, but that isn't enough to get by.
Now think it over and come back when you're ready to talk cover.
I'm ready now.
El Porto, let me see...
I've got it! A fishing boat skipper.
I've raced around there enough to know the channels by heart.
Hmm... fishing has possibilities, and we have a lot of contacts with fishermen around there, you know, who could probably take care of you.
Then it's all set.
No, it's just something to consider now, and if it doesn't hurt your feelings, we'd like to bust you from skipper to an ordinary seaman.
You know, every skipper is known to the shore patrol there, but if you were just a member of the crew, like the thousands are in every seaport, you might get by with it.
Get by with it?
I talk the language like a native.
I know those waters better than most natives.
How can I miss? Very easily.
By going on like you've been going-- by knowing all the answers before you even think of the questions.
Now, we'll give you all the dope you require about this El Porto area, but just don't read it, absorb it.
Okay, if you want to waste time, but I tell you I know El Porto like a book.
Perhaps the enemy has added a couple of chapters since you've left.
Aye, aye, sir.
So you're all set on your story, eh?
Well, I'd like to try it out on you.
All right, shoot.
Let's see how closely it conforms to your own life.
And don't forget...
I'll be watching for errors as closely as an enemy police officer.
Here it is.
My name is Albert Horn.
Both my parents were born in Enemy Area, and they lived in Detroit for five years when I was born there in 1903.
I was in Detroit until 1913, when my mother died and I was sent back to live with my aunt and uncle in the capital of Enemy Area.
I graduated from the Gymnasium in 1920 and went to work in my uncle's bicycle shop.
In 1924, I went back to Detroit and worked as an apprentice in the Ford plant.
In 1926, I transferred to General Motors, where I worked as a machinist until 1931.
From 1931, I was on relief until 1936, when I went back to my old job at General Motors.
Just before my home country went into the war,
I felt it was my duty to return there and serve in any way I could.
Arriving there on a U.S. tourist passport,
I volunteered with the engineers, and then after a year and three months in the army,
I'm discharged with a bad back.
Ever had a bad back?
No, but I thought I could fake it.
Never say anything you can't prove.
That's one ailment the best doctor in the world can't prove you haven't got.
Okay, sciatica.
I convalesced for a short time in the country, at a friend's house.
That will be the farmhouse you're taken to by the reception committee.
And then when I'm directed to find employment in an aircraft factory because of my technical experience,
I come to the capital and make arrangements for an interview with the superintendent of a Falcon plant.
Sounds all right, Al.
That story ought to stand up.
It's a little glib, perhaps, but it isn't bad.
Now you talk a good fisherman, now you've got to learn to be a good fisherman.
The next thing on the agenda is a couple of weeks with a commercial fisherman on the Grand Banks.
Won't I stink enough of fish on the other side without having to get a two-week start?
Oh, it isn't a question of stinking like a fisherman, although that's important, too.
You've got to know the ropes-- literally, I mean.
But I'm a fisherman from way back.
Why, I landed the biggest sailfish ever caught in Mexican waters back in '33, a hundred and eighty-nine pounds.
You can look it up in the record book.
I'd rather read the records in your hands. Let me see your palms.
Good callouses.
I think a couple weeks of saltwater and hard work will really get you in shape.
But I've got to have some relaxation.
After all, I'm not going abroad for my health.
And it's my neck.
Now that's where you're wrong.
Once you join our team, it isn't a question of your own neck anymore.
Those brains of yours are a vital connection point in our system of intelligence.
When one fuse is blown, the lights go out all over the house.
So, we're just as interested in safeguarding that neck of yours as you are.
You don't know how that goddamn line goes!
Come on, do it right.
Whether you're checked before you leave, or on the other side, the principle is always the same.
The most unimportant detail may be the most important.
When you get your hair cut, be sure it's Enemy Area style.
The hands must look as if they've done the work.
Every scar must conform with your cover story.
Clothes may not necessarily make the agent, but they surely break the agent if they aren't checked and rechecked.
That's an Enemy Area cut, all right, but it's too expensive for a mechanic.
Well, that's the type of coat you would wear, but there aren't any left.
That's right. The army got all the heavy coats in the last winter drive.
How about that one?
I think this raincoat will be better.
Every piece of clothing is examined for the right labels, the right laundry marks, the proper amount of wear and tear.
Every toilet article examined minutely.
How about this razor?
They use straight razors over there now because of the shortage of blades.
Even if your papers have been forged by experts, from the most recent Enemy Area documents, proof them yourselves.
Just a minute.
This army discharge reads "Alfred Horn."
Everything else is "Albert Horn."
Nice eye, Al. Just wanted to see if you were on the ball.
You don't have to worry about the rest of those papers.
Even the texture and water marks have been duplicated.
Just as important as your official papers, and more subtle to select, are your casual effects, the odds and ends you happen to have with you that may be more convincing to the Enemy Area police than your identification and travel permit--
the stickers on your suitcase, a handful of cigarettes, a train stub, an old address book, a letter addressed to you as a private in the army, from a girl in the town you're going to,
and a snapshot of her with you in an Enemy Area uniform.
Details-- each one a thread woven into the pattern of your cover story.
How many cases of blown cover you studied were due to neglect of some insignificant detail of cover that didn't seem worth checking a second time?
Jolly, jolly sixpence
I've got sixpence to last me all my life
I've got twopence to spend and twopence to lend
And two pence to take home to my wife
This is German agent X.
He landed in Canada from a submarine two days ago.
So far, he's doing all right for himself.
His landlady believes he's a war worker from out west, in British Columbia.
This afternoon his forged papers and his convincing line got him a job in an aluminum plant.
No wonder he feels like joining in the singing.
Of the silvery moon
Happy is the day when we line up for our pay
As we go rolling, rolling home
Say, that's not bad. Come on over and join us, will you?
Don't mind if I do.
I got fourpence, jolly, jolly fourpence
I got fourpence to last me all my life
I got twopence to spend and twopence to lend
And no pence to send home to my wife Poor wife
No cares have...
That's very funny.
Let's all have another beer.
Thanks, but it's getting late. I'd better be going.
Aw, don't be a killjoy. We're just beginning to wet our whistles.
I'd like to have another drink with you boys, but I gotta be on the job at the crack of dawn.
Good night, fellas.
-We'll see you again.
-So long.
-What's the damage?
-That'll be $1.80, sir. That's easy.
Keep the change.
-Thanks.
Come again.
Hey, will you look at this?
What have you got there, Peg?
One of those old bills the government called in before the war.
Gee, I haven't seen one of these big fellas in a long time.
Now where the devil do you suppose he got this?
Yes, Agent X was doing all right for himself, until he passed an obsolete bill, one-third larger than the present issue.
Months of preparation were nullified by insufficient attention to what seemed like an insignificant detail.
Carelessness, conspicuousness, blown cover:
That's the fatal triple-play that put German Agent X out of the game.
Agent Y was a smooth operator, a Spanish Falangist who had turned in a good job for the Nazis in Mexico before moving on to Los Angeles to incite Mexican youths against other Americans and recruit the keenest of them into an espionage organization.
He had not been in Los Angeles long, but long enough to win friends and influence zoot-suiters.
Come on, kids, I got paid today. Have another shot.
Brother, this tequila is murder.
What the hell?
The army's getting you next week anyway.
What have you got to lose?
Just his stomach, that's all.
Hey, muchacho.
Another round? Are you kidding?
You know that time it is?
The bar's closed.
Here's a buck for yourself.
Maybe that will help keep the bar open for one more round.
Say, you're really a killer, aren't you?
What do you mean calling me a killer?
Killer diller.
Trying to buy me off for a lousy buck, when the state commission fines me five hundred for selling after hours.
Oh, I see...killer.
That's an expression you use, huh?
Say, how long you been in L.A.?
Oh, I don't know. Three or four years.
Where'd you live before that, Juanito?
Uh, San Bernardino. Come on, let's get out of here.
What's the nickname for San Bernardino?
What is this, a third degree?
Since when do customers have to answer questions by stupid waiters?
Come on, muchachos.
Everyone who lives there knows the nickname of San Bernardino, brother.
San Berdoo.
Anybody that never heard of a killer diller.
The waiter was anti-Falangist and anti-Nazi.
From that moment on, he kept his eyes on Senor Y.
He began to notice other idiomatic slips.
When his suspicions were passed over to the authorities, they were quickly confirmed.
And the enemy lost a clever agent, but not quite clever enough to remember that even details of slang are a necessary part of his cover equipment.
Uh, what company did you say you worked for in Copenhagen?
The Hausenfar Dairy Company.
And what is your exact position with this company?
I'm the assistant foreign branch manager in Germany.
British Agent Z has made repeated trips to Germany under convincing commercial cover.
Even when he was picked up for making a somewhat suspicious call to Copenhagen, his story was unshaken.
And the way he was presenting it was even beginning to influence the expert interrogators of the S.S.
Christien Dairies, Incorporated.
And what is the address of this company in Copenhagen?
Gentlemen, I'd be very glad to answer your questions all day, but I have a good many business details to complete before leaving your city, and I'm quite sure you have many more important things to do.
One moment, please.
We are not interested in persecuting Danes.
Security police is not an organization of persecution.
It is an organization that protects you against the enemies of the state.
If you are guilty, you will not escape us.
If you are who you say you are, you have nothing to fear from us.
Then I have your permission to leave?
Yes, you may go.
Thank you.
Pardon me, Captain.
You see? Hair grease.
If my memory is correct, there has been no hair grease on the Continent since the end of 1940.
This is preposterous.
Quiet!
Have a sample of this hair grease analyzed immediately.
You will be kept in solitary confinement pending the report from the laboratory.
Come along!
So you have not been in England since 1938, eh?
Then how do you account for the fact that this hair grease is a British product, which has been applied...
A first-rate cover story, and an excellent man destroyed by a few drops of hair dressing, thoughtlessly rubbed into his hair during his last trip to England a few days before.
Months of training, final weeks of thorough briefing, and our agents are ready for the second leg of their journey, on to base country.
Charles, in a heavy bomber, under temporary military cover, while Al crosses as a private on a common transport.
In a fashionable apartment in a base country capital,
Al locates his desk.
You seem pretty well prepared, on the whole.
You'll have a formal briefing as soon as you lose your sea legs.
Thank you.
We picked up some of the latest changes in Enemy Area regulations that may alter your documentation a little.
I wish they'd quit making new regulations every day. I'd sleep better.
Well, from their point of view, they think they're being very clever.
If they keep changing the rules every five minutes, a newcomer can't stay hidden very long, theoretically.
But we've found that by keeping our eyes open, and using our heads, we can beat that game.
For instance, don't go into a strange bar and order the first thing that pops in your head.
Your favorite poison may be on the verboten list that day.
Look around, and see what the others are drinking.
Then if you're stuck, appear undecided so long that the waiter will suggest something for you.
Just remember, this is no suicide mission.
It's a 24-hour a day job, where the odds are all in your favor, and to make sure of that, I always tell my men to take out life insurance.
I think that's been taken care of back in the--
No, I mean your own personal life insurance... by leaving open some avenue of escape in case things get too hot for you.
Study your means of exfiltration just as carefully as infiltration.
I've known men who were expert drivers in first, second, and high, but who never knew how to go into reverse.
Don't worry. I'm not the hero type.
Good.
But just, uh, how do you go about leaving this, uh, avenue of escape?
Well, in the first place, have a cover story ready for that emergency exit.
As soon as possible, hide a cache of money somewhere.
And when you start building your organization, keep contacts whose only function is to help your getaway.
In other words, when I buy this ticket for Enemy Area, you want me to make sure it's a roundtrip ticket.
In another base country, Charles is concentrating on last-minute details of his infiltration into Enemy Area.
What's your name?
S-Sanford!
Sanford?
It's a good thing I'm just your base country desk, not an Enemy Area plainclothesman.
From now on, your name is Charles Santos.
The next time you give your right name, you may find your interrogator just a little less cooperative.
Christ, this is a hell of way--
Listen, there's less chance of having your sleep interrupted later on if you get to know your new name better than your old.
Aw, it's practically second nature with me now, it's just that I--
Tomorrow, you'd better concentrate on nothing but that name.
Drink it, eat it, walk around with it until you know it well enough to come up with it out of a sound sleep.
Okay, okay.
Good night, Charles Santos.
Now, there are three or four different ways we can send agents into Enemy Area.
They can go overland, either overtly, under good legal cover, or covertly, sneaking across the border with the help of the underground.
An agent traveling overtly would have to pass as a national from a neutral country under some sort of commercial cover.
When you're crossing a border this way, you should not only act as if you have nothing to hide, you should actually have nothing to hide.
Don't bring compromising materials or messages through these controls.
They can be sent to you more safely by other methods once you're established in Enemy Area.
If you're crossing the border covertly, as thousands are doing in Europe these days, don't carry a map with you.
It's unhealthy, unless you carry it in your own head.
Memorize the principle landmarks and the basic topography of the area you're entering, until you can make your own model of the country on the sand table.
If a guide is necessary, be sure you check his reliability.
Members of the underground are your best bet.
Professionals who charge you exorbitant prices are loyal to only one cause, money, and the enemy loot may be just as bright as yours.
Borders breed double agents, who charge you a thousand dollars to lead you over the border, and, being eminently fair, charge the enemy an equal amount to lead them to you.
If you're worried about doubling back on yourself, use your ingenuity in fashioning an impromptu chart of your course, camouflaged as harmless doodling.
After you're crossed the frontier, don't get overconfident about those border controls.
You're in a 24-hour a day battle of wits, and the enemy has secret weapons of his own.
Keep moving across country by a circuitous route, for the border isn't a black thread across the map, it's a strip at least fifteen miles wide, infested with collaborationists, counter-espionage agents, and special police--
human landmines hidden among the native population to blast your cover.
And finally, when you reach a town far enough inland, don't enter it from the border side.
Circle around it and enter it from the other side, as if you were coming from the interior.
But as I understood it, I was going in by plane.
Yes, in your case, it will be safer and faster to drop you by parachute.
We like our men to have a good working knowledge of other methods of penetration.
How about these plane landings I've heard of?
Naturally, when we have a field that we can land on safely without being discovered, it's more efficient.
We can pick up an outgoing agent at the same time, for instance.
But the only place we can land on safely now is guerrilla territory.
How low is this plane gonna be when I jump?
Maybe it would be a good idea for you to sit down with the pilot who's going to fly you in.
He'll give you the dope on just how it's going to be.
And another thing, we never set a date until we're damn sure we found the right dropping point, like this one we've picked out for you, for instance.
It's just about perfect.
It's a little grassy space large enough to allow for adverse wind conditions... and it's far enough removed from trees and telegraph wires so that daylight won't find you hanging out there like an ornament on a Christmas tree.
It's fifteen miles to the nearest anti-aircraft setup, and my buddies will create a little diversion over there to keep their minds off us until we've set you down.
There's a river running closely that I can follow practically all the way in, and a couple of little lakes on the other side that make pretty good landmarks to help me spot the place in the moonlight.
About a mile away from the dropping point, there's a safe house owned by a peasant working with us.
A liaison chief will be there waiting for you.
Everything's on schedule.
How soon will they be here?
Thirty-three minutes.
Take the radio out and bury it, Mary.
The container being dropped with Al is bulky evidence of Al's arrival, unless it can be buried deep enough and fast enough, for empty containers, buried instantly, tell no tales.
Right on time.
Let's go.
He's gonna drop on the other side of the field. Come on.
Any broken bones?
No, I think I made it all in one piece.
Our friend's farm is up the hill there, just about a mile.
I'll show you the way.
What about my, uh, gear?
-Don't worry, the boys'll take care of it.
-Fine. Let's go.
While Al enjoys a much-needed rest,
Charles employs another method of infiltration in reaching Enemy Area coasts.
A neutral fishing schooner and itinerant fishermen-- both familiar sights to this waterfront town-- provide the most natural sort of cover for Charles' arrival.
Can you pick him out? No?
I'm afraid the Enemy Area shore patrol could.
What's that stroke of yours, Charles?
Look around at the others-- short, jerky strokes.
Not the most graceful in the world, but better adapted to choppy surf and heavy boats.
Now look at yours.
Long, sweeping strokes.
Where do you think you are, Charlie?
Back in the dear old Harvard shell?
Yes, just a detail, but the kind of detail the enemy shore patrol is watching for.
Wait a minute, there, Charles.
How about that knot?
Don't tell me you've forgotten the fishermen here have their own particular method of tying up a boat.
Keep your eyes open and your mind open, Charles.
Otherwise, you're liable to tie that knot around your own neck.
As soon as curfew is lifted,
Al hits the road to the nearest railway terminal.
Ask him where he's coming from, and he'd say...
"From the farm where I was convalescing, after I was evacuated from the bombed city of Faubourg.
And where was he going?
To Enemy Town, to visit my fiancée and try to get a part-time job until I'm strong enough to get into a war plan.
Oh, boy, maybe I can get a hitch to the station.
Wait a minute, Al.
What did they tell you about cars in Enemy Area?
Nine out of ten, they're state officials, just the boys who might ask embarrassing questions.
Better hoof it, brother.
It's better to find a hole in your shoe than a hole in your cover.
That's right, whistle. Be as natural as you can.
But just a second. What's that you're whistling?
"Wait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie"?
That's better. A Viennese waltz.
They weren't kidding when they told you at the schools that this was a 24-hour a day job.
Even what you whistle has to conform to cover.
So far, so good, Al.
You're not taking the bus because the police are watching the buses pretty carefully these days.
Instead, as soon as Enemy Area restrictions allow daylight travel, you've located the first rural station in the opposite direction from the dropping point.
Travel permits. Let's see your travel permits.
That's it, Al.
Sit back and take this snap control in stride.
You've left all compromising material behind to be sent to you later at a previously arranged address, and you know your temporary cover story for this trip holds water because you tested it for leaks at the farmhouse last night.
What's your name?
Albert Horn.
Where are you coming from?
A farm near Faubourg.
A farm, huh?
You don't look like a farmer. I'm not.
I was evacuated after being bombed out of a hospital in Faubourg.
Where are you headed?
Enemy Town.
Sorry to ask you so many questions, but an unidentified plane flew over the neighborhood last night, and we can't take any chances.
Why are you going to Enemy Town?
I can show you.
Hmm... not bad.
My fiancée.
I wouldn't mind going to Enemy Town for that myself.
Oh, it's my patriotic duty.
Patriotic duty, huh?
I wish all our patriotic duties could be so pleasant.
In Enemy Town, halfway between the dropping point and the capital,
Al heads for the address he was given by the liaison chief.
Mr. Durand?
Yes.
Someone told me you were looking for an assistant.
An assistant? I could use an assistant.
How much experience have you had?
I was a mechanic in the army, two years in the tank corps. Good.
I've been looking for a man with your kind of training.
Then I'm your man.
-Got your work clothes with you?
-Right here in my bag. Good.
Come on inside, and I'll start you right to work.
Thank you, sir.
Over the noise of the machines,
Durand gives Al the necessary instructions for the last leg of his journey to the capital.
No, not like that. You're throwing away too much.
Nowadays, they take four-fifths of our catch, so we use this for chowder.
A foreman sees you throwing this away, and they wonder where you were when they warned you about it four weeks ago.
Oh, I'll just tell them I was out of town that day for my old lady's funeral.
I can see you're a very brave man.
If you don't mind my saying so, you're too spirited.
Look at these fellas around you.
They are half dead from hunger and sadness.
They must work twice as hard, for half as much.
Their sons are taken away from them, and their children die.
Their will to live is very weak.
Only men like us are not broken yet.
But we must appear beaten, too, so as not to stand out from the others.
Remember the agent's first commandment, Charles.
Don't be conspicuous.
Good cover doesn't come automatically with the right clothes.
You must put on a new attitude, a new disposition, to fit those foul-smelling baggy pants and the old boots.
The best cover story in the world won't protect you if you cannot live that cover.
Now that Al has stayed with his friend in Enemy Town long enough to build up his recent past, he's ready to establish himself in the capital of the Enemy Area.
Here it is. The big city.
Where do I go from here?
Geez, I've got to look like I know where I'm going.
Provisional quarters.
What did they tell me about this back at the schools?
Provisional quarters.
A big hotel. How about that?
Lots of people. Easy to lose myself in there.
Full of loose talk.
Might get a chance to pick up a little info.
But remember what we told you, Al.
That's why informers like them, too.
That's why the desk clerks, the maids, the waiters, and the bellboys are all on the payroll of the secret police.
And how about conformity to cover?
What's a mechanic doing at the best hotel?
A paying guest with a family.
That's a possibility.
It's the sort of thing a fella like me might look for after being laid up.
And if the family turned out to be sympathetic...
Boarding with a family is a good idea, if you know the family.
If they're overly suspicious, it's too easy for them to keep tabs on you.
And if they're overly friendly, they might restrict your movements too much.
No, better keep on going, Al.
But keep it in mind when you're ready for permanent quarters.
A lodging house. That's the sort of place a mechanic might go.
And there's too many of them in town for the cops to check them all.
I'm running a respectable house!
The nerve of him, bringing that hussy right upstairs!
Forget that talkative landlady, Al.
She'll be watching you like a hawk.
No matter how discreet you are, she'll find something to talk about.
I run a respectable household.
The very idea!
I gave him a piece of my mind, I did.
Now here's an idea. A streetwalker's apartment.
The most natural thing in the world.
No register. No questions asked.
Why, it's just what I need to get me over the hill on my first night in a strange city.
Sorry to spoil your fun, Al, but remember every prostitute's an informer, or a potential informer, and that's a good reason for staying out of brothels, too.
Plus the fact that l'amour is constantly being interrupted by snap controls.
How about this?
